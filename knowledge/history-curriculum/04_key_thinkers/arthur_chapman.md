# Arthur Chapman: Historical Interpretation and the Development of Historical Thinking

## Introduction: A Leading Voice in History Education

Arthur Chapman is Professor of History Education at the UCL Institute of Education, one of the world's leading centres for research in history pedagogy. His work has been instrumental in shaping contemporary understanding of how students develop historical thinking, particularly in relation to historical interpretations, evidence, and accounts. As Head of Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment at the IOE since 2023, Chapman has assumed a significant leadership role in teacher education and research at both national and international levels.

Chapman's scholarship represents a distinctive contribution to the "second-order" tradition in history education research—an approach pioneered by colleagues at the University of Leeds including Peter Lee, Rosalyn Ashby, and Denis Shemilt. This tradition distinguishes between "first-order" substantive knowledge (the content of history: dates, events, people) and "second-order" procedural knowledge (how history works as a discipline: evidence, interpretation, causation, change and continuity). Chapman's work illuminates the developmental progression through which students come to understand history as a form of knowledge constructed through disciplined inquiry rather than as a fixed body of facts to be memorised.

His research interests centre on three interconnected areas: children's historical thinking, particularly their understanding of historical interpretations; teaching and learning about historical accounts and evidence; and the relationship between academic history and school history. Chapman has published extensively in leading journals and has co-edited influential collections that have shaped the field internationally.

## Academic Background and Career Trajectory

Arthur Chapman holds an MA from Cambridge, an MPhil, and an EdD from the UCL Institute of Education. His doctoral research at the IOE established the foundation for his subsequent work on historical interpretation, and he has remained at the Institute throughout his academic career, rising through the ranks to his current position as Professor.

In June 2023, Chapman was appointed Head of Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment at the IOE—a role that places him at the centre of developments in teacher education and curriculum research. In addition to this leadership position, he serves as Programme Leader for the Doctor in Education (EdD) programme, where he oversees the development of advanced practitioners and researchers in education.

Chapman's institutional affiliation at the IOE is significant. The Institute has been a crucible for history education research since the 1970s, producing seminal work on children's historical thinking under the direction of researchers including Peter Lee. Chapman represents a new generation of this tradition, maintaining its rigorous standards whilst extending its reach into new areas of inquiry.

## Core Contributions to History Education

### Historical Interpretations: The Centrality of Represented Pasts

Chapman's most significant contribution lies in his work on historical interpretations. In his influential chapter "Historical Interpretations" in *Debates in History Teaching* (2nd edition, 2017), Chapman argues that learning history and negotiating the present both require "the ability to identify, comprehend, explain and evaluate historical interpretations." This framing positions historical interpretation not merely as one concept among many, but as foundational to the entire enterprise of history education.

Building on the distinction between first-order and second-order concepts established by the Leeds tradition, Chapman demonstrates that understanding history requires students to recognise that all historical accounts are interpretations—representations of the past constructed by historians working with evidence, operating within particular contexts, and addressing specific questions. This is a sophisticated epistemological position that develops gradually through the school years.

Chapman's research has mapped this developmental progression in detail. Working with longitudinal data and classroom-based studies, he has identified stages through which students move in their understanding of historical interpretation:

**The Pre-Interpretive Stage**: Younger students or those new to rigorous history often view historical accounts as transparent windows onto the past. They see textbooks as simply "telling what happened" without recognising the constructive role of the historian. At this stage, differences between accounts are attributed to error, omission, or lack of information.

**The Emerging Interpretation Stage**: Students begin to recognise that historians may select different information or emphasise different aspects of the past. However, they often explain these differences in terms of bias, partiality, or the historian's personal opinions, without understanding the disciplinary conventions and evidential constraints that shape historical argument.

**The Disciplinary Interpretation Stage**: More sophisticated students understand that historical interpretations are shaped by the questions historians ask, the methods they employ, the evidence available to them, and the contexts in which they work. They recognise that historians operate within traditions of inquiry and debate, and that interpretation is an ongoing, collective enterprise.

**The Meta-Interpretive Stage**: At the highest level, students can evaluate interpretations not only in terms of their evidential basis but also in relation to the broader historiographical context, recognising how different approaches (social history, political history, cultural history, etc.) generate different but potentially complementary perspectives on the past.

This progression model has profound implications for pedagogy. Rather than treating historical interpretation as a concept to be "taught" in a single unit, Chapman advocates for a spiral curriculum in which students repeatedly encounter and grapple with the constructed nature of historical knowledge across different contexts and at increasing levels of sophistication.

### First-Order and Second-Order Knowledge: The Integration Challenge

A central theme in Chapman's work is the relationship between first-order and second-order historical knowledge. First-order knowledge refers to substantive content: the "stuff" of history—events, periods, individuals, and societies. Second-order knowledge refers to the procedures and concepts through which historians work: evidence, interpretation, causation, change and continuity.

In his 2011 paper "Understanding Historical Knowing: Evidence and Accounts," published in *The Future of the Past: Why History Education Matters*, Chapman challenges simplistic binary thinking that separates these two dimensions. Drawing on classroom practice and systematic research, he argues that first-order and second-order knowledge are "logically inter-related and inseparable in practical terms." Understanding what happened (first-order) is inseparable from understanding how we know what happened (second-order).

This insight has significant implications for curriculum design and pedagogy. Chapman explores how the notion of historical "enquiry," as developed by Christine Counsell and others, can serve as a pedagogic tool for the simultaneous development of both dimensions. Rather than treating substantive knowledge as a prerequisite for disciplinary thinking, or vice versa, Chapman advocates for approaches in which students build substantive knowledge through engagement with historical questions and problems that require them to deploy disciplinary procedures.

### The Progression Model for Historical Thinking

Chapman's work on progression in historical thinking has been influential in shaping both assessment frameworks and classroom practice. In 2015, he developed the Pearson Historical Thinking Progression Map, which articulates the stages through which students develop understanding of key historical concepts.

This work draws on the "blocker" and "builder" model developed by Peter Lee. "Blockers" are misconceptions or naive conceptions that impede students' progress in historical thinking—ideas such as "the past is just there to be discovered" or "historians just report the facts." "Builders" are more sophisticated understandings that enable further development—ideas such as "historians construct accounts based on evidence" or "interpretations reflect the questions and contexts of historians."

Chapman's progression model maps how students move from blockers to builders across multiple dimensions of historical thinking:

**Evidence and Sources**: Students progress from viewing sources as information to be extracted, to recognising sources as evidence that must be interrogated and contextualised, to understanding the inferential relationship between evidence and historical claims.

**Historical Accounts**: Students progress from viewing accounts as transparent records of the past, to seeing them as partial perspectives influenced by authorial bias, to understanding them as constructed interpretations shaped by evidential, methodological, and contextual factors.

**Causation**: Students progress from single-factor explanations, to multiple causes treated as separate factors, to understanding the relationships between causes (necessary, sufficient, contributory) and the criteria historians use to assign causal significance.

**Change and Continuity**: Students progress from viewing change as event-based, to recognising patterns of change over time, to understanding the ways in which historians periodise and narrate change.

This progression framework provides a developmental lens through which teachers can view student work, diagnose misconceptions, and design learning activities that challenge students to move towards more sophisticated understandings.

### Historical Consciousness and Meaning Making

Chapman's more recent work has engaged with the concept of historical consciousness—the relationship between understanding the past and orienting oneself in the present. Collaborating with Arie Wilschut and others, Chapman has contributed to international debates about how history education can foster the kind of historical thinking that enables students to navigate contemporary challenges.

In the 2022 article "How Meaning Making Cultivates Historical Consciousness," published in *Teaching History*, Chapman and colleagues argue that history education must go beyond the transmission of information to support students in developing the capacity to make meaning from the past. This involves not only disciplinary procedures but also the ability to connect past and present, to recognise the contingency of historical developments, and to engage with multiple perspectives on the past.

Chapman's work in this area connects the Anglo-American tradition of history education research with European and international perspectives, enriching both. He has been particularly influential in highlighting how historical consciousness involves both the disciplinary skills of the historian and the orientational function of history in society—the ways in which understandings of the past shape individual and collective identities and inform contemporary decision-making.

## Pedagogical Applications and Classroom Strategies

### Developing Understanding of Historical Interpretation

Chapman's research has informed specific pedagogical strategies for developing students' understanding of historical interpretation. In his 2012 study "They Have Come to Differing Opinions Because of Their Differing Interpretations," published in the *International Journal of Historical Learning, Teaching and Research*, Chapman evaluated an online inter-institutional discussion project designed to develop 16-19 year-old students' understanding of historical interpretation.

The study found that structured dialogue between students, and between students and historians, could accelerate the development of sophisticated understandings of interpretation. Key elements of the approach included:

**Juxtaposing Multiple Accounts**: Students encountered contrasting interpretations of the same historical events or developments, requiring them to explain differences rather than simply choosing between accounts.

**Making Criteria Explicit**: Students were supported to identify the criteria historians use in constructing and evaluating interpretations—evidential basis, coherence, explanatory power, and so on.

**Engaging in Dialogic Reasoning**: Through structured discussion, students were required to articulate their own understandings, respond to alternative perspectives, and refine their thinking in light of evidence and argument.

**Connecting to Historiographical Context**: Students were introduced to the broader contexts of historical debate, helping them understand how interpretations relate to different schools of historical thought and different historical periods.

This research demonstrates that understanding historical interpretation can be taught—and that carefully designed pedagogical interventions can support significant progression in students' thinking.

### Teaching Causal Reasoning

Chapman has also contributed to pedagogy around causal reasoning in history. His Teaching History article "Camels, Diamonds and Counterfactuals" (issue 112) presents a model for teaching causal reasoning that addresses common student misconceptions and supports progression in causal thinking.

The article highlights the importance of helping students move beyond listing multiple causes to understanding the relationships between causes—the ways in which some causes are necessary, others sufficient, and others contributory. Chapman argues that counterfactual thinking (considering what might have happened if particular factors had been different) can be a powerful tool for developing causal reasoning, provided it is used with appropriate scaffolding.

### Evidence and the Inferential Process

Building on his work with Denis Shemilt and others, Chapman has developed pedagogical approaches that help students understand the inferential relationship between evidence and historical claims. Rather than viewing sources as repositories of information to be mined, students are taught to see evidence as material from which historians construct arguments through a process of questioning, inference, and corroboration.

This involves teaching students to:

**Interrogate Sources**: To ask questions of sources about their provenance, context, and perspective before drawing conclusions.

**Make Inferences**: To recognise that historical claims must be justified by evidence and that the relationship between evidence and claim is inferential rather than direct.

**Corroborate Across Sources**: To check claims against multiple sources, recognising both when sources agree and when they conflict, and developing strategies for resolving or acknowledging conflicts.

**Evaluate Sufficiency**: To assess whether the available evidence is sufficient to support particular claims, recognising the limits of historical knowledge.

## Major Publications and Edited Collections

Arthur Chapman has an extensive publication record spanning journal articles, book chapters, and edited collections. His major works include:

### Books and Edited Collections

**Joined-up History: New Directions in History Education Research** (2015), co-edited with Arie Wilschut. This collection brings together leading international researchers to explore connections between different areas of history education research. The volume addresses the relationship between historical thinking and historical content, between academic history and school history, and between research and practice.

**Knowing History in Schools** (UCL Press, 2020), co-edited with Catherine McCrory. This collection engages with debates about "powerful knowledge" in history education, drawing on the work of Michael Young and the social realist tradition. Chapman contributes a chapter on "Powerful Knowledge Building and Conceptual Change Research," exploring how research on students' understanding of historical accounts can inform curriculum design.

**Debates in History Teaching** (2nd edition, 2017), edited by Ian Davies. Chapman's chapter on "Historical Interpretations" is one of the most cited recent contributions to this standard reference work for history teachers.

**The Future of the Past: Why History Education Matters** (2011), edited by Lukas Perikleous and Denis Shemilt. Chapman's chapter "Understanding Historical Knowing: Evidence and Accounts" articulates his integrative approach to first-order and second-order knowledge.

### Key Journal Articles

"They Have Come to Differing Opinions Because of Their Differing Interpretations" (2012), *International Journal of Historical Learning, Teaching and Research*. Reports a study of online discussion as a means of developing students' understanding of historical interpretation.

"Dialogue Between the Source and the Historian's View Occurs" (2015), co-authored with Emma Goldsmith. Published in *Joined-up History*, this paper maps changes in student thinking about historical accounts in expert and peer online discussion.

"Camels, Diamonds and Counterfactuals" (Teaching History 112). Presents a model for teaching causal reasoning that addresses progression and common misconceptions.

## Influence on Curriculum and Assessment

Chapman's work has had significant influence on curriculum and assessment developments in England and internationally. The Pearson Historical Thinking Progression Map, which he developed in 2015, has informed the design of resources and assessments that aim to assess students' conceptual understanding rather than merely their recall of substantive content.

His research on historical interpretation has been particularly influential in shaping how examination boards and curriculum designers approach the assessment of this challenging concept. By articulating clear progression models, Chapman has helped make the assessment of historical thinking more transparent and valid.

At the UCL Institute of Education, Chapman's leadership in the EdD programme and his role as Head of Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment have positioned him to influence the development of a new generation of history education researchers and teacher educators. His commitment to connecting research and practice ensures that his scholarship has immediate relevance to classroom teachers.

## International Reach and Collaboration

Chapman's influence extends well beyond the United Kingdom. He is co-investigator on the KOSS Network (Knowledge and Quality in Subject Education), funded by the Swedish Research Council, which brings together researchers from multiple countries to explore questions of knowledge and quality in subject teaching.

His work on historical consciousness has connected him with European researchers, contributing to a productive dialogue between the Anglo-American tradition of history education research and the continental European tradition of historical consciousness and historical culture. This international perspective enriches his scholarship and ensures that his work speaks to diverse educational contexts.

Chapman has been a regular contributor to international conferences including those of the International Society for History Didactics and the European Association for History Education. His research has been cited by scholars in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, demonstrating its broad relevance.

## Classroom Implications: Teaching with Chapman's Insights

For classroom teachers, Chapman's work offers several key implications:

### Plan for Progression in Historical Interpretation

Rather than treating historical interpretation as a concept to be covered in a single unit, teachers should plan for progression across the curriculum. Students should encounter the constructed nature of historical knowledge repeatedly, at increasing levels of sophistication. Early encounters might focus on recognising that different sources say different things; later work should address the complex factors shaping historical interpretation.

### Integrate First-Order and Second-Order Learning

Chapman's research demonstrates that substantive and disciplinary learning are inseparable. Teachers should design enquiries in which students build knowledge of the past through engagement with disciplinary questions and problems. For example, rather than teaching "what happened" in the Norman Conquest and then separately considering "why interpretations differ," teachers can structure enquiries in which understanding of events develops through examination of contrasting interpretations.

### Use Structured Dialogue

Chapman's research on online discussion suggests that structured dialogue—whether face-to-face or mediated by technology—can accelerate the development of historical thinking. Teachers should create opportunities for students to articulate their understandings, respond to alternative perspectives, and refine their thinking through discussion.

### Make Blockers and Builders Explicit

Understanding common misconceptions (blockers) and more sophisticated alternatives (builders) can help teachers diagnose student thinking and design targeted interventions. When a student explains differences between interpretations solely in terms of bias, the teacher recognises a particular misconception and can plan instruction to move towards more sophisticated understandings.

### Connect to the Discipline

Chapman's work emphasises the importance of connecting school history to the discipline of academic history. Teachers should expose students to the work of historians, helping them understand how professional historical knowledge is constructed and debated. This might involve reading extracts from historians, engaging with online resources, or participating in projects that connect classrooms with university researchers.

## Current Research Directions

According to his UCL profile, Chapman is currently engaged in classroom research on two major projects: children's thinking about historical narrative, and intervention studies to improve causal reasoning. These projects continue his commitment to research that engages directly with classroom practice and has immediate implications for pedagogy.

The focus on historical narrative reflects a growing recognition in the field that understanding history requires not only grasping individual concepts (evidence, interpretation, causation) but also understanding how historians construct narratives that connect events into coherent accounts. This work promises to illuminate the developmental progression in understanding historical narrative and to inform pedagogical strategies for supporting this progression.

The intervention studies in causal reasoning represent a further development of Chapman
