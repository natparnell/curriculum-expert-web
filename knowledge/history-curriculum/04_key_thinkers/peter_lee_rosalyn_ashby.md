# Peter Lee and Rosalyn Ashby: Mapping Historical Understanding

## Introduction

Peter Lee and Rosalyn Ashby stand as two of the most influential figures in the empirical study of children's historical thinking. Their collaborative work, particularly through the Concepts of History and Teaching Approaches (CHATA) project, has fundamentally transformed our understanding of how young people learn history and how educators can support their development. While their work is deeply connected to Denis Shemilt's contributions to the Schools History Project, Lee and Ashby brought distinctive methodological rigour and theoretical sophistication to the study of historical cognition.

The CHATA project, conducted throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, mapped how students' understanding of second-order historical concepts—such as evidence, accounts, causation, change, and empathy—develops between the ages of seven and fourteen. This research revealed that progression in historical thinking follows identifiable patterns, and that students are capable of far more sophisticated historical reasoning than had previously been assumed. The project's findings have informed curriculum design, assessment frameworks, and pedagogical approaches in England and internationally.

This profile examines Lee and Ashby's contributions to history education research, with particular attention to their work on progression in historical understanding, their conceptualisation of second-order concepts, their research methodology, and their influence on classroom practice. It also explores the relationship between their work and broader theoretical frameworks, including Jörn Rüsen's theories of historical consciousness.

## Background and Career

### Peter Lee

Peter Lee's career has been dedicated to understanding how children think about the past and how history education can support the development of historical understanding. His work bridges philosophy of history, cognitive psychology, and educational research, bringing conceptual clarity to questions about what it means to learn and teach history.

Lee's intellectual formation was influenced by the analytical philosophy of history that flourished in Britain during the mid-twentieth century. This philosophical tradition, concerned with questions about the nature of historical explanation, the status of historical knowledge, and the logic of historical inquiry, provided Lee with conceptual tools for thinking about the disciplinary foundations of history education. His early work explored questions about the nature of historical understanding and the relationship between substantive historical knowledge and procedural historical concepts.

Lee's career has been based primarily at the Institute of Education, University of London (now part of University College London), where he worked closely with Rosalyn Ashby and Denis Shemilt on the CHATA project. His research has focused on developing theoretical frameworks for understanding how children think about history and on generating empirical evidence about the development of historical understanding.

Lee's contribution extends beyond research to encompass curriculum development and teacher education. His work has informed the National Curriculum for History in England, and his publications in *Teaching History*—the journal of the Historical Association—have been influential in shaping classroom practice. His ability to translate complex theoretical ideas into practical guidance for teachers has made his work particularly valuable for the teaching profession.

### Rosalyn Ashby

Rosalyn Ashby is a lecturer in education based in the History in Education Unit at the UCL Institute of Education. Her work focuses on designing history curricula, assessment systems, and support materials for teachers. Like Lee, her research has been centrally concerned with understanding how students think about history and how educational interventions can support their development.

Ashby's contribution to the CHATA project was particularly significant in developing research methodologies for accessing students' historical thinking. The clinical interviewing techniques that the project employed—designed to probe students' conceptual understanding rather than merely their factual knowledge—owed much to Ashby's methodological expertise. Her work has focused on how students approach questions of historical evidence, how they validate historical claims, and how their ideas about history develop over time.

Ashby's research has also addressed questions of assessment in history education. Her work on designing assessment tasks that target conceptual understanding rather than merely factual recall has been influential in developing approaches to assessing historical thinking. She has been particularly concerned with the practical implications of research for classroom teaching, working to ensure that insights from the CHATA project could be translated into effective pedagogy.

### The Schools History Project Context

Lee and Ashby's work emerged from and contributed to the Schools History Project (SHP) tradition. The SHP, established in the 1970s under the leadership of David Sylvester and subsequently directed by Denis Shemilt, had demonstrated that students taught through enquiry-based approaches could think in more sophisticated ways about the past than traditional pedagogy had assumed.

The CHATA project can be understood as a sustained investigation into the cognitive foundations of the SHP approach. If the SHP had shown that students were capable of historical thinking, CHATA sought to understand how that thinking developed, what obstacles students encountered, and how teaching could be designed to support progression. Lee, Ashby, and Shemilt collaborated closely on this research, with Lee and Ashby often focusing on the empirical investigation of students' ideas while Shemilt brought his expertise in evaluation and curriculum development.

## The CHATA Project: Concepts of History and Teaching Approaches

### Origins and Aims

The Concepts of History and Teaching Approaches (CHATA) project was established to investigate how students' ideas about history develop between the ages of seven and fourteen. The project's name reflects its dual focus: on the conceptual understanding that constitutes historical thinking, and on the teaching approaches that can support its development.

The CHATA project built directly on the foundations laid by the Schools History Project evaluation conducted by Denis Shemilt in the 1980s. Where Shemilt's evaluation had established that students taught through enquiry-based methods demonstrated more sophisticated historical understanding, CHATA sought to map in detail how that understanding developed and what patterns characterised students' thinking at different stages.

The project's central research question concerned progression: how do students' ideas about history change as they grow older and as they encounter history teaching? This question was not merely academic; it had profound implications for curriculum design, teaching, and assessment. If educators understood how historical thinking developed, they could design more effective instruction and assess students' understanding more appropriately.

### Research Methodology

The CHATA methodology was distinctive in its approach to investigating students' historical thinking. Rather than relying on standardised tests or written assessments, the project employed clinical interviewing techniques designed to access students' conceptual understanding.

**Clinical Interviewing**

The project's primary research method involved extensive one-to-one interviews with students, using carefully designed tasks that probed their understanding of historical concepts. These interviews were "clinical" in the sense that they were adapted to the individual student, with the researcher following up on the student's responses to probe their thinking in depth.

The interview tasks were designed to reveal students' tacit assumptions about the nature of history. For example, rather than asking students to recall historical facts, the tasks might present them with historical sources and ask them how they could know what happened in the past, or present them with conflicting accounts and ask them how they could determine which was correct. These tasks were designed to elicit students' ideas about evidence, accounts, and historical knowledge.

**Sample and Data Collection**

The project collected data from approximately 600 students across 9 schools (3 primary and 6 secondary) in England. The students ranged in age from 7 to 14, allowing the researchers to track how ideas developed across this crucial period of education. Data collection extended over several years, enabling the researchers to follow some students' development over time.

The scale of data collection was substantial. Students completed written tasks and participated in interviews that were audio-recorded and transcribed. The resulting corpus of data provided the foundation for detailed qualitative analysis of students' historical thinking.

**Analytical Approach**

The analysis of CHATA data involved identifying patterns in students' responses and characterising different ways of thinking about historical concepts. The researchers were not interested merely in whether students' answers were "correct" or "incorrect" according to disciplinary standards; they sought to understand the conceptual frameworks through which students made sense of historical questions.

This analytical approach revealed that students' ideas about history were not random or idiosyncratic but followed identifiable patterns. Students at similar stages of development tended to approach historical questions in similar ways, and these approaches could be characterised and organised into progression models.

### Key Findings

The CHATA project generated findings that transformed understanding of students' historical thinking:

**Early Competence**

One of the most significant findings was that young students were capable of far more sophisticated historical thinking than had previously been assumed. The CHATA research demonstrated that students as young as seven could engage with questions about historical evidence and accounts, and that their thinking about these matters, while different from that of older students, was not merely deficient or simplistic.

This finding challenged assumptions about the age at which historical concepts could be introduced. Where previous thinking had often assumed that young children were not ready for abstract historical concepts, CHATA demonstrated that the foundations of historical thinking could be laid in primary education.

**Persistent Preconceptions**

The research also revealed that students brought powerful preconceptions about history to their learning—preconceptions that could persist even as students encountered formal history instruction. For example, many students approached the past with what might be called "naïve realism," assuming that the past was directly accessible and that historical accounts simply recorded what happened.

These preconceptions were not merely errors to be corrected; they represented coherent ways of thinking about the past that made sense from the student's perspective. Effective teaching needed to engage with these preconceptions, making them explicit and subject to critical examination, rather than simply overriding them with more sophisticated ideas.

**Progression Models**

The project's most influential output was the development of progression models for key historical concepts. These models characterised how students' thinking about concepts such as evidence, accounts, causation, and change developed, identifying characteristic ways of thinking at different stages and the pathways through which students moved from simpler to more sophisticated understanding.

These models were not prescriptive; they did not dictate what students should be able to do at particular ages. Rather, they were descriptive, characterising how students' thinking actually developed when exposed to effective teaching. They provided teachers with diagnostic tools for identifying where students were in their conceptual development and what next steps might be productive.

## Second-Order Concepts: The Architecture of Historical Understanding

### The Distinction Between First-Order and Second-Order Concepts

A central contribution of Lee and Ashby's work has been the elaboration of the distinction between first-order and second-order concepts in history. This distinction, which had been implicit in the Schools History Project approach, was developed through CHATA research into a sophisticated theoretical framework.

**First-Order Concepts**

First-order concepts are the substantive concepts of history: the names, dates, events, people, and processes that constitute historical content. These include concepts such as "the Norman Conquest," "the Industrial Revolution," "slavery," or "democracy." Learning first-order concepts involves acquiring knowledge about the past—knowing what happened, when, where, and to whom.

First-order concepts are essential to historical understanding; one cannot think historically without knowing something about the past. However, Lee and Ashby's research demonstrated that knowledge of first-order concepts, while necessary, is not sufficient for historical understanding.

**Second-Order Concepts**

Second-order concepts are the procedural or disciplinary concepts that define what it means to think historically. These include concepts such as:

- **Evidence**: Understanding how we know about the past, how sources can be used as evidence, and the relationship between sources and historical claims.

- **Accounts**: Understanding that historical accounts are constructed, that they involve selection and interpretation, and that different accounts of the same events may be valid.

- **Cause**: Understanding how to explain historical events and changes, recognising the complexity of causation, and distinguishing between necessary and sufficient conditions.

- **Change and Continuity**: Understanding how to characterise change over time, recognising different patterns and scales of change, and identifying what persists across time.

- **Historical Empathy**: Understanding how to interpret past actors' beliefs and actions in their own terms, recognising the difference between past and present perspectives.

- **Historical Significance**: Understanding how to determine what is significant in the past, recognising that significance is attributed rather than inherent.

Second-order concepts are not additional content to be learned alongside first-order concepts; they constitute the forms of thinking through which first-order content is understood. As Lee has argued, "we cannot help children make progress in history without paying close attention to how they conceptualise the history we ask them to learn."

### The Development of Second-Order Understanding

Lee and Ashby's research traced how understanding of second-order concepts develops. This development is not simply a matter of accumulating more information about the past; it involves qualitative changes in how students think about history.

For example, students' understanding of historical evidence typically develops from naïve realism (the assumption that sources simply tell us what happened) through recognition of the need to evaluate sources (considering questions of reliability and bias) to more sophisticated understanding of how sources are used as evidence (recognising that the same source may be used to answer different questions and that the status of a source depends on the question being asked).

Similarly, students' understanding of historical accounts develops from the assumption that accounts differ because one is right and the other wrong, through recognition that accounts may differ because of bias or perspective, to understanding that accounts differ because historians ask different questions and employ different concepts and frameworks.

These developmental patterns are not rigid or deterministic; students may be at different stages with respect to different concepts, and progression is not inevitable—it requires appropriate teaching. However, the CHATA research revealed that students' thinking does develop in recognisable ways, and that this development can be supported through carefully designed instruction.

## Progression in Historical Understanding

### The Concept of Progression

Lee and Ashby's work has been centrally concerned with the concept of progression—the idea that students' historical understanding develops over time, and that this development can be characterised and supported. Their approach to progression differs significantly from earlier models that assumed development was simply a matter of accumulating more historical knowledge.

In their influential 2003 article "A Scaffold, Not a Cage: Progression and Progression Models in History" (co-authored with Denis Shemilt), Lee and Ashby argued that progression models should serve as scaffolding to support teaching and learning, not as cages that constrain or limit. This metaphor captures a crucial insight: understanding how students' thinking develops should inform teaching, but should not become a rigid framework that prevents teachers from responding to individual students' needs.

### Characteristics of Progression

Lee and Ashby identified several key characteristics of progression in historical understanding:

**Conceptual Change**

Progression involves conceptual change—qualitative shifts in how students think about history, not merely the accumulation of more facts. A student who understands causation in more sophisticated terms has not simply learned more causes; they have developed a different way of thinking about what it means to explain historical events.

**Differentiated Development**

Students may progress at different rates with respect to different concepts. A student may have sophisticated understanding of evidence but more naïve understanding of causation, or vice versa. This means that teachers need to attend to students' understanding of specific concepts, not assume a general level of "historical understanding."

**The Role of Preconceptions**

Progression is not simply a matter of replacing ignorance with knowledge. Students bring powerful preconceptions about history to their learning, and these preconceptions can persist even as students encounter formal instruction. Effective teaching must engage with these preconceptions, making them explicit and subject to critical examination.

**The Importance of Context**

Progression is context-dependent. The CHATA research demonstrated that students' ability to think historically depends on the context: the particular question being asked, the sources available, the concepts being employed. Students who demonstrate sophisticated understanding in one context may revert to more naïve thinking in another.

### Research-Based Progression Models

The CHATA project developed detailed progression models for key historical concepts. These models characterise how students' thinking develops, identifying characteristic approaches at different stages and the pathways through which students move from simpler to more sophisticated understanding.

These models are research-based, grounded in extensive empirical investigation of students' thinking. They are descriptive rather than prescriptive, characterising how students' thinking actually develops rather than dictating what they should be able to do at particular ages. They are also tentative and subject to revision as more research becomes available.

The progression models have been influential in curriculum design and assessment. They inform the National Curriculum for History in England and have been used to develop assessment frameworks that target conceptual understanding rather than merely factual recall.

## Historical Accounts: The 2004 Study

### The Problem of Historical Accounts

One of Lee and Ashby's most influential studies examined students' understanding of historical accounts. Published in 2004 as "'I Just Wish We Could Go Back in the Past and Find Out What Really Happened': Progression in Understanding about Historical Accounts" (co-authored with Denis Shemilt), this research probed how students understand the nature of historical accounts and why they differ.

The title of the article captures a common student response: the desire to bypass the complexity of historical interpretation and access "what really happened." This response reveals a powerful preconception about history—that the past is directly accessible and that historical accounts simply record it. The research investigated how students' understanding of accounts develops beyond this naïve realism.

### Progression in Understanding Accounts

The research identified a progression in students' understanding of historical accounts:

**Naïve Realism**

At the earliest stage, students assume that the past is directly accessible and that accounts simply record what happened. If accounts differ, one must be right and the other wrong. The task of the historian is to find the "true" account by accessing the past directly—hence the wish to "go back in the past and find out what really happened."

**Recognition of Bias**

As students develop, they recognise that accounts may differ because of bias—because the author has a particular perspective or agenda. This represents progress from naïve realism, but it is still relatively crude: accounts are evaluated as more or less "biased," with the goal of finding an unbiased account that tells "what really happened."

**Recognition of Perspective**

More sophisticated understanding recognises that accounts differ because of perspective—because authors see the past from different positions, with different questions and concerns. This is not simply a matter of bias; different perspectives may yield different but equally valid accounts.

**Recognition of Construction**

At more sophisticated levels, students understand that historical accounts are constructed, involving selection, interpretation, and the application of concepts. Different accounts may reflect different conceptual frameworks, different questions, and different criteria of significance. This does not mean that all accounts are equally valid; rather, it means that evaluating accounts requires understanding the frameworks within which they are constructed.

**Dialogical Understanding**

The most sophisticated understanding involves what might be called dialogical thinking: the capacity to engage with multiple accounts, recognising their different perspectives and frameworks, and using this understanding to develop richer, more nuanced understanding of the past. This involves not merely recognising that accounts differ, but understanding how they can be brought into productive dialogue.

### Pedagogical Implications

Lee and Ashby's research on historical accounts has significant implications for pedagogy:

- **Early introduction**: Students can begin engaging with questions about historical accounts from an early age. The research demonstrates that even young students can recognise that accounts may differ and begin to think about why.

- **Explicit attention to preconceptions**: Teachers need to attend to students' preconceptions about historical accounts, making them explicit and subject to examination. Without this, teaching may fail to engage with students' existing ideas.

- **Scaffolded engagement with multiple accounts**: Students need opportunities to engage with multiple accounts of the same events, supported by teaching that helps them understand why accounts differ and how they can be evaluated.

- **Avoiding premature scepticism**: While students need to understand that accounts are constructed and contested, introducing this idea too early can lead to cynicism about historical knowledge. The research suggests that progression involves both recognising the constructed nature of accounts and understanding how historians make warranted claims about the past.

## Historical Consciousness and Orientation in Time

### Lee's Engagement with Jörn Rüsen

Peter Lee has engaged extensively with the German historian and theorist Jörn Rüsen's work on historical consciousness. Rüsen's theory offers a framework for understanding how individuals and societies orient themselves in time through historical narratives. Lee has explored the implications of Rüsen's work for history education, examining how teaching history can contribute to the development of historical consciousness.

In his 2004 paper "'Walking Backwards into Tomorrow': Historical Consciousness and Understanding History," Lee examined Rüsen's typology of historical consciousness and its relevance for history education. Rüsen identifies four types of historical consciousness:

- **Traditional**: History is understood as providing models and lessons from the past. The past is seen as a repository of wisdom that can guide present action.

- **Exemplary**: History provides examples of human conduct, both positive and negative. The past is studied for the lessons it offers for the present.

- **Critical**: History is understood as involving the critical examination of traditions and assumptions. The past is not merely accepted but subjected to critical scrutiny.

- **Genetic**: History is understood as showing how the present emerged from the past. The past is seen as a process of development that has produced the present.

Lee's engagement with Rüsen's typology has informed thinking about the purposes of history education. Rather than viewing history as merely the transmission of knowledge about the past, this framework suggests that history education should contribute to students' ability to orient themselves in time—to understand how the present has been shaped by the past and how the future might be shaped by present actions.

### Implications for History Education

The concept of historical consciousness has significant implications for how we think about history education:

- **Purpose beyond content**: History education is not merely about learning what happened in the past; it is about developing the capacity to think historically and to orient oneself in time.

- **Narrative and identity**: Historical consciousness involves the construction of narratives that connect past, present, and future. These narratives are related to individual and collective identity.

- **Critical engagement**: Effective history education should develop critical historical consciousness—the capacity to examine historical narratives critically rather than accept them uncritically.

- **Orientation toward the future**: Historical consciousness is not merely about the past; it is about understanding the present and orienting oneself toward the future.

## Assessment in History Education

### Assessing Conceptual Understanding

Lee and Ashby's research has significant implications for assessment in history education. If the goal of history education is to develop conceptual understanding of second-order concepts, assessment must target that understanding rather than merely testing factual recall.

The CHATA research demonstrated that assessment tasks can be designed to probe students' conceptual understanding. By presenting students with novel historical problems—questions they have not previously encountered—assessment can reveal how they apply historical concepts rather than merely what they remember.

For example, rather than asking students to recall facts about a particular topic, assessment might present them with sources about an unfamiliar topic and ask them to use the sources as evidence to answer a historical question. This reveals their understanding of evidence as a concept—their ideas about how sources can be used to make warranted claims about the past.

### The Problem of Valid Assessment

Lee and Ashby's work has highlighted the challenges of valid assessment in history. Traditional assessments often fail to capture students' conceptual understanding, focusing instead on factual recall. This can give a misleading picture of students' historical understanding: a student who can remember many facts may nevertheless have naïve understanding of historical concepts.

The CHATA research has informed the development of assessment approaches that target conceptual understanding. These include:

- **Diagnostic tasks**: Tasks designed to reveal students' current conceptual understanding, enabling teachers to plan instruction that addresses their needs.

- **Progress-monitoring assessments**: Assessments that track students' development over time, revealing whether they are making progress in their conceptual understanding.

- **Summative assessments**: Assessments that evaluate students' achievement, targeting the conceptual understanding that represents the goals of history education.

## Influence on Curriculum and Policy

### The National Curriculum

Lee and Ashby's research has influenced the National Curriculum for History in England. The emphasis on second-order concepts—evidence, accounts, cause, change, and significance—that characterises the National Curriculum reflects the findings of the CHATA project.

The progression models developed through CHATA have informed thinking about how the curriculum should be structured to support the development of historical understanding. Rather than organising the curriculum around topics to be covered, the National Curriculum is organised around concepts to be developed, with content serving as the context for developing conceptual understanding.

### Teacher Education

Lee and Ashby's work has been influential in teacher education. Their research has informed programmes of initial teacher education and continuing professional development, helping teachers understand how students think about history and how teaching can support their development.

Publications in *Teaching History* have been particularly influential in this regard. Lee and Ashby have consistently sought to make their research accessible to teachers, translating complex theoretical ideas into practical guidance for classroom practice.

### International Influence

The CHATA research has had significant international influence. The project's findings have informed history education in many countries, and its methodology has been adopted and adapted by researchers internationally.

Lee and Ashby have contributed to international debates about history education, participating in conferences and collaborations with researchers from many countries. Their work has been particularly influential in Europe and North America, where it has informed both research and practice.

## Key Publications

### "Progression in Historical Understanding among Students Ages 7-14" (2000)

This chapter, published in *Knowing, Teaching and Learning History: National and International Perspectives* (edited by Peter Stearns, Peter Seixas, and Sam Wineburg), presents the CHATA project's findings on how students' historical understanding develops.

## Relationship to Christine Counsell's Framework

### Complementary Perspectives

Lee and Ashby's work is deeply complementary to Christine Counsell's curriculum framework. While Counsell has focused primarily on curriculum design and the architecture of the history curriculum, Lee and Ashby have focused on the empirical study of how students learn history. These perspectives inform each other: Counsell's framework provides the structure within which Lee and Ashby's insights about learning can be applied, while Lee and Ashby's research provides the empirical foundation for Counsell's curriculum principles.

### Second-Order Concepts

Both Lee/Ashby and Counsell emphasise the importance of second-order concepts. Lee and Ashby's research demonstrated that progression in historical understanding involves development in understanding of these concepts; Counsell's framework organises the curriculum around the development of second-order understanding. The CHATA progression models provide the empirical basis for the curriculum structure that Counsell advocates.

### The Residue

Counsell's concept of "residue"—the lasting understanding that remains with students after the details of specific topics have been forgotten—aligns closely with Lee and Ashby's research. The CHATA project identified the forms of conceptual understanding that have lasting value: understanding of evidence, accounts, causation, and other second-order concepts. These forms of understanding constitute the residue that effective history education should leave with students.

### Assessment

Lee and Ashby's work on assessment has informed Counsell's thinking about how to assess historical understanding. Both agree that assessment should target conceptual understanding rather than merely factual recall, and that effective assessment requires tasks that probe students' application of historical concepts.

## Legacy and Continuing Influence

### The CHATA Legacy

The CHATA project established a paradigm for research into students' historical thinking that continues to influence the field. Its methodology—clinical interviewing designed to probe conceptual understanding—has been widely adopted and adapted. Its findings about how students' historical thinking develops continue to inform curriculum design and teaching.

The project's emphasis on second-order concepts has been particularly influential. The idea that history education should focus on developing conceptual understanding, not merely transmitting factual knowledge, has become widely accepted, and the specific concepts identified by the CHATA project—evidence, accounts, cause, change, empathy, and significance—have become central to history education in England and internationally.

### Ongoing Research

Lee and Ashby's work continues to inform ongoing research in history education. Researchers building on the CHATA foundations have extended the investigation of students' historical thinking to new areas, including:

- The development of historical thinking in different cultural contexts
- The relationship between historical thinking and civic education
- The role of digital technologies in supporting historical thinking
- The development of historical thinking in higher education

### Practical Impact

Perhaps most importantly, Lee and Ashby's work has had significant practical impact on history teaching. Their research has informed curriculum development, assessment design, and teacher education. Publications in *Teaching History* have reached thousands of teachers, influencing classroom practice across England and beyond.

The progression models developed through CHATA have been particularly valuable for teachers, providing diagnostic tools for understanding students' thinking and planning instruction that supports their development. Teachers who understand how students' historical thinking develops are better able to design effective teaching and assess students' understanding appropriately.

## Conclusion

Peter Lee and Rosalyn Ashby have made a contribution to history education that is difficult to overstate. Through the CHATA project and subsequent research, they have transformed our understanding of how students learn history. Their work has demonstrated that students are capable of far more sophisticated historical thinking than had previously been assumed, and has mapped how that thinking develops.

The concepts and frameworks developed through their research—second-order concepts, progression models, the distinction between first-order and second-order understanding—have become central to how we think about history education. Their influence can be seen in the National Curriculum for History, in teacher education programmes, and in classrooms across England and internationally.

Lee and Ashby's work represents a model of research-informed practice in education. Their research has been both theoretically sophisticated and practically relevant, addressing fundamental questions about the nature of historical understanding while also providing guidance for classroom practice. As history education continues to evolve, their research provides a foundation of evidence and insight that will continue to inform practice for years to come.

The ongoing relevance of their work lies in its empirical foundation. By investigating how students actually think about history, Lee and Ashby provided an evidence base that can inform practice regardless of shifts in educational policy or curriculum structure. Their legacy is not merely a body of research findings but a way of thinking about history education that values rigorous investigation, conceptual clarity, and the ultimate goal of developing students who can think historically.
