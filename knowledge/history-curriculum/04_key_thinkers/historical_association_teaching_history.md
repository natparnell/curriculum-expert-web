# The Historical Association and Teaching History: Sustaining Professional Discourse

## Introduction

The Historical Association (HA) and its flagship journal *Teaching History* constitute one of the most significant institutions in English history education. Since its foundation in 1906, the Historical Association has worked to promote the study and teaching of history at all levels, while *Teaching History*, established in 1970, has provided the primary forum for debate about history pedagogy in secondary schools. The combination of a professional membership organisation with a practitioner-focused journal has created a unique ecosystem that supports the development of history teaching in England.

Unlike academic journals that target university-based researchers, *Teaching History* has always been written by and for school teachers. Its articles address the practical challenges of classroom teaching while also engaging with theoretical and research-based perspectives on history education. This combination of practicality and intellectual rigour has made the journal essential reading for history teachers and has shaped how the profession thinks about effective practice.

This profile examines the history and development of the Historical Association, the evolution of *Teaching History*, the journal's distinctive approach to professional publishing, its role in the history education revolution of the 1970s-1990s, and its continuing influence on classroom practice.

## The Historical Association: Origins and Development

### Foundation and Early Years (1906-1960s)

The Historical Association was founded in 1906 with the aim of promoting the study and teaching of history in England. Its establishment reflected growing concern about the state of history education, particularly in schools. The Association brought together university historians, school teachers, and interested members of the public in a common enterprise of supporting historical study.

In its early decades, the Historical Association focused primarily on:

- **Supporting university history**: The Association had strong connections to academic history and worked to promote historical research and scholarship.

- **Providing resources for teachers**: Through pamphlets, publications, and local branches, the Association sought to support school history teachers with up-to-date historical scholarship.

- **Public engagement**: The Association organised lectures, excursions, and other activities to promote public interest in history.

The early years of the Historical Association were characterised by a fairly traditional view of history education, focused primarily on the transmission of established historical knowledge. The Association supported school history by ensuring teachers had access to accurate, up-to-date historical content.

### The Expansion Period (1960s-1980s)

The 1960s and 1970s saw significant expansion of the Historical Association's activities. This period coincided with major changes in education, including the move towards comprehensive schooling and the development of new approaches to history teaching.

Key developments during this period included:

- **Growth of membership**: The Association's membership grew significantly as history teaching expanded in secondary schools.

- **Development of local branches**: The branch network expanded, providing opportunities for teachers to meet, share ideas, and engage with historical scholarship.

- **Publication programme**: The Association expanded its publications, including the development of *Teaching History* as a dedicated journal for secondary history teachers.

This period also saw the beginnings of a shift in how the Association thought about history education. The Schools History Project, established in 1972, challenged traditional approaches to history teaching, and the Historical Association became a forum for debating these new ideas.

### The Modern Period (1990s-Present)

Since the 1990s, the Historical Association has continued to evolve in response to changing educational contexts. The introduction of the National Curriculum in 1991, the subsequent revisions, and the changing landscape of teacher education have all shaped the Association's activities.

Key features of the modern Historical Association include:

- **Focus on professional development**: The Association has placed increasing emphasis on supporting teachers' professional development through conferences, courses, and publications.

- **Research engagement**: While maintaining its practitioner focus, the Association has engaged more actively with research on history education, helping to translate research findings into classroom practice.

- **Policy engagement**: The Association has been active in policy debates about history education, contributing to consultations and advocating for effective history teaching.

- **Digital development**: The Association has developed online resources, including the T.E.A.C.H. platform, to support teachers' continuing professional development.

## Teaching History: The Journal

### Origins and Early Development (1970-1985)

*Teaching History* was launched in 1970 as the Historical Association's journal for secondary history teachers. Its establishment reflected recognition that secondary history teachers needed a dedicated forum for sharing ideas, discussing pedagogy, and engaging with developments in the field.

The early years of *Teaching History* coincided with the beginnings of the "New History" movement. Articles in the journal debated the purposes of history education, the relationship between content and skills, and the potential of new approaches such as the Schools History Project.

The journal's format was distinctive from the outset. Unlike academic journals that published lengthy research articles, *Teaching History* featured shorter, more accessible pieces that addressed practical classroom concerns. The journal included:

- **Practical articles**: Teachers sharing approaches that had worked in their classrooms
- **Resource reviews**: Evaluations of textbooks, source collections, and other teaching materials
- **Discussion pieces**: Debates about the purposes and methods of history teaching
- **News and updates**: Information about curriculum developments, examination changes, and Association activities

### The Golden Age (1985-2000)

The period from the mid-1980s to 2000 is often regarded as the "golden age" of *Teaching History*. During this period, the journal played a central role in the history education revolution, publishing articles by key figures such as Christine Counsell, Michael Riley, and others that articulated new approaches to history teaching.

Key developments during this period included:

- **The rise of the article essay**: Under the editorship of Christine Counsell (from 1997), the journal developed the "article essay" format—longer, more substantial pieces that combined practical classroom ideas with theoretical frameworks and research evidence.

- **Focus on second-order concepts**: Articles increasingly focused on how to teach historical thinking—how to develop students' understanding of evidence, causation, change, and other second-order concepts.

- **Curriculum development**: The journal became a forum for developing new curriculum approaches, with articles exploring how to structure schemes of work, design enquiry questions, and plan for progression.

- **Research engagement**: While remaining practitioner-focused, the journal engaged more systematically with research on history education, helping teachers to understand and apply research findings.

### Recent Developments (2000-Present)

Since 2000, *Teaching History* has continued to evolve while maintaining its core mission. The journal has adapted to new challenges, including the revised National Curriculum of 2014, changes to GCSE and A-level specifications, and the development of new technologies for teaching and learning.

Key features of the modern *Teaching History* include:

- **Continued practitioner focus**: Articles remain written by and for teachers, addressing the practical challenges of classroom history teaching.

- **Research-informed practice**: The journal continues to bridge research and practice, helping teachers to engage with research evidence and to contribute to knowledge about effective teaching.

- **Digital development**: The journal has developed digital formats and online resources to complement the print publication.

- **International engagement**: While focused on English history education, the journal has engaged with developments internationally, recognising the global nature of history education discourse.

## The Distinctive Approach of Teaching History

### Practitioner Authorship

A defining feature of *Teaching History* is that it is written primarily by practitioners—teachers writing for other teachers. While academic researchers occasionally contribute, the majority of articles are written by school history teachers sharing their classroom practice.

This practitioner authorship has several consequences:

- **Practical relevance**: Articles address real classroom concerns, not abstract theoretical questions.

- **Accessibility**: Articles are written in accessible language, avoiding the technical jargon that can characterise academic writing.

- **Credibility**: Teachers trust articles written by other teachers who face similar challenges.

- **Community building**: The journal creates a community of practice, connecting teachers who might otherwise work in isolation.

### The Article Essay Format

Under Christine Counsell's editorship, *Teaching History* developed the "article essay" as a distinctive genre. Article essays are longer than typical journal articles (often 4,000-6,000 words) and combine several elements:

- **Practical classroom ideas**: Concrete suggestions for lessons, activities, and resources that teachers can use.

- **Theoretical frameworks**: Engagement with concepts and frameworks that help teachers understand why particular approaches are effective.

- **Research evidence**: Drawing on research about student learning, historical thinking, and effective pedagogy.

- **Critical reflection**: Authors reflect on their practice, considering what worked, what didn't, and why.

The article essay format has been highly influential. It has demonstrated that practitioner writing can be intellectually rigorous while remaining accessible and practical. Many of the most influential articles in English history education have been article essays published in *Teaching History*.

### Themed Issues

*Teaching History* regularly publishes themed issues that focus on particular topics or aspects of history teaching. These themed issues allow for in-depth exploration of specific areas, bringing together multiple perspectives and approaches.

Examples of themed issues include:

- **Second-order concepts**: Issues focusing on how to teach specific second-order concepts such as causation, evidence, or change.

- **Period-focused issues**: Issues exploring approaches to teaching particular historical periods.

- **Pedagogical themes**: Issues addressing specific pedagogical approaches such as enquiry-based learning, use of ICT, or assessment.

- **Policy-focused issues**: Issues responding to curriculum changes, examination reforms, or other policy developments.

Themed issues provide depth of coverage that individual articles cannot achieve, allowing teachers to develop comprehensive understanding of particular topics.

## Key Contributions to History Education

### Disseminating the Schools History Project

*Teaching History* played a crucial role in disseminating the Schools History Project approach. Articles by SHP developers and teachers using SHP materials introduced readers to enquiry-based learning, the use of sources, and the development of historical thinking.

The journal provided a forum where teachers could share their experiences of implementing SHP approaches, learning from each other's successes and challenges. This peer-to-peer learning was essential in establishing the SHP as a mainstream approach to history teaching.

### Developing Understanding of Second-Order Concepts

*Teaching History* has been the primary forum for developing understanding of second-order concepts in history education. Articles by Peter Lee, Denis Shemilt, Rosalyn Ashby, Christine Counsell, and others have explored how students develop understanding of evidence, cause, change, and other concepts, and how teachers can support this development.

These articles have translated research findings into practical classroom guidance, helping teachers to understand what historical thinking looks like and how it can be developed. The journal has created a shared professional language for talking about historical thinking, enabling teachers to discuss and refine their practice.

### Supporting Curriculum Development

*Teaching History* has supported curriculum development by providing models of effective practice and frameworks for curriculum design. Articles exploring how to structure schemes of work, how to design enquiry questions, and how to plan for progression have helped teachers to develop more effective curricula.

The journal has been particularly influential in promoting the enquiry-based approach to curriculum design. Articles by Michael Riley and others have provided practical guidance on designing rigorous enquiry questions that engage students in genuine historical thinking.

### Advocating for History Education

Through its editorials, comment pieces, and responses to policy consultations, *Teaching History* has advocated for effective history education. The journal has consistently argued for:

- **The importance of history in the curriculum**: Defending history's place as a core subject and arguing for sufficient curriculum time.

- **The value of rigorous historical thinking**: Promoting approaches that develop students' capacity to think historically, not merely to memorise facts.

- **The need for teacher professionalism**: Supporting teachers' professional judgment and opposing approaches that reduce teaching to following scripts.

- **The importance of continued professional development**: Encouraging teachers to engage with research, reflect on their practice, and continue developing their expertise.

## The Editorial Tradition

### Christine Counsell's Editorship (1997-2003)

Christine Counsell's editorship of *Teaching History* from 1997 to 2003 was transformative. Under her leadership, the journal developed the article essay format and established its distinctive combination of practicality and intellectual rigour.

Counsell's approach was characterised by:

- **High standards**: Articles were rigorously edited to ensure clarity, coherence, and intellectual substance.

- **Attention to language**: Counsell worked with authors to develop precise, elegant prose that conveyed complex ideas accessibly.

- **Bridging theory and practice**: Articles were expected to engage with theoretical frameworks and research evidence while remaining grounded in classroom practice.

- **Developing authors**: Counsell worked extensively with authors, particularly new writers, to develop their ideas and their writing.

The quality of *Teaching History* under Counsell's editorship established it as the leading journal for history education, not only in England but internationally.

### Subsequent Editorships

Following Counsell, *Teaching History* has been edited by a succession of distinguished history educators, each bringing their own perspectives while maintaining the journal's core mission. The editorial tradition has ensured continuity while also allowing the journal to evolve in response to new challenges and opportunities.

The journal has benefited from editors who are themselves experienced classroom teachers and teacher educators, ensuring that editorial decisions are informed by practical understanding of what teachers need.

## Relationship to Other Key Figures and Institutions

### Connection to the Schools History Project

The Historical Association and *Teaching History* have maintained close connections to the Schools History Project since its inception. The journal has been the primary forum for sharing SHP ideas and for debate about the SHP approach.

Many key SHP figures have published regularly in *Teaching History*, including Denis Shemilt, Michael Riley, and Ian Dawson. The journal has also published articles by teachers using SHP materials, sharing their classroom experiences and innovations.

### Connection to Academic Research

While *Teaching History* is a practitioner journal, it has maintained connections to academic research on history education. Researchers such as Peter Lee, Rosalyn Ashby, and Denis Shemilt have published in the journal, translating their research findings for a practitioner audience.

The journal has also published articles that engage with academic research, helping teachers to understand and apply research evidence. This has created a two-way relationship: researchers share their findings with teachers, and teachers contribute their practical knowledge to the research community.

### Connection to Policy

The Historical Association and *Teaching History* have engaged with policy development, responding to curriculum consultations and contributing to debates about history education. The Association's policy work is informed by its understanding of classroom practice and by the ideas developed in the journal.

This policy engagement has been particularly important during periods of curriculum reform, such as the introduction of the National Curriculum in 1991 and its subsequent revisions. The Association has advocated for curricula that support rigorous historical thinking and that respect teachers' professional judgment.

## Criticism and Debate

### Questions of Representation

Critics have raised questions about whose voices are represented in *Teaching History*. The journal has historically reflected the perspectives of established history teachers, and some have argued that it has not sufficiently represented the perspectives of new teachers, teachers in challenging contexts, or teachers from diverse backgrounds.

The journal has responded to these criticisms by seeking to broaden its authorship and to address issues of diversity and inclusion. However, the challenge of representing the full diversity of the profession remains.

### The Tension Between Research and Practice

*Teaching History* operates in the space between research and practice, and this positioning creates tensions. Some researchers have argued that the journal oversimplifies research findings in making them accessible to practitioners. Some practitioners have found the journal's engagement with theory and research to be insufficiently practical.

The journal has navigated these tensions by maintaining high standards for both practical relevance and intellectual substance. Article essays are expected to be both grounded in classroom practice and informed by research and theory.

### The Question of Innovation

Some critics have argued that *Teaching History* has become somewhat conservative, publishing articles that refine established approaches rather than proposing radical innovations. The journal's focus on evidence-based practice and its commitment to rigorous standards may, it is suggested, limit space for experimentation and risk-taking.

Defenders of the journal argue that its role is to develop and disseminate established good practice rather than to promote untested innovations. The journal provides a stable foundation of effective approaches that teachers can rely on, even as it also engages with new developments.

## Legacy and Continuing Influence
