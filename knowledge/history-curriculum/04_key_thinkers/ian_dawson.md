# Ian Dawson: Making History Accessible through Narrative and Enquiry

## Introduction

Ian Dawson stands as one of the most influential figures in history education, particularly in the development of engaging, narrative-driven textbooks that bring the past to life for young people. His work as a textbook author, curriculum developer, and advocate for the Schools History Project (SHP) approach has shaped how generations of students have encountered history. Unlike academic researchers who focus primarily on theoretical frameworks, Dawson's contribution has been distinguished by his ability to craft compelling historical narratives that maintain rigorous disciplinary standards while remaining accessible to students of all abilities.

Dawson's textbooks, including the seminal *Medieval Realms* series for the Schools History Project, have been used by millions of students across the United Kingdom and internationally. His distinctive approach combines narrative storytelling with enquiry-based learning, demonstrating that rigorous historical thinking need not come at the expense of engaging, readable content. This balance between accessibility and intellectual rigour has made his work particularly valuable in comprehensive schools serving diverse student populations.

This profile examines Dawson's career trajectory, his contributions to SHP textbook development, his narrative approach to history writing, his work on enquiry-based learning, and his influence on classroom practice. It also explores his relationship to other key figures in history education and the enduring popularity of his textbooks among teachers and students.

## Early Career and Formation

### Background and Teaching Experience

Ian Dawson began his career as a history teacher in comprehensive schools during the 1970s and 1980s. This practical classroom experience provided the foundation for his subsequent work as a textbook author and curriculum developer. Teaching in mixed-ability comprehensive schools during this period gave Dawson first-hand understanding of the challenges facing history teachers: how to make history accessible to all students while maintaining intellectual challenge; how to engage students who might not initially see the relevance of the past; how to balance content coverage with the development of historical thinking.

The comprehensive school context was significant for Dawson's development. The movement towards comprehensive education in England from the 1960s brought students of all abilities into the same classrooms, challenging the elitist assumptions that had characterised much history teaching. Dawson's work emerged from this context; his textbooks were designed for the comprehensive classroom, providing access to rigorous history for students who might previously have been excluded.

### Connection to the Schools History Project

Dawson's work became closely associated with the Schools History Project (SHP) from its early days. The SHP, established in 1972 under the leadership of David Sylvester, sought to transform history teaching by emphasising enquiry-based learning, engagement with primary sources, and the development of historical thinking. Dawson's approach aligned naturally with the SHP philosophy, and he became one of the project's most prolific and influential authors.

The SHP provided Dawson with a framework for his textbook writing. The project's emphasis on enquiry questions, on engaging with historical evidence, and on understanding historical concepts shaped how he structured his narratives. At the same time, Dawson's textbooks helped to disseminate the SHP approach to schools across England, providing practical resources that teachers could use to implement enquiry-based history teaching.

## The Medieval Realms Series

### Development and Impact

Dawson's most influential work is the *Medieval Realms* series, published by John Murray for the Schools History Project. First published in the 1980s and subsequently revised, these textbooks became the standard resource for teaching medieval history at Key Stage 3. The series covered the period from 1066 to 1500, providing comprehensive coverage of medieval English history while maintaining the SHP emphasis on enquiry and historical thinking.

The impact of the *Medieval Realms* series has been substantial. Over three decades, millions of students have used these textbooks to learn about the Norman Conquest, medieval society, the Black Death, the Peasants' Revolt, and other key topics. The textbooks have shaped how several generations of students understand the medieval period, establishing narratives and interpretations that have become widely familiar.

### Narrative Approach

Dawson's distinctive contribution in the *Medieval Realms* series was his narrative approach to history writing. Unlike traditional textbooks that presented history as a series of discrete facts to be memorised, Dawson crafted engaging narratives that brought the past to life. Students encountered historical actors as individuals with motivations and dilemmas, not merely as names to be recalled.

This narrative approach served multiple purposes:

- **Engagement**: Stories engage students' interest in ways that lists of facts do not. Dawson's narratives drew students into the past, making them want to know what happened next.

- **Understanding**: Narrative helps students understand how events unfolded, how one thing led to another, and how historical actors made choices within constraints.

- **Retention**: Information embedded in narrative is more memorable than isolated facts. Students who read Dawson's narratives retained more than those who studied traditional textbooks.

- **Accessibility**: Narrative makes history accessible to students of all abilities. The narrative form is familiar from fiction and everyday experience, providing a scaffold for understanding historical content.

### Integration of Enquiry

While the *Medieval Realms* series is notable for its narrative quality, it also maintained the SHP commitment to enquiry-based learning. Each unit was structured around enquiry questions that required students to engage with historical evidence and to think historically. The narrative provided the context and motivation for enquiry; the enquiry questions required students to analyse, evaluate, and reach substantiated conclusions.

This integration of narrative and enquiry was distinctive. Some critics of narrative history teaching worried that it would lead to passive consumption of stories rather than active historical thinking. Dawson's textbooks demonstrated that narrative and enquiry could be combined, with narrative providing the foundation for rigorous historical investigation.

## Other Textbook Contributions

### The SHP Standard Series

Beyond *Medieval Realms*, Dawson contributed to other titles in the John Murray SHP series. These included textbooks covering different periods of British history, all sharing the distinctive Dawson approach: engaging narrative combined with enquiry-based activities. The SHP series provided comprehensive coverage of the Key Stage 3 history curriculum, with Dawson's contributions helping to establish the series as the leading resource for history teaching in England.

The SHP textbooks were notable for their attention to visual sources. Dawson incorporated paintings, photographs, artefacts, and maps into his narratives, teaching students to read visual evidence alongside written texts. This multimodal approach recognised that historical understanding involves engagement with diverse source types, not merely written documents.

### Modern World History

Dawson also contributed to textbooks for modern world history, including resources for GCSE and A-level students. These textbooks extended his narrative approach to topics such as the World Wars, the Cold War, and the rise and fall of empires. The modern world textbooks maintained the commitment to accessibility and engagement while addressing the more demanding content required for examination courses.

### International Impact

Dawson's textbooks have had international impact, being used in schools across the English-speaking world and in international schools globally. The accessibility of his narrative approach, combined with rigorous attention to historical thinking, made his textbooks attractive to educators in diverse contexts. Teachers in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and elsewhere have used Dawson's resources to implement enquiry-based history teaching.

## Pedagogical Approach

### Making History Accessible

A central theme of Dawson's work has been making history accessible to all students. This commitment emerged from his experience teaching in comprehensive schools and from his belief that history is a subject that should be available to everyone, not merely an elite.

Dawson's approach to accessibility involves:

- **Clear, engaging prose**: Dawson writes with clarity and verve, avoiding the convoluted sentences and technical vocabulary that can make academic history inaccessible to young readers.

- **Narrative structure**: The narrative form provides a familiar structure that supports comprehension. Students know how stories work, and this knowledge scaffolds their understanding of historical content.

- **Gradual complexity**: Dawson introduces complexity gradually, building students' understanding over time rather than overwhelming them with detail at the outset.

- **Relatable characters**: Historical actors are presented as individuals with motivations and dilemmas that students can understand, making the past feel human and relevant.

### Maintaining Rigor

While committed to accessibility, Dawson has never sacrificed historical rigour. His textbooks are meticulously researched, drawing on up-to-date historical scholarship. The narratives he crafts are historically accurate, avoiding the simplifications and distortions that can characterise popular history.

This balance between accessibility and rigour is achieved through:

- **Scholarly foundations**: Dawson's narratives are based on thorough engagement with historical scholarship, ensuring that the content reflects current historical understanding.

- **Source-based enquiry**: The integration of primary sources ensures that students engage with historical evidence, not merely with pre-digested narratives.

- **Attention to controversy**: Dawson presents history as contested, introducing students to debates among historians and encouraging them to evaluate different interpretations.

- **Development of historical thinking**: The enquiry questions and activities develop students' capacity to think historically, not merely to consume narratives.

### The Role of Imagination

Dawson's work recognises the role of imagination in historical understanding. To understand the past, students need to be able to imagine different worlds, different ways of thinking, different circumstances. The narrative form engages the imagination in ways that more abstract presentation cannot.

At the same time, Dawson's approach maintains the distinction between historical imagination and fiction. While engaging students' imaginations, his textbooks maintain the evidential basis of historical claims. Students are taught to ground their understanding in evidence, not merely to speculate imaginatively.

## Influence on History Education

### Shaping Classroom Practice

Dawson's textbooks have shaped classroom practice in thousands of schools. Teachers have used his resources as the foundation for their lessons, adopting his narratives, his enquiry questions, and his approach to historical sources. The widespread use of his textbooks has created a degree of consistency in how history is taught across England, with generations of students encountering similar narratives and similar approaches to historical thinking.

This influence extends beyond the textbooks themselves. Dawson's approach has informed how other authors write history textbooks and how teachers design their own resources. The combination of narrative and enquiry that characterises his work has become a model for history education materials.

### Supporting the SHP Approach

Dawson's textbooks have been crucial in supporting the Schools History Project approach. The SHP's emphasis on enquiry-based learning, on engagement with sources, and on the development of historical thinking requires resources that teachers can use in the classroom. Dawson's textbooks provided these resources, making the SHP approach practicable for teachers across England.

Without practical resources, innovative approaches to teaching risk remaining theoretical. Dawson's work translated the SHP philosophy into classroom practice, enabling teachers to implement enquiry-based history teaching with their students. This practical contribution was as important as the theoretical frameworks developed by academic researchers.

### Influencing Curriculum Development

Dawson's work has influenced curriculum development beyond the SHP. The National Curriculum for History, introduced in 1991 and subsequently revised, drew on the approaches that Dawson's textbooks exemplified. The emphasis on engaging with historical sources, on understanding historical concepts, and on reaching substantiated conclusions reflected the pedagogy that Dawson had been developing through his textbooks.

The narrative approach has also influenced how the curriculum is structured. The recognition that students need to understand the broad outlines of historical periods, to have a sense of how events unfolded, owes something to the narrative tradition that Dawson represents. While the National Curriculum has moved away from prescribing specific content, the importance of coherent historical narratives remains recognised.

## Relationship to Other Key Thinkers

### Connection to Denis Shemilt and the SHP

Dawson's work is deeply connected to the Schools History Project and to Denis Shemilt's evaluation and development of the project. Shemilt's research demonstrated that enquiry-based approaches could develop students' historical understanding; Dawson's textbooks provided the resources that enabled teachers to implement these approaches.

The relationship between Dawson and the academic researchers associated with the SHP illustrates the complementary nature of different contributions to history education. Academic researchers generate evidence and theoretical frameworks; textbook authors translate these into practical resources. Both are necessary for effective educational improvement.

### Connection to Michael Riley

Dawson's narrative approach connects to Michael Riley's work on enquiry questions. While Riley focused particularly on the design of rigorous enquiry questions, Dawson focused on the narratives that provide context for enquiry. Both share a commitment to engaging students in genuine historical thinking, and both recognise the importance of accessibility alongside rigour.

Dawson's work exemplifies the approach that Riley advocates in his "History Garden" article. The textbooks provide "plants" for the garden—resources that teachers can select and arrange according to their own curriculum design. Dawson's narratives are not meant to be passively consumed but to be engaged with critically through enquiry.

### Connection to Christine Counsell

Dawson's work aligns with Christine Counsell's curriculum framework in its emphasis on rigorous historical thinking and its recognition of the importance of coherent narratives. Counsell's concept of the "residue" of history education—the lasting understanding that remains with students—connects to Dawson's concern with narratives that students will remember and that will shape their understanding of the past.

Both Dawson and Counsell recognise that history education must balance content coverage with the development of disciplinary understanding. Dawson's textbooks provide the content coverage while also developing students' capacity to think historically. The integration of narrative and enquiry exemplifies the balanced approach that Counsell advocates.

## Criticism and Debate

### The Narrative Debate

Dawson's narrative approach has not been without criticism. Some educators have worried that narrative history teaching leads to passive consumption rather than active critical engagement. The concern is that students may absorb the stories without questioning them, developing a naive view of history as a fixed sequence of events rather than a contested interpretation.

Dawson's response to this criticism lies in the integration of narrative with enquiry. His textbooks do not present narratives to be memorised but stories to be investigated. The enquiry questions require students to engage critically with the narratives, to evaluate evidence, and to consider alternative interpretations. The narrative provides the motivation and context for enquiry; the enquiry develops the critical thinking that the critics of narrative advocate.

### Representation and Perspective

Critics have also raised questions about whose stories are told in history textbooks. The traditional focus on political and military history, on the actions of elites, has been challenged by social historians who argue for greater attention to the experiences of ordinary people, of women, of marginalised groups.

Dawson's textbooks have evolved in response to these criticisms. Later editions have incorporated greater attention to social history, to the experiences of ordinary people, and to diverse perspectives. The narrative form is adaptable; it can tell the stories of peasants as well as kings, of women as well as men, of colonised peoples as well as colonisers.

### The Question of Interpretation

A more fundamental question concerns the status of historical narratives. Are they representations of what happened, or are they constructions that reflect the perspectives and purposes of their authors? Postmodern critiques of historical knowledge have questioned the possibility of objective historical representation, suggesting that all narratives are equally constructed.

Dawson's approach to this question is pragmatic. His narratives are based on evidence and reflect current historical scholarship. They are presented as interpretations that can be evaluated, not as fixed truths. The enquiry questions encourage students to engage critically with the narratives, to consider alternative interpretations, and to recognise that history involves ongoing debate.

## Legacy and Continuing Relevance

### Enduring Popularity

Dawson's textbooks have remained popular with teachers and students over several decades. This longevity is unusual in educational publishing, where textbooks often date quickly as curricula change and new research emerges. The enduring popularity of Dawson's work testifies to its quality and to its continuing relevance to classroom practice.

Teachers continue to use Dawson's textbooks because they work. Students engage with the narratives, understand the content, and develop their historical thinking. In a period when educational policy has been volatile, with frequent curriculum changes, Dawson's textbooks have provided a stable foundation that teachers can rely on.

### Influence on New Generations

Dawson's influence extends to new generations of history teachers who themselves used his textbooks as students. Many current history teachers encountered Dawson's narratives when they were at school, and this experience shaped their understanding of what history teaching can be. When they became teachers themselves, they naturally turned to resources that had inspired their own interest in history.

This generational transmission of influence is significant. Dawson's approach has become part of the culture of history teaching in England, taken for granted by teachers who may not explicitly recognise its origins. The narrative-enquiry model that Dawson pioneered has become the default approach for many history educators.

### Adaptation to New Contexts

While the original *Medieval Realms* series was designed for the Key Stage 3 curriculum of the 1980s and 1990s, Dawson's work has been adapted to new contexts as the curriculum has evolved. The principles that underlie his approach—engaging narrative, rigorous enquiry, accessibility combined with intellectual challenge—remain relevant even as the specific content requirements have changed.

Digital technologies have created new possibilities for presenting historical narratives and for engaging students in enquiry. While Dawson's original textbooks were print-based, the principles they exemplify can be realised in digital formats. The narrative-enquiry model is adaptable to new technologies and new pedagogical contexts.

## Conclusion

Ian Dawson's contribution to history education is difficult to overstate. Through his textbooks, particularly the *Medieval Realms* series, he has shaped how millions of students have encountered the past. His distinctive combination of engaging narrative and rigorous enquiry demonstrated that history education could be both accessible and intellectually challenging, a subject available to all students in comprehensive schools.

Dawson's work exemplifies the practical craft of history teaching. While academic researchers generate theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence, textbook authors like Dawson translate these into resources that teachers can use. This practical contribution is essential; without it, innovative approaches to teaching would remain theoretical ideals rather than classroom realities.

The influence of Dawson's work extends through the generations of students who have used his textbooks and the teachers who have been inspired by his approach. His narratives have become part of how English students understand their past, shaping collective historical consciousness in subtle but significant ways.

As history education continues to evolve, Dawson's work provides a foundation of principled practice. The balance between narrative and enquiry, between accessibility and rigour, between engagement and critical thinking remains the challenge for history educators. Dawson's textbooks demonstrate that these balances can be achieved, providing a model for future curriculum development and resource creation.
