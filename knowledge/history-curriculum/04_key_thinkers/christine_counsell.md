## Biography

Christine Counsell is one of the most influential figures in British history education, whose work has shaped curriculum thinking and policy both in the UK and internationally. Her career spans classroom teaching, teacher education, policy advice, and curriculum design.

### Early Career and Teaching (1980s-1990s)

Counsell studied history at the University of Edinburgh before training as a teacher in Cardiff. She taught history in comprehensive schools in her home county of Gloucestershire, followed by teaching and leadership positions in Bristol. During this period, she held the position of Head of History at Cirencester Deer Park School.

Following her classroom teaching, she became Local Authority Adviser for history in primary and secondary schools in Gloucestershire. This experience gave her deep insight into the full range of school contexts, from primary through secondary, and shaped her understanding of the challenges facing teachers across different settings.

### Cambridge Faculty of Education (1997-2016)

In 1997, Counsell joined the University of Cambridge Faculty of Education, where she led the history PGCE course for 19 years. During this period, she:

- Trained experienced teachers as curriculum theorists and research-literate professionals
- Shaped the thinking of a generation of history teachers and teacher educators
- Received the University of Cambridge **Pilkington Prize** in 2006 for outstanding teaching excellence
- Was made a **Centenary Fellow** by the Historical Association in 2006, for outstanding services to the promotion of the study of history

Her work at Cambridge established her reputation as someone who could bridge the gap between academic scholarship and classroom practice, bringing rigorous disciplinary thinking to teacher development.

### Inspiration Trust (2016-2023)

In 2016, Counsell relocated to Norfolk with her husband (an orchestra conductor) to become **Director of Education** at the Inspiration Trust, a multi-academy trust serving schools in areas of deprivation in East Anglia. At Inspiration Trust, she:

- Introduced a knowledge-rich primary curriculum across the trust's schools
- Established subject communities in secondary subjects for collaborative curriculum design
- Founded a new SCITT (School-Centered Initial Teacher Training) for the region
- Integrated curriculum, teaching and learning, and teacher training in a holistic approach

This role allowed her to "pull various strands together that don't often get pulled together: curriculum, teaching and learning, teacher training." She left the Trust in March 2023 to become an independent consultant.

### Current Work (2023-present)

Counsell now works internationally as an independent consultant on curriculum and teacher development. Current roles include:

- **Chair of the Curriculum Taskforce** for Northern Ireland (since October 2025), overseeing the introduction of a new curriculum across all subjects
- **Trustee** of the David Ross Education Trust
- Curriculum consultant to governments including the Ministry of Education in Singapore, the Flemish government (where she served on a 2025 commission overseeing major curriculum reform), and the Australian Curriculum and Assessment Reporting Authority
- Expertise in teaching history in post-conflict zones, notably Cyprus and Lebanon

## Key Ideas

### 1. The Substantive-Disciplinary Knowledge Distinction

Counsell is best known for articulating and developing the distinction between **substantive knowledge** and **disciplinary knowledge**—a framework that has become central to history education and is increasingly influential across other subjects.

**Substantive knowledge** is "the content that teachers teach as established fact—whether common convention, concept or warranted account of reality." This includes specific events, dates, concepts, and narratives—the "givens" of a subject.

**Disciplinary knowledge**, by contrast, is "a curricular term for what pupils learn about how that knowledge was established, its degree of certainty and how it continues to be revised by scholars, artists or professional practice." It is the understanding of each discipline as "a tradition of enquiry with its own distinctive pursuit of truth."

Counsell argues that this distinction matters because:
- It helps pupils understand that "what I teach is not all that there is"
- In subjects like history, it enables pupils to see that even the selection and juxtaposition of facts in a narrative amount to an interpretation
- It provides the conceptual tools for senior leaders to evaluate teaching and assessment appropriately—recognising, for example, that "a paired discussion designed to practise a facet of open argument derived from a particular discipline" is fundamentally different from "a paired discussion designed for learning substantive content"

This framework has been widely adopted in Ofsted's curriculum reviews and has influenced the language used in the National Curriculum and GCSE specifications.

### 2. The "Residue" Concept

Central to Counsell's thinking is the concept of **"residue"**—the accumulated, lasting knowledge that shapes pupils' future understanding. She argues that the purpose of curriculum is to build this residue: the knowledge that "flavours" subsequent learning and enables pupils to engage with increasingly complex material.

This connects to her argument that "the curriculum is the progression model"—that progression is not about generic skills but about the accumulation of increasingly sophisticated knowledge. The "residue" concept emphasises that knowledge must be **memorable** and **meaningful** if it is to serve as the foundation for future learning.

### 3. Knowledge-Rich Curriculum

Counsell is a leading advocate for **knowledge-rich curriculum**, though she dismisses simplistic "knowledge vs. skills" dichotomies as "just nonsense." Her vision of knowledge is "expansive" and "actually embraces the notion of skills."

Key elements of her approach:
- **"Knowledge is sticky"** (drawing on E.D. Hirsch's psychology of background knowledge): pupils need broad background knowledge to understand new material
- **The "hinterland"**: every subject has a "core" knowledge but also a crucial "hinterland" of stories, illustrations, examples, and richness that makes the core meaningful
- **Breadth before tests**: her "slogan" for managing accountability demands is "broaden the curriculum in order to do well in the tests"
- **The indirect manifestation of knowledge**: she argues that "the way in which curriculum works is through the indirect manifestation of knowledge"—not direct drilling for exams but rich, sequenced knowledge that enables success indirectly

### 4. Historical Significance: The 5 Rs

Counsell developed an influential framework for teaching historical significance, known as the **5 Rs**:

1. **Remarkable** – was it notable at the time and/or since?
2. **Remembered** – is it important in the collective memory of a group or groups?
3. **Resulted in change** – did it shape the future?
4. **Resonant** – does it carry meaning for later generations or different contexts?
5. **Revealing** – does it reveal something important about the past?

This framework, introduced in her 2004 *Teaching History* article "Looking through a Josephine-Butler-shaped window," has been widely adopted in classrooms internationally.

### 5. Disciplinary Argument and Writing

From her ground-breaking 1997 pamphlet *Analytical and Discursive Writing* onwards, Counsell has argued that analytical writing in history should not be avoided because it is difficult, but rather that "those very difficulties should be the focus of continuous professional analysis by all history teachers."

She emphasises that history teaching "often goes wrong if we plunge into getting children to have an argument about something and they don't know enough"—linking disciplinary practice to secure substantive knowledge.

## Influence on National Curriculum and Policy

### National Curriculum Revisions (1990s-2010s)

Counsell has been involved with **all the curriculum reviews since the 1990s** and has helped to embed innovative approaches to young people's learning. Her influence can be traced through:

- **The 2013 National Curriculum:** Along with Katie Hall, she published a critical analysis of the draft history curriculum in *Teaching History*, arguing that the proposed framework failed to build knowledge effectively. This intervention contributed to ongoing debates about curriculum design.
- **The concept of "historical knowledge" vs. "historical skill":** Her early critiques of the distracting dichotomy between knowledge and skills influenced how the National Curriculum was reconceptualised.
- **Progression frameworks:** Her work on progression as the accumulation of knowledge rather than the development of generic skills has influenced how curriculum is conceived.

### Ofsted and Assessment

Counsell has frequently advised Ofsted and the Department for Education. Her influence includes:

- The language of **substantive** and **disciplinary knowledge** now appears in Ofsted subject reviews
- Her critique of National Curriculum levels and generic assessment practices influenced the move away from levels after 2014
- The phrase **"the curriculum is the progression model"**—widely associated with her thinking—has become a touchstone for curriculum reformers

### International Influence

- **Singapore:** Regular training for the Ministry of Education
- **Cyprus:** Advisor to the Association for Historical Dialogue and Research, working on history teaching in post-conflict contexts
- **Lebanon:** Developed expertise in teaching history after conflict
- **Flanders (Belgium):** 2025 commission member for curriculum reform
- **Australia:** Advisor to the Australian Curriculum and Assessment Reporting Authority
- **New Zealand:** Consulted on knowledge-rich curriculum design
- **Northern Ireland:** Currently chairing the Curriculum Taskforce overseeing the introduction of a new curriculum in all subjects

### The Oracy Education Commission (2024)

Counsell served as a commissioner on the Oracy Education Commission, whose 2024 report laid foundations for new approaches to oracy across the curriculum in England's schools.

## Influence on the Historical Association

Counsell's relationship with the HA has been mutually formative:

### As Editor of *Teaching History*

Counsell has served as **editor of *Teaching History*** at various points in her career, supporting contributors and guiding other editors. Under her editorship, the journal has maintained its position as the leading international journal for history teachers, combining scholarly rigour with classroom practicality.

### As Centenary Fellow (2006)

Made a Centenary Fellow "for outstanding services to the promotion of the study of history"—one of the HA's highest honours, recognising her contributions to history education.

### As Medlicott Medal Winner (2025)

The HA's highest honour, awarded for services to history. The citation noted that "throughout her career she has been a champion for history as a discipline and as a way for all people to understand the world around them."

Rebecca Sullivan, CEO of the HA, stated: "She brings together so many of the threads that are important to the HA—scholarship, expertise, dedication and passion—all in the name of history and history education. Christine embodies so much of what the HA stands for."

### Influence on HA Publications and Resources

Counsell's pamphlets and articles for the HA have been among their most downloaded resources, shaping teacher thinking for decades. Her 1997 *Analytical and Discursive Writing* remains a foundational text for history departments.

## Pedagogical Approach

### Against Genericism

Counsell is a persistent critic of "genericism"—the application of generic teaching and learning strategies without attention to subject specificity. She argues:

- "You're in a disaster zone if you start trying to have a homogenous approach to teaching and learning"
- Pedagogy and curriculum cannot be separated: "how you teach is necessarily different for each subject"
- Direct instruction works well in some contexts (catch-up literacy, basic mathematics) but "would not be very helpful at all for teaching secondary school history"

### History-Specific Pedagogy

For history specifically, she advocates:

- **Problematising concepts:** getting pupils to understand how words like "empire" are used and how "slippery and interesting" they are
- **Argumentation as method:** history is a subject where pupils can legitimately produce different conclusions from the same evidence
- **The interplay of substantive and disciplinary:** neither can exist without the other—argument requires knowledge, and knowledge becomes meaningful through argument

### Critique of Fads

Counsell is willing to critique practices even when they are associated with her own "knowledge-rich" approach:

- **Knowledge organisers:** "I would call knowledge organisers a fad... they're about one per cent of the business of thinking about knowledge." She warns they can confuse "the core and the periphery" and turn learning into "something quite arid and dry"
- **Teaching to the test:** "They need to do those things because they're wonderful in their own right, and that's what primary education should be all about; understanding the world"
- **Rigid direct instruction:** inappropriate for subjects where interpretation is central

---

## Intellectual Influences

Counsell draws on diverse intellectual traditions:

- **E.D. Hirsch:** His psychology of background knowledge and the idea that "knowledge is sticky"—though she distances herself from Hirsch's cultural literacy lists
- **Michael Young:** The sociology of knowledge and the concept of "powerful knowledge"—knowledge that "escapes its origins; it's there for everybody"
- **Lee and Shemilt:** History education research on progression in historical thinking
- **Continental philosophy:** The "dignity of the thing" (from Heidegger via her blog title)—respect for the integrity of disciplinary knowledge
