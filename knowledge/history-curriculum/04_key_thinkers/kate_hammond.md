# Kate Hammond

**Biographical Summary**
Kate Hammond is a history teacher, curriculum leader, and influential writer on history pedagogy whose work has significantly shaped understandings of how historical knowledge functions in student learning and assessment. As a Head of History in Cambridgeshire and a regular contributor to the Historical Association's journal *Teaching History*, Hammond has developed conceptual frameworks that help teachers distinguish between different types and qualities of historical knowledge. Her most influential contribution, the 'three scales' of historical knowledge, provides a taxonomy that distinguishes between knowledge that merely satisfies assessment criteria and knowledge that enables genuinely sophisticated historical thinking. Hammond's work exemplifies the practitioner-researcher tradition in history education, grounding theoretical insights in close observation of classroom practice and student work.

## Academic and Professional Background

### Early Career and Teaching Context

Kate Hammond developed her teaching career in comprehensive schools in Cambridgeshire, working with students across the full ability range and developing particular expertise in Key Stage 3 and GCSE history. Like many influential history educators, Hammond's intellectual formation occurred through the practical challenges of daily classroom teaching rather than through formal academic research programmes. Her writing consistently demonstrates deep engagement with the specific problems that history teachers encounter: How do we help students develop genuine historical understanding? What distinguishes superficially successful work from genuinely sophisticated historical thinking? How can we assess student progress in ways that support rather than constrain learning?

Hammond's position as Head of History provided her with both the autonomy and the responsibility to develop curriculum sequences that embodied her developing understanding of historical learning. Her articles in *Teaching History* typically emerge from sustained experimentation with particular teaching approaches, documented through close analysis of student work and refined through cycles of implementation and reflection.

### Contribution to Professional Discourse

Hammond has been a regular contributor to *Teaching History* since the late 1990s, publishing articles that address fundamental questions about the relationship between knowledge, thinking, and assessment in history education. Her work sits within a broader tradition of practitioner research associated with the Historical Association and the Schools History Project (SHP), characterised by:

- Close attention to student work as evidence of learning
- Willingness to question received wisdom about assessment and progression
- Commitment to developing conceptual frameworks that help teachers diagnose and address learning problems
- Grounding of theoretical insights in practical classroom innovation

Hammond's writing style is characterised by intellectual honesty and a willingness to acknowledge complexity. She does not offer simple solutions or ready-to-use resources; rather, she provides conceptual tools that help teachers think more clearly about the challenges they face.

## The Three Scales of Historical Knowledge

### Origins of the Framework

Hammond's most significant contribution to history education theory emerged from a practical problem: the gap she observed between students who achieved high marks in GCSE history examinations and those whose work demonstrated genuine historical sophistication. In her seminal 2014 article 'The knowledge that "flavours" a claim: towards building and assessing historical knowledge on three scales', Hammond describes how marking Year 11 essays led her to question the relationship between assessment success and genuine historical understanding.

Some students, Hammond observed, achieved high marks through performances that were 'superficially high, but somehow fragile'. They could deploy the linguistic markers of historical analysis—causal language, evaluative vocabulary, references to evidence—but their arguments lacked the substance that would make them genuinely convincing to a historian. Other students, sometimes achieving lower marks in conventional assessment terms, demonstrated a fluency and security in their historical thinking that suggested deeper understanding.

This observation led Hammond to investigate what she called 'the true nature of their historical accomplishment'. She sought to classify 'the types of historical knowledge that seemed to help certain students not only to gain high marks but to do so with a fluency and security that marked them out from the rest'.

### The Three Scales Defined

Hammond's analysis led her to distinguish between three scales or types of historical knowledge, each serving different functions in historical thinking and argumentation:

**First-Scale Knowledge: Foundational Facts**

First-scale knowledge consists of the basic factual information that provides the raw material for historical study: dates, names, events, definitions. This is the knowledge that students typically acquire through reading, note-taking, and memorisation. While essential, Hammond argues that first-scale knowledge alone is insufficient for genuine historical thinking. A student may know that the Battle of Hastings occurred in 1066, that William of Normandy defeated Harold Godwinson, and that this led to the Norman Conquest without being able to construct a historically sophisticated argument about why William won or what the consequences were for English society.

First-scale knowledge is necessary but not sufficient. It provides the building blocks of historical understanding but does not itself constitute that understanding. Hammond's framework helps teachers recognise when students have acquired first-scale knowledge without the other scales that would enable them to use it effectively.

**Second-Scale Knowledge: Framework Knowledge**

Second-scale knowledge comprises the organising concepts, frameworks, and patterns that allow historians to make sense of factual information. This includes knowledge of:

- **Causal frameworks**: Understanding of different types of causes (long-term/short-term, underlying/trigger) and how they interact
- **Change and continuity**: Knowledge of how to identify and evaluate patterns of change over time
- **Historical significance**: Understanding of the criteria by which historians judge the importance of events
- **Interpretive frameworks**: Knowledge of how different historians approach the same evidence

Second-scale knowledge enables students to organise and deploy first-scale knowledge in meaningful ways. A student with second-scale knowledge understands not just what happened in 1066, but how to construct a causal argument about why the Normans succeeded, how to evaluate the extent of change brought by the Conquest, and how different historians have interpreted these events.

Hammond argues that much teaching and assessment focuses on second-scale knowledge without recognising that a third scale is necessary for genuinely sophisticated historical thinking.

**Third-Scale Knowledge: The Knowledge that 'Flavours' Claims**

Third-scale knowledge is Hammond's most original conceptual contribution. This is the rich, contextual, substantive knowledge that gives historical arguments their particular character and conviction. Hammond describes this as the knowledge that 'flavours' a claim—it is not the structure of the argument (second scale) or the basic facts (first scale), but the specific, detailed, contextual understanding that makes an argument historically convincing.

Third-scale knowledge includes:

- **Specific detail about context**: Understanding of the particular circumstances, constraints, and possibilities that shaped historical actors' choices
- **Knowledge of how things worked**: Understanding of institutions, social structures, economic systems, and how they operated in specific times and places
- **Awareness of the texture of past societies**: Knowledge of beliefs, values, practices, and experiences that shaped how people thought and acted
- **Understanding of particular historical situations**: Rich knowledge of specific events, decisions, and developments that goes beyond basic factual recall

Hammond's crucial insight is that third-scale knowledge is what distinguishes genuinely sophisticated historical argument from generic historical performance. Two students may construct structurally similar causal arguments about why William won at Hastings (demonstrating second-scale knowledge), but the student with third-scale knowledge will construct an argument that is historically specific, textured, and convincing. They will understand not just that Harold was tired after marching from Stamford Bridge, but how the specific geography of northern England shaped military possibilities, how the composition of the English and Norman armies affected their tactical options, and how the political pressures on both leaders influenced their decisions.

### Implications for Teaching and Assessment

Hammond's three-scales framework has significant implications for both pedagogy and assessment:

**Teaching Implications**

The framework suggests that teachers need to attend to all three scales explicitly:

1. **First-scale knowledge** must be taught and checked, but recognised as foundational rather than sufficient
2. **Second-scale knowledge** must be developed through explicit teaching of historical concepts and frameworks
3. **Third-scale knowledge** requires teaching approaches that build rich, contextual understanding rather than thin factual recall

Hammond argues that conventional teaching often focuses on the first two scales while neglecting the third. Teachers may assume that third-scale knowledge will develop naturally from reading and discussion, or they may sacrifice depth for coverage, leaving students with thin factual knowledge that cannot support sophisticated historical thinking.

**Assessment Implications**

Hammond's framework provides a diagnostic tool for analysing student work. When a student produces an argument that is structurally sound but historically thin, the problem is likely lack of third-scale knowledge. When a student struggles to organise their knowledge into coherent argument, the problem may be lack of second-scale framework knowledge.

The framework also challenges conventional approaches to assessment design. GCSE mark schemes, Hammond argues, often reward the linguistic markers of historical thinking without requiring the substance that would make thinking genuinely historical. Students can achieve high marks by deploying causal language and evaluative vocabulary without the rich contextual knowledge that would make their arguments historically convincing.

## Teaching Sensitive and Difficult Topics

### The Holocaust and Historical Significance

In her influential 2006 article 'From horror to history: teaching pupils to reflect on significance', Hammond addresses one of the most challenging topics in the history curriculum: teaching the Holocaust to Year 9 students (aged 13–14). This work demonstrates Hammond's commitment to teaching that combines intellectual rigour with ethical seriousness.

Hammond identifies the tensions that teachers must navigate when teaching this topic:

- How can young teenagers develop a mature response to devastating atrocity?
- How can they swiftly gain enough knowledge to place the Holocaust in a variety of broader contexts?
- What is the relationship between serious, detached, historical analysis and moral, human, or emotional response?
- What kinds of big historical concepts can support that analysis?
- What kinds of moral reasoning can develop understanding of those concepts?

Hammond's approach, developed through practical experimentation, emphasises the importance of helping students move from initial emotional response ('horror') to historical understanding ('history'). This does not mean suppressing emotional or moral response, but rather developing the conceptual tools that enable students to engage with the Holocaust as a historical phenomenon requiring analysis and explanation, not merely as a symbol of evil.

Her teaching sequence focuses on the concept of historical significance, helping students understand the criteria by which historians judge events to be historically significant and applying these criteria to the Holocaust. This approach enables students to develop arguments about why the Holocaust matters historically that go beyond the obvious moral dimensions to engage with questions about causation, consequence, and change.

### Pedagogical Principles

Hammond's work on difficult topics embodies several pedagogical principles:

- **Intellectual challenge**: Students are capable of sophisticated conceptual thinking about difficult topics when given appropriate support
- **Conceptual scaffolding**: Abstract historical concepts provide frameworks that enable students to process and understand difficult content
- **Knowledge building**: Emotional and moral engagement must be grounded in secure historical knowledge
- **Rigour and empathy**: Historical rigour and human empathy are complementary rather than contradictory

## Teaching Historical Methods and Theories

### Cliometricians and Microhistorians

In her 2008 article 'Teaching Year 9 about historical theories and methods', Hammond describes a learning sequence that introduced students to two contrasting approaches to history: cliometrics (quantitative, structural, 'scientific' history) and microhistory (qualitative, narrative, anthropological history).

This work exemplifies Hammond's commitment to teaching students about the nature of historical knowledge itself. Rather than treating historical methods as transparent or unproblematic, Hammond makes them an explicit object of study. Students learn not just what historians have concluded, but how they reached their conclusions and what theoretical commitments shaped their work.

The learning sequence Hammond describes enables students to:

- Understand the theoretical commitments that distinguish different approaches to history
- Recognise that historical methods are choices that shape the knowledge historians produce
- Develop their own informed views about the strengths and limitations of different approaches
- Apply their understanding of method to the evaluation of historical accounts

This approach connects to broader developments in history education, particularly the focus on 'how we know about the past' that has characterised the Schools History Project and the National Curriculum's emphasis on interpretations of history.

### The Relationship Between Knowledge and Method

Hammond's work on historical methods connects to her three-scales framework. Understanding different historical approaches requires:

- **First-scale knowledge**: Knowing what cliometricians and microhistorians do
- **Second-scale knowledge**: Understanding the conceptual frameworks that structure these approaches
- **Third-scale knowledge**: Appreciating the particular texture of historical knowledge produced by each approach

Hammond's teaching demonstrates how explicit attention to historical methods can deepen students' understanding of the discipline and enhance their ability to evaluate historical claims.

## Influence and Legacy

### Contribution to Professional Knowledge

Kate Hammond's work has made several significant contributions to professional knowledge in history education:

1. **Conceptual clarity**: The three-scales framework provides a vocabulary for discussing different types of historical knowledge that has been widely adopted in professional discourse
2. **Assessment critique**: Her analysis of the gap between assessment success and genuine understanding has influenced debates about assessment design
3. **Pedagogical innovation**: Her practical examples of teaching sequences demonstrate how theoretical insights can be embodied in classroom practice
4. **Practitioner research methodology**: Her work models how teachers can investigate their own practice systematically and contribute to professional knowledge

### Influence on Curriculum and Assessment Debates

Hammond's work has been particularly influential in debates about curriculum and assessment in history education. Her critique of assessment practices that reward generic performance over genuine historical understanding has informed discussions about:

- The design of examination questions and mark schemes
- The relationship between knowledge and skills in history education
- The importance of rich, substantive knowledge in the curriculum
- The dangers of 'teaching to the test' that focuses on assessment techniques rather than historical understanding

Her work has been cited in support of arguments for knowledge-rich curricula and for assessment approaches that require genuine historical understanding rather than the performance of historical thinking.

### Connection to Broader Developments

Hammond's work connects to and informs several broader developments in history education:

- **The knowledge turn**: Her emphasis on the importance of rich, substantive knowledge aligns with broader movements in curriculum thinking that challenge skills-based approaches
- **Cognitive science**: Her framework resonates with cognitive science research on the importance of domain-specific knowledge for expert performance
- **Assessment reform**: Her critique of conventional assessment has informed debates about how to assess historical understanding more validly
- **Disciplinary literacy**: Her work contributes to understanding of what it means to read, write, and think historically

## Practical Applications for Teachers

### Using the Three Scales in Planning

Teachers can apply Hammond's framework in curriculum planning by asking:

- What first-scale knowledge do students need to access this topic?
- What second-scale conceptual frameworks will help them organise this knowledge?
- What third-scale contextual knowledge will enable them to construct historically convincing arguments?
- How will I ensure that third-scale knowledge is developed, not just first and second?

### Analysing Student Work

The three scales provide a diagnostic framework for analysing student work:

- Does the student have sufficient first-scale knowledge? (Can they recall basic facts?)
- Can they deploy second-scale frameworks? (Can they structure arguments using appropriate concepts?)
- Do they have the third-scale knowledge that would make their arguments historically convincing? (Is there substance behind the structure?)

### Developing Assessment Approaches

Hammond's work suggests that effective assessment:

- Requires demonstration of third-scale knowledge, not just first and second
- Values historical conviction and specificity over generic analytical performance
- Provides feedback that helps students develop across all three scales
- Designs tasks that make it difficult to succeed through generic performance alone

## Conclusion

Kate Hammond's contribution to history education exemplifies the power of practitioner research to generate insights that are both theoretically sophisticated and practically useful. Her three-scales framework has provided teachers with conceptual tools for thinking more clearly about the relationship between knowledge and thinking in history education. Her practical examples demonstrate how theoretical insights can be translated into classroom practice. And her critical analysis of assessment has informed ongoing debates about how to evaluate and certify historical understanding.

Hammond's work reminds us that history education is fundamentally about building knowledge—rich, contextual, substantive knowledge that enables students to understand the past in ways that are genuinely historical. The challenge for teachers is not merely to develop students' analytical skills or their familiarity with historical language, but to build the knowledge base that makes sophisticated historical thinking possible. Hammond's framework helps teachers meet this challenge by providing a vocabulary for distinguishing between different types of knowledge and a set of principles for building knowledge that 'flavours' historical claims with genuine substance.
