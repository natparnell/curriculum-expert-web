# The Historical Thinking Project and Stanford History Education Group

## Introduction

The Historical Thinking Project (Canada) and the Stanford History Education Group (SHEG, USA) represent two of the most significant initiatives in history education over the past two decades. While operating in different national contexts, both projects share a common commitment to promoting historical thinking—the cognitive processes through which students learn to analyse, evaluate, and interpret the past. Through curriculum resources, assessment tools, and research, these projects have influenced history education internationally, providing frameworks and materials that support teachers in developing students' historical literacy.

The Stanford History Education Group, founded and led by Sam Wineburg at Stanford University, has become particularly renowned for its "Reading Like a Historian" curriculum and its research on how students evaluate online information. The Historical Thinking Project, based in Canada and led by Peter Seixas, developed a framework for historical thinking concepts that has influenced curriculum development across Canada and beyond. Together, these projects represent a transnational movement to prioritise historical thinking in history education.

This profile examines both projects, their origins, key frameworks, curriculum resources, research contributions, and their influence on history education in North America and internationally.

## The Stanford History Education Group (SHEG)

### Origins and Leadership

The Stanford History Education Group (SHEG) was founded by Sam Wineburg, a cognitive psychologist and historian of education at Stanford University. Wineburg's work has been grounded in understanding how historians read and think, and how these expert practices can be taught to students. His 2001 book *Historical Thinking and Other Unnatural Acts* established the theoretical foundations for SHEG's work, arguing that historical thinking is not intuitive but must be deliberately taught.

SHEG emerged from Wineburg's research on the differences between how historians and students approach historical texts. Using think-aloud protocols, Wineburg demonstrated that historians read sources differently than novices—employing strategies of sourcing, contextualisation, and corroboration that students typically do not use. This research suggested that effective history teaching should make these expert strategies explicit, teaching students to read like historians.

### The "Reading Like a Historian" Curriculum

SHEG's most influential contribution is the "Reading Like a Historian" curriculum, a collection of lessons designed to engage students in historical inquiry. Each lesson focuses on a central historical question and presents students with primary source documents to analyse and evaluate. The curriculum covers topics in US and world history, from the earliest civilisations to the Cold War.

The lessons follow a consistent structure:

1. **Introduction**: A central historical question is posed, engaging students' curiosity and setting up the inquiry.

2. **Background reading**: Students read brief background information to establish context for the documents.

3. **Document analysis**: Students read and analyse 3-5 primary source documents, using sourcing, contextualisation, and corroboration strategies.

4. **Discussion and debate**: Students discuss the documents and the central question, developing evidence-based arguments.

5. **Conclusion**: Students reach a conclusion about the central question, supported by evidence from the documents.

The curriculum explicitly teaches historical thinking strategies:

- **Sourcing**: Considering who wrote a document, when, and for what purpose, and how this affects its reliability and usefulness.

- **Contextualisation**: Situating documents in their historical context, understanding how the circumstances of their production shaped their content.

- **Corroboration**: Comparing multiple documents to identify agreements and discrepancies, building a more complete picture of the past.

- **Close reading**: Careful attention to the language and arguments of documents, identifying claims, evidence, and rhetorical strategies.

### Research on Online Information Evaluation

In recent years, SHEG has become known for its research on "civic online reasoning"—how students evaluate information they encounter online. This research, conducted with surveys of students at different levels from middle school to university, has revealed alarming gaps in students' ability to distinguish reliable from unreliable online sources.

Key findings from this research include:

- **Difficulty with sourcing**: Students rarely investigate who created online content or what their purposes might be.

- **Susceptibility to sponsored content**: Many students cannot distinguish between news articles and sponsored content or advertising.

- **Over-reliance on search engine ranking**: Students often assume that content appearing at the top of search results is more reliable.

- **Struggles with social media**: Students have difficulty evaluating the reliability of claims made on social media platforms.

These findings have significant implications for history education. In an age of widespread misinformation, the ability to evaluate sources critically—skills central to historical thinking—has become essential for civic participation. SHEG's research has made a powerful case for the civic importance of history education.

### Assessment Resources: Beyond the Bubble

SHEG has developed innovative assessment resources through its "Beyond the Bubble" initiative. These assessments move beyond traditional multiple-choice questions to assess students' historical thinking skills. Using primary source documents, the assessments require students to engage in sourcing, contextualisation, and corroboration.

The "Beyond the Bubble" assessments exemplify a broader movement in history education towards assessing conceptual understanding rather than merely factual recall. They provide models for how teachers can design assessments that target historical thinking skills.

## The Historical Thinking Project (Canada)

### Origins and Framework

The Historical Thinking Project was a national initiative in Canada funded by the Department of Canadian Heritage, active from 2006 to 2014. Led by Peter Seixas, a historian of education at the University of British Columbia, the project developed a framework of six historical thinking concepts that has influenced curriculum development across Canada.

The six historical thinking concepts are:

1. **Historical Significance**: How do we decide what is important to learn about the past? What criteria do we use to determine historical significance?

2. **Evidence**: How do we know what we know about the past? How do we evaluate historical sources and construct historical arguments?

3. **Cause and Consequence**: Why do events happen, and what are their effects? How do we explain historical change?

4. **Continuity and Change**: How do we distinguish between what has changed and what has stayed the same over time? How do we characterise historical developments?

5. **Historical Perspectives**: How can we understand the perspectives of people in the past whose values and worldviews may differ from our own?

6. **The Ethical Dimension**: How can history help us live in the present? What responsibilities do we have as a result of historical events?

These concepts were designed to be integrated throughout the history curriculum, providing a framework for organising content and assessing student learning. The project developed resources to support teachers in implementing the framework, including lesson plans, assessment tools, and professional development materials.

### Peter Seixas and Canadian History Education

Peter Seixas, the director of the Historical Thinking Project, has been a leading figure in Canadian and international history education. His work has explored the relationship between historical understanding and collective memory, the nature of historical consciousness, and the teaching of historical thinking.

Seixas's scholarship has been particularly influential in theorising the relationship between history education and identity. His work on "historical consciousness" examines how individuals and societies orient themselves in time through historical narratives, and how history education can contribute to the development of more sophisticated forms of historical consciousness.

In his edited volume *Theorizing Historical Consciousness* (2004), Seixas brought together scholars from multiple countries to explore how history education can help students develop the capacity to think historically about the past and its relationship to the present. This work connected the Canadian Historical Thinking Project to broader international debates about the purposes of history education.

### Curriculum Implementation

The Historical Thinking Project framework has been implemented in curriculum documents across Canada. Provinces including British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario have incorporated the six historical thinking concepts into their social studies and history curricula.

This implementation has been supported by:

- **Teacher resources**: The project developed lesson plans, teaching strategies, and assessment tools aligned with the historical thinking concepts.

- **Professional development**: Workshops and courses were offered to help teachers understand and implement the framework.

- **Assessment tools**: The project developed assessments targeting historical thinking skills, providing models for classroom and large-scale assessment.

- **Research**: Ongoing research has investigated how students develop historical thinking and how teaching can support this development.

## Comparative Analysis

### Similarities

Despite operating in different national contexts, the SHEG and Historical Thinking Project approaches share significant similarities:

- **Focus on historical thinking**: Both prioritise developing students' capacity to think historically over the transmission of factual content.

- **Emphasis on primary sources**: Both approaches engage students with primary source documents as the raw material of historical inquiry.

- **Active student engagement**: Both reject passive transmission models in favour of inquiry-based approaches that require students to analyse, evaluate, and construct arguments.

- **Research foundation**: Both are grounded in research on how historians think and how students learn history.

- **Practical resources**: Both have developed extensive curriculum resources that teachers can use in their classrooms.

### Differences

The two projects also exhibit differences reflecting their different contexts and emphases:

- **Scope**: SHEG has focused primarily on developing curriculum resources, while the Historical Thinking Project developed a broader conceptual framework for curriculum design.

- **Assessment**: SHEG has been particularly innovative in developing assessment tools, while the Historical Thinking Project focused more on curriculum frameworks.

- **Civic emphasis**: SHEG's recent work has emphasised the civic importance of historical thinking, particularly in the digital age. The Historical Thinking Project gave more explicit attention to questions of identity and the ethical dimension of history.

- **National context**: The Historical Thinking Project was explicitly designed for the Canadian context, with attention to Canadian history and identity. SHEG's resources are more focused on US history, though they have been adapted internationally.

## International Influence

### Influence in England

Both the SHEG and Historical Thinking Project have influenced history education in England, though often indirectly. The emphasis on historical thinking aligns with the approach developed through the Schools History Project and articulated by figures such as Christine Counsell, Michael Riley, and Peter Lee.

The Canadian framework of six historical thinking concepts has parallels with the English emphasis on second-order concepts (evidence, causation, change, etc.). While the specific concepts differ, the underlying approach—prioritising historical thinking over factual recall—is shared.

English history educators have drawn on SHEG resources, particularly the "Reading Like a Historian" lessons, as models for enquiry-based teaching. The SHEG assessments have also influenced thinking about how to assess historical thinking.

### Global Reach

Both projects have had influence beyond North America and the UK. The "Reading Like a Historian" curriculum has been translated into multiple languages and adapted for different national contexts. The Historical Thinking Project framework has informed curriculum development in Australia, New Zealand, and other countries.

This international influence reflects a growing global consensus about the importance of historical thinking in history education. Around the world, educators are recognising that the ability to analyse sources, evaluate claims, and construct arguments about the past is essential for informed citizenship in the twenty-first century.

## Criticism and Debate

### Questions of Content Coverage

Critics have raised questions about whether an emphasis on historical thinking comes at the expense of content knowledge. If students spend time learning how to analyse sources and construct arguments, do they sacrifice knowledge of historical periods, events, and processes?

Defenders of the historical thinking approach argue that content and thinking are inseparable: students cannot think historically without knowing something about the past, and they cannot develop deep knowledge of the past without thinking historically. The question is not whether to teach content or thinking but how to integrate them.

### Assessment Challenges

Assessing historical thinking presents significant challenges. Traditional standardised tests focus on factual recall and can be administered efficiently to large numbers of students. Assessing historical thinking requires more complex tasks that are harder to standardise and score reliably.

Both SHEG and the Historical Thinking Project have developed innovative assessments, but these remain more resource-intensive than traditional tests. Scaling up assessment of historical thinking remains a challenge for education systems.

### Cultural Context

Some critics have questioned whether the historical thinking framework is culturally specific, reflecting Western traditions of historical scholarship. They argue that other cultures may have different ways of relating to the past that are not captured by the SHEG or Historical Thinking Project frameworks.

Proponents respond that while specific practices may vary, the capacity to evaluate evidence, understand context, and construct warranted claims about the past is valuable across cultures. They acknowledge the need for sensitivity to different cultural relationships with the past while maintaining that critical historical thinking is essential for informed citizenship globally.

## Legacy and Continuing Relevance

### Resources for Teachers

Both the SHEG and Historical Thinking Project have left lasting legacies in the form of curriculum resources that teachers continue to use. The "Reading Like a Historian" lessons and the Historical Thinking Project materials remain valuable resources for teachers seeking to implement enquiry-based history teaching.

These resources are particularly valuable for teachers new to historical thinking approaches, providing models that they can adapt and build upon. The availability of free, high-quality resources has lowered barriers to implementing historical thinking in classrooms.

### Research Contributions

The research conducted by both projects has advanced understanding of how students learn history and how historical thinking can be taught. Wineburg's research on expert-novice differences, SHEG's studies of online information evaluation, and the Historical Thinking Project's investigations of how students understand historical concepts have all contributed to the research base in history education.

This research continues to inform practice and policy, providing evidence for the importance of historical thinking and guidance for how to teach it effectively.

### Ongoing Relevance

In an age of widespread misinformation and partisan division, the capacity to evaluate sources, understand context, and construct warranted claims about the past has never been more important. Both the SHEG and Historical Thinking Project have made powerful cases for the civic importance of history education, and their frameworks remain highly relevant.

The SHEG's research on civic online reasoning is particularly timely, addressing challenges that have emerged with the rise of digital media. As students increasingly encounter historical claims through social media and other online platforms, the skills taught through historical thinking curricula have become essential for informed citizenship.

## Conclusion

The Stanford History Education Group and the Historical Thinking Project represent landmark achievements in history education. Through their curriculum resources, research, and conceptual frameworks, they have promoted historical thinking as a central goal of history education, influencing practice in North America and internationally.

While operating in different national contexts and with different emphases, both projects share a commitment to teaching students to think historically—to analyse sources, evaluate claims, understand context, and construct arguments about the past. This commitment reflects a broader movement in history education away from transmission of factual content towards development of disciplinary understanding.

The resources developed by these projects continue to support teachers in implementing historical thinking approaches. Their research has advanced understanding of how students learn history and how historical thinking can be assessed. Their conceptual frameworks have shaped curriculum development and influenced how educators think about the purposes of history education.

As history education faces new challenges in the digital age, the work of SHEG and the Historical Thinking Project provides valuable foundations. The capacity to evaluate online information, to recognise misinformation, and to construct warranted claims about the past—skills central to historical thinking—have become essential for democratic citizenship. The projects' enduring legacy lies in having established these skills as central goals of history education.
