# Peter Lee: Key Thinker in History Education

## Biographical Overview

Peter Lee is one of the most influential British history education researchers of the past half-century, whose work has fundamentally shaped how we understand children's historical thinking and the aims of history education. Until his retirement, he was Reader in Education at the Institute of Education, University of London (now UCL Institute of Education), where he worked for several decades developing innovative approaches to understanding how young people learn history.

Lee began his teaching career at Latymer Upper School in London before being recruited to the Institute of Education by Hedley Burston, who headed the History Department. This transition from classroom teacher to teacher educator and researcher occurred during the 1960s, a period when the influence of child psychology was beginning to reshape educational thinking. Lee became interested in ways of developing children's thinking in history, moving beyond the transmission of factual content toward an understanding of history as a discipline with distinctive ways of knowing.

## The CHATA Project: Concepts of History and Teaching Approaches

### Origins and Methodology

Lee's most significant and enduring contribution to history education research came through the **CHATA (Concepts of History and Teaching Approaches)** project, conducted during the 1970s and 1980s in collaboration with Rosalyn Ashby and Alaric Dickinson. This ambitious research programme investigated how children aged 7 to 14 develop their understanding of historical concepts.

The CHATA project was groundbreaking in its methodology. Ros Ashby developed the research approach from her own history teaching experience in Essex comprehensive schools. By analysing video-recordings of pupils' discussions about historical questions, she and Lee developed sophisticated ideas about the process by which students arrive at an understanding of history. This naturalistic, dialogic approach to research captured authentic student thinking in ways that traditional written assessments could not.

The research team engaged students in sustained conversations about historical problems, probing their reasoning about evidence, causation, change, and historical accounts. Through careful analysis of these interactions, Lee and his colleagues were able to identify patterns in children's developing historical thinking and map what genuine progression in historical understanding might look like.

### Key Findings

The CHATA project yielded several findings that continue to inform history teaching today:

1. **Children's capacity for disciplinary thinking**: Lee demonstrated that even young children are capable of sophisticated historical reasoning when given appropriate tasks and support. They are not merely empty vessels to be filled with facts, but active thinkers who construct their understanding of the past through engagement with evidence and argument.

2. **The distinction between first and second-order concepts**: One of Lee's most influential contributions was clarifying the distinction between **substantive knowledge** (the content of history—names, dates, events) and **procedural or second-order concepts** (the disciplinary tools historians use, such as causation, evidence, change and continuity, and historical significance).

3. **Progression is not simply additive**: Lee showed that progression in historical understanding involves qualitative shifts in thinking, not merely the accumulation of more facts. Students develop increasingly sophisticated frameworks for understanding historical problems, moving from common-sense or "everyday" approaches toward more disciplined historical reasoning.

## The Distinction Between First and Second-Order Concepts

Perhaps Lee's most significant theoretical contribution is the clear articulation of the distinction between first-order and second-order concepts, which has become foundational to history curriculum thinking in the UK and internationally.

### First-Order Concepts (Substantive Knowledge)

First-order concepts relate to the content of history—the "what" that is studied. These include:
- Specific events (the Norman Conquest, the Industrial Revolution)
- Individuals (Elizabeth I, Martin Luther King)
- Periods (the Middle Ages, the Cold War)
- Themes (empire, democracy, migration)

Lee argued that while this substantive knowledge is essential, it is not sufficient for historical understanding. Students can know many facts without understanding what history is or how historical knowledge is constructed.

### Second-Order Concepts (Procedural or Metahistorical Knowledge)

Second-order concepts, which Lee variously called **procedural concepts** or **metahistorical understandings**, relate to the discipline of history itself—the "how" and "why" of historical inquiry. These include:

| Second-Order Concept | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Evidence** | Understanding how we know about the past through sources and the problems of using them |
| **Causation** | Understanding why events happened and the relationship between different causes |
| **Change and Continuity** | Understanding patterns of stability and transformation over time |
| **Similarity and Difference** | Understanding how periods, societies or experiences compare |
| **Historical Significance** | Understanding why some events or people are considered more important than others |
| **Historical Accounts** | Understanding why historians construct different narratives of the same past |

Lee and Ashby (2000) described these as "the ideas that provide our understanding of history as a discipline or form of knowledge." They argued that these second-order concepts should be the organising principles of the history curriculum because they provide the intellectual tools students need to engage with substantive content in meaningful ways.

## Historical Literacy

Lee developed the concept of **historical literacy** to capture what should be central to history education. In his influential chapter "History Education and Historical Literacy" (in Debates in History Teaching), Lee argued that a sense of what history education should add up to was often curiously absent from discussions about teaching quality.

Historical literacy, in Lee's formulation, involves:

1. **Understanding history as a form of knowledge**: Recognising that historical claims are not simply facts to be memorised but conclusions reached through particular methods of inquiry.

2. **Understanding historical concepts**: Grasping second-order concepts like evidence, causation, and accounts well enough to apply them to new historical problems.

3. **Understanding the nature of historical accounts**: Recognising that historical narratives are constructions that reflect historians' questions, perspectives, and purposes—not simply copies of the past.

Lee drew on Jorn Rusen's model of historical consciousness to connect history education with broader questions of how individuals and societies orient themselves in time. This connection between disciplinary understanding and historical consciousness has been influential in curriculum debates internationally.

## Progression in Historical Understanding

### A Scaffold, Not a Cage

In their influential 2003 article "A Scaffold, Not a Cage" (Teaching History), Lee and Denis Shemilt critiqued simplistic models of progression that treated the National Curriculum attainment target as a developmental model. They argued that such models risked becoming straitjackets rather than supports for teaching.

Lee proposed instead that progression in historical understanding should be understood as movement from everyday, common-sense thinking toward more disciplined historical reasoning. This progression is characterised by:

- **Increasing sophistication in handling evidence**: Moving from seeing sources as information containers to understanding them as evidence that requires interpretation and corroboration.

- **More nuanced understanding of causation**: Developing from single-cause explanations toward understanding the interplay of multiple factors operating at different scales.

- **More sophisticated handling of historical accounts**: Moving from the belief that "the past is what happened" toward understanding that historical narratives are constructed by historians with particular purposes and perspectives.

### Empirical Models of Progression

Lee's work on progression was grounded in extensive empirical research. Through the CHATA project and subsequent studies, he and his colleagues identified stages or levels through which students typically move in their understanding of particular historical concepts. These were not age-related stages but descriptions of increasingly sophisticated reasoning.

For example, Lee and Shemilt's research on progression in understanding historical accounts identified levels ranging from a "copy" theory (historical accounts simply copy what happened) through recognition of perspective and purpose toward sophisticated understanding of how historians construct different but equally valid narratives depending on their questions and criteria of significance.

Lee was careful to emphasise that such models are **scaffolds for teaching** rather than developmental inevitabilities. Students do not automatically progress through these levels with age; progression depends on appropriate teaching that makes disciplinary demands explicit.

## Understanding Historical Accounts

### The "Copy" Theory Problem

Lee's research revealed a persistent problem in students' understanding of history: the tendency to view historical accounts as direct copies or photographs of the past. In their 2004 article "'I just wish we could go back in the past and find out what really happened'" (Teaching History), Lee and Shemilt explored students' ideas about historical accounts and found many believing that the only barrier to certainty about the past was the absence of time travel.

This "copy theory" of historical accounts has significant implications for how students respond to conflicting narratives. If accounts are supposed to copy the past, then differences between accounts can only be explained by error or bias. Lee argued that students need to develop a more sophisticated understanding: that historical accounts are **constructed** by historians who make decisions about what to include, how to connect events, and what significance to assign.

### The Problem of Competing Stories

Lee and Shemilt warned that tackling historians' reasons for writing one story rather than another before students grasp that accounts cannot be copies of the past is "a recipe for leaving them helplessly shrugging their shoulders in the face of competing stories." Students need first to understand that accounts are constructions; only then can they engage productively with why different constructions are possible and valid.

This insight has significant implications for curriculum planning. It suggests that teaching about historical interpretation—why historians disagree—should not be reserved for advanced students but is foundational to historical understanding at all levels.

## Collaboration with Denis Shemilt

Lee's work with Denis Shemilt at the University of Leeds extended and deepened the research programme begun with CHATA. Shemilt had previously led the Schools History Project (SHP) and brought extensive curriculum development experience to the collaboration. Together, they explored:

- **Frameworks for progression**: Developing models that could support teacher assessment and curriculum planning
- **The relationship between assessment and learning**: Investigating how different assessment approaches shape students' historical thinking
- **Evidence-based practice**: Building a research base that could inform teaching decisions

Their partnership exemplified the productive relationship between curriculum development and research that has characterised the best of British history education. While Shemilt brought practitioner insight from leading curriculum innovation, Lee contributed rigorous research methodology and theoretical clarity.

## Influence and Legacy

### Impact on the National Curriculum

Lee's research directly influenced the development of the English National Curriculum for history. His distinction between first and second-order concepts provided the intellectual framework for the 1991 and subsequent iterations of the curriculum. The key elements—historical enquiry, using evidence, understanding historical interpretation—reflect Lee's insistence that history education should be about disciplinary understanding, not merely the transmission of facts.

### International Influence

Lee's work has had significant international influence, particularly in Canada, Australia, and the United States. The **Benchmarks of Historical Thinking** project in Canada drew directly on Lee and Ashby's research in developing frameworks for historical thinking. Lee's collaboration with American researchers such as Sam Wineburg and Peter Seixas helped establish an international community of history education scholars committed to understanding historical cognition.

### Contemporary Relevance

Lee's work remains highly relevant to contemporary debates in history education:

1. **Powerful knowledge**: Lee's arguments about second-order concepts anticipate recent interest in "powerful knowledge" as the appropriate content of the school curriculum. His work provides a developed account of what powerful knowledge in history might look like.

2. **Cognitive science and history education**: As cognitive science increasingly influences educational thinking, Lee's careful research into children's historical thinking offers a model for how empirical investigation can illuminate subject-specific cognition.

3. **Assessment and progression**: As England moves toward a more knowledge-focused curriculum, Lee's work on progression in historical understanding offers resources for thinking about what progression in knowledge might mean.

4. **Digital history and information literacy**: Lee's insights about how students understand historical evidence and accounts are directly relevant to contemporary concerns about digital literacy and the ability to evaluate online information about the past.

## Implications for Classroom Practice

Lee's research has several key implications for classroom practice:

### Teaching for Conceptual Understanding

Teachers should design activities that make second-order concepts explicit. Rather than assuming that students will pick up disciplinary thinking implicitly, teachers should foreground questions about evidence, causation, change, and accounts.

### Progression as Teaching Goal

Progression in historical understanding does not happen automatically. Teachers need to plan for progression by designing sequences of activities that move students toward more sophisticated reasoning. Lee's research provides descriptions of what more sophisticated reasoning looks like, which can inform planning.

### The Importance of Dialogue

The CHATA methodology of engaging students in sustained discussion about historical problems should be reflected in classroom practice. Giving students opportunities to articulate and defend their historical reasoning is essential for developing understanding.

### Addressing Misconceptions

Lee's research identified common misconceptions about history—such as the "copy" theory of accounts—that persist across age groups. Teachers should explicitly address these misconceptions, recognising that they represent natural, everyday ways of thinking about the past that need to be challenged and developed.

### Balancing Substance and Discipline

Lee never argued that second-order concepts should displace substantive content. Rather, he insisted that they transform how students engage with that content. Teachers should aim for the integration of substantive and disciplinary knowledge, using second-order concepts to structure enquiry into historical topics.

## Critical Evaluation

### Strengths

Lee's work offers several significant strengths:

- **Empirical grounding**: His arguments are based on extensive research with actual students, not abstract theorising.
- **Conceptual clarity**: The distinction between first and second-order concepts provides a powerful tool for curriculum thinking.
- **Practical relevance**: Despite its theoretical sophistication, Lee's work has clear implications for classroom practice and curriculum design.
- **International scope**: His collaborations have ensured that his influence extends beyond the UK context.

### Questions and Debates

Several questions have been raised about aspects of Lee's work:

1. **The relationship between second-order concepts and historical knowledge**: Some critics have questioned whether second-order concepts can be separated from substantive content in the way Lee sometimes suggests. Historical thinking always involves thinking about something; the concepts cannot be fully abstracted from the content.

2. **Cultural specificity**: Lee's research was conducted primarily in English schools. Questions remain about the extent to which his findings about progression apply across different educational and cultural contexts.

3. **The role of knowledge**: Recent interest in curriculum knowledge has raised questions about whether Lee's framework gives sufficient attention to the specific content that students should learn.

4. **Assessment challenges**: While Lee's models of progression have influenced thinking about assessment, translating them into practical assessment tools remains challenging.

## Conclusion

Peter Lee stands as one of the most significant figures in the development of history education as a field of research. His work has transformed our understanding of what it means to learn history, demonstrating that young people are capable of sophisticated disciplinary thinking and providing frameworks for supporting the development of that thinking.

The distinction between first and second-order concepts, the concept of historical literacy, and the empirical research on progression in historical understanding constitute a substantial and enduring contribution to the field. Lee's insistence that history education should be about understanding the discipline of history—not merely accumulating facts—has shaped curriculum thinking in the UK and internationally.

For teachers, Lee's work offers both inspiration and practical guidance. It inspires by showing what students are capable of; it guides by providing frameworks for planning, teaching, and assessing that can support students in realising that capability. As history education continues to evolve in response to new challenges—from digital information literacy to debates about curriculum knowledge—Lee's foundational research provides essential resources for informed practice.
