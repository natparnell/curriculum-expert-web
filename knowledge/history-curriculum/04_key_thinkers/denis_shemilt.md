# Denis Shemilt: Historical Empathy and the Architecture of Historical Understanding

## Introduction

Denis Shemilt stands as one of the most influential figures in the development of history education in England during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. His work, spanning from the groundbreaking evaluation of the Schools History Project (SHP) in the 1970s through to his collaborative research on historical thinking in the 2000s and 2010s, has fundamentally shaped how history educators understand student progression, the nature of historical empathy, and the architecture of historical consciousness. Unlike many of his contemporaries who approached history education from a purely historical background, Shemilt brought to the field the methodological rigour of social science and statistics, combined with a deep philosophical engagement with what it means to think historically.

Shemilt's contribution to history education cannot be understood in isolation from the broader revolution in history teaching that occurred in England from the 1970s onwards. The movement away from a purely content-driven, fact-recitation model of history education towards one centred on historical enquiry, conceptual understanding, and disciplinary thinking owes much to Shemilt's research and curriculum development work. His 1980 evaluation of the Schools History Project, often cited by Peter Lee as "the most important landmark in both research and curriculum development in history education in the UK in the twentieth century," established empirically that students taught through enquiry-based methods could think in more complex and sophisticated ways about the past than had previously been thought possible.

## Biography and Career

### Early Background and Formation

Denis Shemilt's academic formation was unusual among the leading figures of the history education revolution in England. While many of his contemporaries, such as Christine Counsell and Michael Riley, came to history education through traditional historical training and classroom teaching, Shemilt's background was in statistics and social science. This disciplinary formation would prove consequential for his approach to history education research, equipping him with methodological tools and an analytical disposition that distinguished his work from more impressionistic or anecdotal accounts of teaching and learning.

As Shemilt himself acknowledged in a 2009 interview conducted by Nicola Sheldon for the History in Education Project, his background in statistics and social science equipped him particularly well to act as an evaluator of educational programmes. The quantitative and qualitative research skills he had developed enabled him to design studies that could capture not merely what students knew about the past, but how they thought about it—their conceptual understanding, their epistemological assumptions, and their developing historical consciousness.

### The Schools History Project and the 1980 Evaluation Study

Shemilt's entry into history education came in 1976 when he was recruited by David Sylvester to evaluate the Schools Council History Project, commonly known as the Schools History Project or SHP. The Project, still in its pilot stage when Shemilt joined, represented a radical departure from traditional history teaching in England. Under Sylvester's leadership, the SHP sought to make history more accessible and relevant to students during a period that saw the comprehensive education reform bringing students of mixed ability into the same classrooms.

Sylvester worked from the assumption that the historical method, as practised by professional historians, supplied the means for this transformation. Historians did what history students traditionally did not: they imaginatively reconstructed the thoughts, motives, and intentions behind past people's actions. The SHP sought to bring this disciplinary authenticity into the classroom through enquiry-based learning, engagement with primary sources, and an emphasis on historical concepts rather than mere factual coverage.

When Sylvester recruited Shemilt to write an evaluation of the Project, the newcomer's training in historical methodology consisted, by his own account, of reading R.G. Collingwood. This philosophical engagement with the nature of historical knowledge would prove formative. Shemilt's evaluation, published in 1980 as the *History 13-16 Evaluation Study* by Holmes McDougall, was not merely a statistical accounting of student outcomes but a profound investigation into what students understood about the nature of history itself.

The evaluation study was methodologically innovative and rigorous. Shemilt demonstrated that children taught by the SHP method could think in more complex ways about the past than their peers in traditional programmes. The evaluation was not without its critics—Jon Nichol, among others, raised questions about its methodology and conclusions—but it has been widely recognised as establishing the credentials of the SHP and, more broadly, as providing empirical warrant for the new approaches to history teaching that were emerging in England.

### Director of the Schools History Project

Following his work on the evaluation, Shemilt went on to become Director of the Schools History Project. In this role, he oversaw the continued development and dissemination of the SHP approach, working to ensure that the insights generated by the Project's research and curriculum development reached classrooms across England. The SHP under Shemilt's directorship continued to innovate, developing resources and approaches that influenced history teaching far beyond the Project's immediate participants.

The SHP's influence during this period cannot be overstated. It provided a model for what enquiry-based history teaching could look like in practice, demonstrating that it was possible to engage students of all abilities in genuine historical thinking. The Project's emphasis on second-order concepts—change and continuity, cause and consequence, similarity and difference, historical significance, and the use of historical evidence—would become central to the National Curriculum when it was introduced in 1991, and remains so in the current National Curriculum for History.

### Graduate Training and Later Career

In his later career, Shemilt moved into graduate training, working to develop the next generation of history education researchers and teacher educators. This work represented a logical extension of his earlier contributions: having helped to establish empirically and conceptually what sophisticated historical thinking looked like in students, he now turned his attention to ensuring that those responsible for educating history teachers understood these insights and could translate them into effective pedagogy.

Throughout his career, Shemilt maintained a close association with the University of Leeds, where the SHP was based. His work there connected him with a network of history education researchers and practitioners that included not only David Sylvester but also, in time, researchers such as Peter Lee and Rosalyn Ashby with whom he would collaborate on the CHATA project and subsequent research on historical thinking.

## Historical Empathy: Original Framing and Development

### The Conceptual Challenge

Historical empathy represents perhaps Shemilt's most distinctive and controversial contribution to history education. The concept—broadly understood as the capacity to understand past people's beliefs, values, and actions in their own terms, rather than judging them by present-day standards—had been discussed in history education circles since at least the 1970s. However, it was Shemilt, particularly in his collaboration with Peter Lee, who subjected the concept to the most rigorous theoretical and empirical investigation.

Shemilt opened his influential chapter on historical empathy with a metaphor borrowed from the Stoic philosopher Epictetus: "like any beautiful woman, the theory of 'empathic reconstruction' excites the devotion of some and the censure of others." This captures something important about the status of empathy in history education: it has been simultaneously celebrated as essential to historical understanding and criticised as unhistorical, sentimental, or even impossible.

The challenges facing historical empathy as an educational goal are substantial. How can we truly understand people who lived in radically different circumstances, holding beliefs and values that may seem strange or even repellent to us? Does the attempt to empathise risk projecting our own assumptions onto the past, rather than genuinely understanding historical actors in their own terms? And how can educators assess whether students have achieved genuine empathetic understanding, as opposed to mere imaginative projection or anachronistic identification?

### Shemilt's Framework for Historical Empathy

Shemilt's work on historical empathy, developed over several decades and in collaboration with Peter Lee, provided a framework for addressing these challenges that was both theoretically sophisticated and practically applicable in the classroom. Central to this framework is the distinction between different levels or stages of empathetic understanding, and the recognition that progression in empathy involves increasingly complex and nuanced ways of thinking about past people's beliefs and actions.

In their landmark 2011 article "The Concept That Dares Not Speak Its Name: Should Empathy Come Out of the Closet?" published in *Teaching History* 143, Lee and Shemilt identified three fundamental challenges that empathy poses to students:

1. **Making sense of human behaviour**: Understanding why people in the past acted as they did, given their circumstances and beliefs.

2. **Understanding why practices that seem irrational and unreasonable today were common in the past**: Recognising that historical actors operated within different frameworks of belief and value, and that what appears irrational from a modern perspective may have been entirely rational within those frameworks.

3. **Grasping what does and does not count as empathetic**: Developing metacognitive awareness of the nature of empathetic understanding and the pitfalls to be avoided (such as anachronism, presentism, and uncritical identification).

This framework moves beyond a simple "presentist" versus "empathetic" dichotomy to recognise that students' understanding of the past develops through recognisable stages, each with its own characteristic ways of thinking about historical actors.

### Progression in Historical Empathy

Building on the research methodology developed in the CHATA project (Concepts of History and Teaching Approaches), Shemilt and Lee mapped how students' ideas about historical empathy develop between the ages of seven and fourteen. This research revealed that progression in empathy is not simply a matter of accumulating more information about the past, but involves qualitative shifts in how students conceptualise the relationship between past and present, and between their own perspectives and those of historical actors.

At earlier stages, students tend to approach the past through what might be called "common sense" assumptions: people in the past were essentially the same as people today, and their actions can be judged by the same standards. This can lead to what Shemilt termed "conspiratorial" or "projective" thinking, where students attribute to historical actors motives and understandings derived from their own experience.

As students progress, they begin to recognise that people in the past held different beliefs and values, and that these differences matter for understanding their actions. However, this recognition initially takes a relatively crude form: the past is seen as a repository of error and ignorance, with historical actors judged for their failure to anticipate modern knowledge and values.

More sophisticated empathetic understanding involves what Shemilt called "contextual" thinking: the recognition that historical actors' beliefs and actions were shaped by their specific circumstances, and that these beliefs and actions made sense within their own frameworks of meaning. At this level, students can understand past practices that appear strange or wrong from a modern perspective, not by endorsing those practices, but by comprehending the logic that made them seem reasonable to those who engaged in them.

The highest levels of empathetic understanding involve what might be called "dialogical" thinking: the capacity to move between past and present perspectives, using understanding of historical contexts to illuminate present concerns while remaining critically aware of the distance between past and present. This involves not merely understanding what historical actors believed, but understanding how their beliefs structured their experience and made certain courses of action seem necessary or desirable.

### Pedagogical Implications

Shemilt's work on historical empathy has profound implications for classroom practice. It suggests that teaching for empathy is not simply a matter of encouraging students to "imagine themselves in the past"—indeed, such exercises can reinforce projective and anachronistic thinking if not carefully structured. Rather, effective empathy teaching requires:

- **Attention to context**: Students need rich information about the specific circumstances in which historical actors operated, including their material conditions, social relationships, and cultural frameworks.

- **Focus on evidence**: Empathetic understanding must be grounded in evidence about what historical actors actually believed and did, rather than speculative reconstruction.

- **Explicit attention to second-order concepts**: Students need to understand the nature of historical empathy as a disciplinary practice, including the difference between empathy and sympathy, and the dangers of anachronism and presentism.

- **Structured opportunities for reflection**: Students need opportunities to articulate and examine their own assumptions about the past, and to compare their initial intuitions with evidence-based understandings.

- **Assessment that targets conceptual understanding**: Assessment of empathy should focus on the sophistication of students' thinking about past perspectives, not merely on the amount of information they can reproduce.

## The CHATA Project and Progression in Historical Understanding

### Origins and Methodology

The Concepts of History and Teaching Approaches (CHATA) project, conducted in the 1990s with Peter Lee and Rosalyn Ashby, represents Shemilt's most sustained empirical investigation into how students' historical understanding develops. Building on the methodology developed for the SHP evaluation, CHATA sought to map progression in students' understanding of key historical concepts across the age range seven to fourteen.

The CHATA methodology involved extensive clinical interviewing of students, using carefully designed tasks that probed their understanding of historical concepts such as evidence, accounts, causation, change, and empathy. This approach allowed researchers to access students' tacit assumptions about the nature of history, revealing the conceptual frameworks through which they made sense of the past.

The project's findings challenged prevailing assumptions about what students at different ages were capable of understanding. Barca, disseminating CHATA findings internationally, questioned the widely accepted view that young students could not understand the complexity of history before the age of sixteen. The CHATA research demonstrated that students as young as seven were capable of sophisticated historical thinking when appropriately supported, while also revealing that many older students continued to hold naïve or simplistic assumptions about the nature of historical knowledge.

### A Scaffold, Not a Cage

One of the most important contributions of the CHATA research, articulated in Shemilt and Lee's 2003 article "A Scaffold, Not a Cage: Progression and Progression Models in History" published in *Teaching History* 113, was the development of research-based models of progression that could inform teaching and assessment. The article's title captures a crucial insight: progression models should serve as scaffolding to support student development, not as cages that limit expectations or constrain teaching.

Shemilt and Lee argued that the National Curriculum attainment target, with its linear levels, failed to capture the complexity of historical understanding. Reaching Level 5 did not automatically define a student's understanding of history as a discipline, and certainly did not capture the complexities that genuine historical understanding entails. The CHATA progression models, by contrast, offered fine-grained accounts of how students' ideas about specific historical concepts develop, providing teachers with diagnostic tools for identifying where students were in their conceptual development and what next steps would be most productive.

The CHATA models of progression differed from the National Curriculum levels in several important respects:

- **Concept-specific**: Rather than offering a single ladder of progression for "historical understanding," CHATA developed separate models for different second-order concepts (evidence, causation, change, etc.), recognising that students might be at different stages with respect to different concepts.

- **Research-based**: The models were grounded in extensive empirical research with students, not derived from abstract assumptions about what students ought to be able to do at different ages.

- **Descriptive rather than normative**: The models described how students' thinking actually developed, rather than prescribing what they should be able to do at particular ages.

- **Attentive to preconceptions**: The models identified common preconceptions and misconceptions that could act as barriers to progression, enabling teachers to anticipate and address these in their planning.

### Progression in Understanding Historical Accounts

In their 2004 article "'I Just Wish We Could Go Back in the Past and Find Out What Really Happened': Progression in Understanding About Historical Accounts" (*Teaching History* 117), Lee and Shemilt applied this approach to students' understanding of historical accounts. The research revealed that students' preconceptions about history—as captured in the titular quote, expressing a desire to bypass interpretation and access "what really happened"—were powerful and persistent.

The article presented a research-based progression model that traced how students' understanding of historical accounts develops from naïve realism (the assumption that the past is directly accessible and that accounts simply record what happened) through various stages of recognition that history involves interpretation, selection, and construction. At more sophisticated levels, students come to understand that the differences between historical accounts reflect not merely error or bias but genuine differences of interpretation, perspective, and emphasis that arise from historians' different questions, sources, and conceptual frameworks.

This work has profound implications for teaching. It suggests that students need to be introduced early to the idea that historical accounts are constructed and contested, and that this introduction needs to be carefully scaffolded to avoid the cynicism that can result from too-early exposure to radical scepticism about historical knowledge. Students need to understand both why historical accounts differ and how historians nevertheless make warranted claims about the past.

### Progression in Understanding Cause and Consequence

In their 2009 article "Is Any Explanation Better Than None?" (*Teaching History* 137), Shemilt and Lee turned their attention to progression in understanding cause and consequence in history. The article examined the "over-determined narratives, senseless agencies and one-way streets" that characterise students' early attempts at causal explanation in history.

The research revealed that students often approach causation in history through frameworks derived from everyday experience rather than historical thinking. This can lead to what the article termed "over-determined" narratives, where every antecedent event is treated as a cause; "senseless agencies," where the causal efficacy of abstract structures and processes is not recognised; and "one-way streets," where causal relationships are understood as simple and linear rather than complex and multi-directional.

The CHATA progression model for causation traced how students' understanding develops from these naïve approaches through increasing recognition of the complexity of historical causation, including:
- The distinction between necessary and sufficient conditions
- The role of structural factors alongside individual agency
- The unintended consequences of actions
- The multi-directional nature of causal relationships
- The criteria for establishing causal significance

## Narrative Frameworks and "The Caliph's Coin"

### The Problem of Narrative in History Education

One of Shemilt's most original contributions to history education theory is his work on narrative frameworks, articulated most fully in his 2000 chapter "The Caliph's Coin: The Currency of Narrative Frameworks in History Teaching," published in *Knowing, Teaching and Learning History: National and International Perspectives*, edited by Peter Seixas, Peter Stearns, and Sam Wineburg. This work addresses a fundamental tension in history education: history is necessarily taught and learned through narratives, but narratives inevitably simplify, select, and structure the past in ways that can distort as well as illuminate.

The title of Shemilt's chapter alludes to the story of the Caliph who offered a reward to anyone who could explain why the Islamic empire had expanded so rapidly. A scholar presented a narrative of military conquest and administrative genius; the Caliph rewarded him with a coin. Another scholar presented a narrative of religious fervour and divine favour; the Caliph rewarded him with a coin. A third scholar presented both narratives, showing how they interlocked and complemented each other; the Caliph rewarded him with the kingdom.

Shemilt uses this parable to illustrate the value of what he terms "polythetic" narratives—accounts that incorporate multiple perspectives and explanatory frameworks, recognising that historical phenomena are typically over-determined, the product of many interacting causes and contexts. The Caliph's coin represents the currency of simpler, single-strand narratives; the kingdom represents the richer understanding that comes from multi-dimensional narrative frameworks.

### Levels of Narrative Framework

In "The Caliph's Coin," Shemilt distinguishes between four levels of narrative framework that students might employ in making sense of the past:

**Level 1: Fragmentary or Episodic Narratives**
At this level, students perceive the past as a series of disconnected events, without coherent narrative structure. History is experienced as a collection of stories or facts that do not cohere into larger patterns. This represents the least sophisticated form of historical understanding, where students cannot connect events into meaningful sequences or identify larger historical processes.

**Level 2: Single-Strand Narratives**
At this level, students construct narratives that follow a single thread or theme through time. These narratives have coherence and structure, but they achieve this by selective attention, following one strand of development (typically political or military history) while neglecting others. The result is a simplified but comprehensible account that captures some aspects of historical change while obscuring others.

**Level 3: Multidimensional Narratives**
At this level, students construct narratives that interweave multiple strands of historical development. Shemilt suggests that teachers use three interlocking dimensions to construct such narratives: means of production and population history; forms of social organisation; and cultural and intellectual history. These dimensions are not separate but interconnected, with changes in one dimension affecting and being affected by changes in others.

**Level 4: Polythetic Narratives**
At the highest level, students construct what Shemilt calls "polythetic" narratives—accounts that incorporate multiple, sometimes competing, perspectives and explanatory frameworks. These narratives do not simply add more strands but recognise that historical events can be validly interpreted in different ways, depending on the questions asked and the frameworks employed. Polythetic narratives accommodate complexity, contradiction, and contestation, recognising that historical understanding is always provisional and perspectival.

### Pedagogical Implications of Narrative Framework Theory

Shemilt's theory of narrative frameworks has significant implications for curriculum design and classroom practice. It suggests that the goal of history education should not be merely to teach students "what happened" in the past, but to develop their capacity to construct and evaluate increasingly sophisticated narrative frameworks.

This has several practical consequences:

- **Curriculum as narrative construction**: Rather than treating the curriculum as a body of content to be covered, teachers should see it as an opportunity for students to construct and refine narrative frameworks. This means giving students opportunities to engage with different ways of organising and interpreting the past.

- **Attention to the relationship between narrative and evidence**: Students need to understand that narratives are constructed from evidence, but that evidence does not dictate a single narrative. Different narratives may be equally well-supported by evidence, depending on the questions asked and the frameworks employed.

- **Teaching for polythetic understanding**: Rather than seeking to produce consensus or closure, effective history teaching should help students hold multiple perspectives in tension, recognising the validity of different interpretations while also being able to evaluate their relative strengths and weaknesses.

- **Developmental appropriateness**: The theory suggests that younger students may need support in constructing even single-strand narratives, while older students should be challenged to construct multidimensional and eventually polythetic accounts. The goal is to help students move up the hierarchy of narrative sophistication, not to demand polythetic understanding before students have mastered simpler narrative forms.

## Relationship to Christine Counsell's Framework

### Complementary Perspectives

Denis Shemilt's work on historical empathy and progression in historical understanding has a complex and productive relationship with Christine Counsell's curriculum framework. While the two scholars have approached history education from different angles—Shemilt from empirical research on student thinking, Counsell from curriculum theory and teacher development—their work is deeply complementary and mutually reinforcing.

Shemilt's research provides empirical warrant for many of the practices that Counsell advocates. The CHATA progression models, for instance, offer detailed accounts of how students develop the kinds of disciplinary understanding that Counsell's framework emphasises. When Counsell argues that students need to understand history as a form of knowledge, with its own distinctive concepts and procedures, she can draw on Shemilt's research to show that students are capable of such understanding when appropriately taught.

Similarly, Shemilt's work on historical empathy provides the theoretical and empirical foundation for Counsell's emphasis on the importance of understanding historical actors in their own terms. The progression models developed by Shemilt and Lee map out the journey from presentist judgement to contextual understanding that Counsell's framework seeks to facilitate.

### The Residue Concept and Empathetic Understanding

One particularly important point of connection between Shemilt's work and Counsell's framework concerns the concept of "residue"—the knowledge and understanding that remains with students after the details of specific topics have been forgotten. Shemilt's research on progression in historical understanding can be seen as an investigation into what should constitute this residue.

If historical education is to have lasting value, it cannot consist merely in the accumulation of facts about the past, most of which will be forgotten. Rather, the residue should include the conceptual frameworks and habits of mind that enable students to approach new historical questions with disciplinary sophistication. Shemilt's progression models identify the forms of understanding that have this lasting value: the capacity to recognise that historical accounts are constructed and contested; the ability to understand past perspectives in their own terms; the recognition of the complexity of historical causation.

This connects directly to Counsell's argument that the history curriculum should be designed around second-order concepts and disciplinary procedures rather than around content coverage. Both scholars agree that what matters is not what students can remember about particular topics, but what they can do with historical knowledge—their capacity to think historically.

### Assessment and Progression

Shemilt's work has also informed Counsell's thinking about assessment. The CHATA research revealed the limitations of the National Curriculum level descriptions as tools for assessing historical understanding. The level descriptions were not based on research into how students actually develop, and they conflated different aspects of historical understanding into single linear scales.

Counsell has drawn on Shemilt's research to argue for more sophisticated approaches to assessment, approaches that target specific conceptual understanding and that recognise the complexity of progression. The idea that assessment should be "a scaffold, not a cage"—that it should support student development rather than constrain it—has been influential in thinking about how to design assessment systems that genuinely promote historical learning.

### The Schools History Project Legacy

Both Shemilt and Counsell have deep connections to the Schools History Project. Shemilt, as we have seen, was Director of the Project and author of its landmark evaluation. Counsell, though she came to the Project later, has been deeply influenced by its approaches and has contributed significantly to its continued development.

The SHP represents a synthesis of the empirical research tradition associated with Shemilt and the curriculum development tradition associated with Counsell. The Project's emphasis on enquiry-based learning, on the development of second-order conceptual understanding, and on assessment that targets historical thinking rather than factual recall reflects the combined influence of these two towering figures in history education.

## Key Publications

### History 13-16 Evaluation Study (1980)

Shemilt's first major publication, the *History 13-16 Evaluation Study* (Edinburgh: Holmes McDougall, 1980), remains one of the most important works in the history of history education research. The study evaluated the Schools Council History Project, demonstrating empirically that students taught through enquiry-based methods could think in more complex ways about the past than students in traditional programmes.

The evaluation was methodologically innovative, combining quantitative measures of student outcomes with qualitative analysis of student thinking. Shemilt developed techniques for assessing not merely what students knew about the past, but how they thought about it—their conceptual understanding, their epistemological assumptions, and their historical consciousness.

The study established the credentials of the SHP approach and provided empirical warrant for the new approaches to history teaching that were emerging in England. It has been widely cited and has influenced thinking about history education internationally.

### "The Caliph's Coin" (2000)

Shemilt's chapter "The Caliph's Coin: The Currency of Narrative Frameworks in History Teaching," published in *Knowing, Teaching and Learning History: National and International Perspectives* (New York University Press, 2000), edited by Peter Seixas, Peter Stearns, and Sam Wineburg, offers a sophisticated theory of the role of narrative in history education.

The chapter distinguishes between four levels of narrative framework—fragmentary/episodic, single-strand, multidimensional, and polythetic—and argues that the goal of history education should be to help students construct increasingly sophisticated narratives. The "Caliph's Coin" parable illustrates the value of polythetic narratives that incorporate multiple perspectives and explanatory frameworks.

This work has been influential in shaping thinking about curriculum design and about the relationship between narrative and historical understanding. It connects the empirical research tradition associated with the CHATA project to broader questions about the nature of historical knowledge and the goals of history education.

### CHATA Project Publications (1990s–2000s)

The Concepts of History and Teaching Approaches (CHATA) project generated a series of influential articles in *Teaching History*, the journal of the Historical Association. These include:

- "A Scaffold, Not a Cage: Progression and Progression Models in History" (with Peter Lee, *Teaching History* 113, 2003)
- "'I Just Wish We Could Go Back in the Past and Find Out What Really Happened': Progression in Understanding About Historical Accounts" (with Peter Lee, *Teaching History* 117, 2004)
- "Is Any Explanation Better Than None?" (with Peter Lee, *Teaching History* 137, 2009)

These articles present research-based models of progression for key historical concepts, including evidence, accounts, causation, change, and empathy. They have been widely cited and have informed both curriculum design and teacher education in England and beyond.

### "The Concept That Dares Not Speak Its Name" (2011)

The article "The Concept That Dares Not Speak Its Name: Should Empathy Come Out of the Closet?" (*Teaching History* 143, 2011), co-authored with Peter Lee, represents Shemilt's most sustained treatment of historical empathy. The article addresses the controversies surrounding empathy in history education and presents a framework for understanding progression in empathetic understanding.

The article identifies three challenges that empathy poses to students: making sense of human behaviour; understanding why practices that seem irrational today were common in the past; and grasping what does and does not count as empathetic. It presents a progression model that traces how students' empathetic understanding develops from projective or presentist approaches through contextual understanding to dialogical thinking.

### The Future of the Past (2011)

Shemilt co-edited, with Lukas Perikleous, the volume *The Future of the Past: Why History Education Matters* (Nicosia: AHDR, 2011). This collection brings together contributions from leading international scholars in history education, addressing fundamental questions about the purposes and practices of history teaching.

The volume reflects Shemilt's international influence and his engagement with debates about history education in different national contexts. It includes contributions on historical consciousness, narrative, assessment, and the role of history education in democratic societies.

## Legacy and Influence

### Impact on the National Curriculum

Shemilt's research has had a profound influence on the National Curriculum for History in England. The emphasis on second-order concepts—change and continuity, cause and consequence, similarity and difference, historical significance, and the use of evidence—that has characterised the National Curriculum since its inception in 1991 reflects the research findings of the SHP evaluation and the CHATA project.

The current National Curriculum, introduced in 2014, retains this emphasis on disciplinary concepts and procedures. The requirement that students should "understand historical concepts such as continuity and change, cause and consequence, similarity, difference and significance, and use them to make connections, draw contrasts, analyse trends, frame historically-valid questions and create their own structured accounts" directly reflects Shemilt's research on progression in historical understanding.

### Influence on Teacher Education

Shemilt's work has been influential in shaping how history teachers are educated. His research on progression provides a framework for understanding student learning that has been widely adopted in initial teacher education and continuing professional development. The CHATA progression models, in particular, offer a resource for teachers seeking to diagnose student understanding and plan instruction that will move students forward.

Shemilt's emphasis on the importance of understanding student thinking has influenced approaches to teacher education. Rather than focusing solely on teaching techniques, effective teacher education must also develop teachers' understanding of how students learn history—their preconceptions, their misconceptions, and the pathways through which they develop more sophisticated understanding.

### International Influence

Shemilt's influence extends well beyond England. His work has been widely cited in the international history education literature, and he has been influential in shaping thinking about history education in Europe, North America, and beyond.

The CHATA research, in particular, has informed international debates about progression in historical understanding. The finding that young students are capable of sophisticated historical thinking when appropriately supported has challenged assumptions about the age at which disciplinary concepts can be introduced. The progression models developed by Shemilt and Lee have been adapted and applied in various national contexts.

Shemilt's work on historical empathy has also been influential internationally. The framework for understanding progression in empathetic understanding has informed teaching and curriculum development in many countries, and the concept of historical empathy has been widely adopted as a goal of history education.

### Relationship to Subsequent Research

Shemilt's research has provided the foundation for much subsequent work in history education. The CHATA methodology—clinical interviewing designed to probe students' conceptual understanding—has been widely adopted and adapted by other researchers. The focus on progression in understanding of specific historical concepts has shaped the research agenda in history education.

More recent research, including the work of scholars such as Arthur Chapman, has built on Shemilt's foundations, developing more sophisticated theoretical frameworks and extending the empirical base. The tradition of research into student thinking about history that Shemilt helped to establish continues to be one of the most productive areas of inquiry in history education.

### The Continuing Relevance of Shemilt's Work

Despite being conducted several decades ago, Shemilt's research remains highly relevant to contemporary history education. The fundamental insights—that students' historical understanding develops through recognisable stages, that progression involves qualitative shifts in conceptual understanding, that effective teaching must take account of students' preconceptions—remain as valid today as when they were first established.

Contemporary debates about the history curriculum, about assessment, and about the purposes of history education continue to be informed by Shemilt's research. The tension between content coverage and conceptual understanding, between factual knowledge and disciplinary thinking, between present relevance and historical integrity—all these debates are illuminated by Shemilt's empirical work on how students actually think about the past.

As history education continues to evolve in response to new challenges and opportunities, Shemilt's research provides a foundation of empirical evidence and theoretical insight that will continue to guide practice. His work represents a model of how rigorous research can inform educational practice, improving the quality of teaching and learning for students of all ages and abilities.

## Conclusion

Denis Shemilt's contribution to history education is difficult to overstate. From his groundbreaking evaluation of the Schools History Project through to his sustained research on progression in historical understanding, Shemilt has shaped how educators think about what it means to learn and teach history. His work on historical empathy, on narrative frameworks, and on the development of historical consciousness has provided theoretical frameworks and empirical foundations that continue to inform practice.

Shemilt brought to history education the methodological rigour of social science, combined with a deep philosophical engagement with the nature of historical knowledge. This unusual combination enabled him to conduct research that was both empirically grounded and theoretically sophisticated, addressing fundamental questions about the nature of historical understanding and how it develops.

The Schools History Project, the CHATA research, and the numerous publications that emerged from these initiatives have established a tradition of research-informed practice in history education that continues to flourish. Shemilt's work demonstrated that it is possible to investigate rigorously how students think about the past, and that such investigation can yield insights that transform teaching and learning.

For teachers seeking to develop their practice, for curriculum designers seeking to create effective programmes of study, and for researchers seeking to extend our understanding of historical learning, Shemilt's work remains essential reading. His legacy is not merely a body of research findings, but a way of thinking about history education that values empirical evidence, conceptual clarity, and the ultimate goal of developing students who can think historically about the past and its relationship to the present.
