# David Sylvester: Founding the Schools History Project

## Introduction

David Sylvester stands as one of the most significant figures in the history of history education in England. As the founding director of the Schools History Project (SHP) in 1972, Sylvester initiated a transformation in how history was taught in secondary schools that continues to influence practice today. The SHP's emphasis on enquiry-based learning, engagement with primary sources, and the development of historical thinking represented a radical departure from traditional approaches and established the foundations for modern history education in England.

Sylvester's vision was shaped by his experience as a history teacher, his engagement with developments in historical scholarship, and his commitment to making history accessible to all students in the emerging comprehensive school system. He recognised that traditional history teaching, focused on the transmission of factual knowledge to an academic elite, was neither effective nor just. The SHP was designed to transform history into a subject that engaged all students in genuine historical thinking.

This profile examines Sylvester's career, the founding and early development of the Schools History Project, his pedagogical vision, the challenges he faced in establishing the project, and his lasting influence on history education in England.

## Early Career and Formation

### Teaching Background

David Sylvester began his career as a history teacher in the 1950s and 1960s, working in grammar schools and then in the emerging comprehensive schools. This practical classroom experience provided the foundation for his later work. Teaching in comprehensive schools during their formative period gave Sylvester direct insight into the challenges of teaching history to students of diverse abilities and backgrounds.

The comprehensive school movement, which gained momentum in the 1960s, brought students of all abilities into the same schools, challenging the selective system that had divided students into grammar, technical, and secondary modern schools. Sylvester recognised that history teaching needed to change to meet the needs of this new comprehensive intake. Traditional approaches, designed for academically able grammar school students, were not appropriate for the full ability range.

### Engagement with Historical Scholarship

Sylvester's vision for history education was informed by his engagement with developments in historical scholarship. The mid-twentieth century saw significant developments in historical methodology, including the growth of social history, the Annales school, and new approaches to understanding historical change. Sylvester believed that school history should reflect these developments, engaging students with the questions and methods that animated professional historical scholarship.

This engagement with historical scholarship distinguished Sylvester's approach from those who saw school history as merely simplified academic history. Sylvester wanted students to encounter history as a form of inquiry, not merely as a body of content to be memorised. This meant engaging with primary sources, considering historical interpretations, and developing the capacity to construct historical arguments.

## Founding the Schools History Project

### The 1972 Initiative

The Schools History Project was established in 1972 under the auspices of the Schools Council, the body responsible for curriculum development in England at that time. Sylvester was appointed as the Project's founding director, based at the University of Leeds. The Project was initially conceived as a pilot scheme to develop new approaches to history teaching for the 13-16 age group.

The timing was significant. The early 1970s was a period of curriculum innovation in England, with the Schools Council supporting a range of projects designed to transform teaching and learning. The comprehensive school system was expanding, creating both the need and the opportunity for new curricular approaches. The SHP was one of many School Council projects, but it would prove to be one of the most influential and enduring.

### The SHP Philosophy

From the outset, the Schools History Project was guided by a clear philosophy that distinguished it from traditional history teaching. The Project's approach was characterised by:

**Enquiry-Based Learning**

The SHP rejected the traditional model of history teaching as the transmission of established knowledge. Instead, it promoted enquiry-based learning, where students engaged actively with historical questions and sources. Lessons were structured around enquiry questions that required students to analyse evidence, evaluate interpretations, and reach substantiated conclusions.

This approach was inspired by the methods of professional historians. Sylvester believed that students should encounter history as historians do—as a process of inquiry involving the analysis of sources, the construction of arguments, and the evaluation of competing interpretations. This did not mean that students were expected to work exactly like professional historians, but that they should engage in authentic historical thinking appropriate to their level.

**Engagement with Primary Sources**

A distinctive feature of the SHP approach was its emphasis on primary source work. Students were expected to engage directly with historical documents, photographs, artefacts, and other sources, using them as evidence to answer historical questions. This engagement with sources was designed to develop students' understanding of how historical knowledge is constructed and to foster critical thinking about historical claims.

The use of primary sources was not merely illustrative, providing visual interest to lessons. Rather, sources were the raw material of historical inquiry, to be analysed, evaluated, and used as evidence. Students learned to ask questions of sources: Who created this? When? For what purpose? How reliable is it? What can it tell us about the past?

**Development of Historical Thinking**

The SHP prioritised the development of historical thinking over the memorisation of factual content. While content knowledge was not neglected, it was seen as the context for developing understanding of historical concepts—cause and consequence, change and continuity, similarity and difference, historical significance, and the use of historical evidence.

This focus on historical thinking was innovative. Traditional history teaching had often assumed that students would develop historical understanding simply by learning historical content. The SHP recognised that historical thinking needs to be taught explicitly, with attention to the concepts and procedures that characterise historical inquiry.

**Accessibility for All**

A fundamental commitment of the SHP was that history should be accessible to all students, not merely an academic elite. This commitment emerged from the comprehensive school context and from Sylvester's belief in the educational value of history for all young people. The Project's materials and approaches were designed to engage students of all abilities, providing challenge and support appropriate to diverse learners.

This commitment to accessibility distinguished the SHP from some curriculum innovations that were designed primarily for able students. Sylvester insisted that enquiry-based history could work for all students, given appropriate scaffolding and support. The SHP's piloting and evaluation would eventually demonstrate that this belief was well-founded.

## The Pilot Programme and Early Development

### Pilot Schools

The SHP began with a pilot programme involving schools in Yorkshire and beyond. These pilot schools were the testing ground for the Project's approaches, providing feedback on what worked and what needed refinement. Sylvester worked closely with teachers in these schools, supporting them in implementing the new approaches and learning from their experiences.

The pilot programme was essential to the SHP's development. Rather than developing materials in isolation and then imposing them on schools, the Project worked iteratively, developing approaches in collaboration with teachers and refining them in response to classroom experience. This collaborative approach ensured that the SHP's materials and methods were grounded in the realities of classroom practice.

### Developing Curriculum Materials

Under Sylvester's direction, the Project developed curriculum materials that embodied its philosophy. These included pupil booklets, teacher guides, and source collections. The materials were designed to support enquiry-based learning, providing the resources that teachers and students needed to engage in historical investigation.

The development of these materials was a significant undertaking. Creating source collections that were accessible to students while remaining historically authentic required careful selection and editing. Designing enquiries that would engage students and develop their historical thinking required pedagogical expertise and understanding of how students learn history.

### The SHP Examination

A key element of the SHP was the development of a new examination for 16-year-olds, offered by the Oxford and Cambridge Schools Examination Board. The SHP examination assessed students' historical thinking through questions that required analysis of sources, evaluation of interpretations, and construction of arguments. This was a significant departure from traditional examinations that focused primarily on factual recall.

The development of the examination was crucial to the SHP's success. For schools to adopt the Project's approaches, they needed to be confident that students would be assessed fairly. The SHP examination demonstrated that enquiry-based learning and rigorous assessment were compatible. Students who had learned through enquiry could demonstrate their understanding in examinations that assessed their historical thinking.

## Denis Shemilt and the Evaluation

### Recruiting an Evaluator

In 1976, Sylvester recruited Denis Shemilt to conduct an evaluation of the Schools History Project. Shemilt, with a background in statistics and social science, was appointed to assess whether the SHP approach was effective in developing students' historical understanding. This evaluation would prove to be one of the most significant in the history of education research in England.

Sylvester's decision to commission a rigorous evaluation reflected his commitment to evidence-based practice. He believed that the SHP's approaches were effective, but he wanted empirical evidence to support this belief. The evaluation would provide the warrant for the SHP's methods, demonstrating that students taught through enquiry-based approaches could think in more sophisticated ways about the past.

### The 1980 Evaluation Study

Shemilt's evaluation, published in 1980 as the *History 13-16 Evaluation Study*, demonstrated conclusively that the SHP approach was effective. Students taught through the SHP method showed more sophisticated understanding of historical concepts than their peers in traditional programmes. The evaluation established the credibility of the SHP and provided empirical support for the new approaches to history teaching that were emerging in England.

The evaluation was methodologically innovative, combining quantitative measures of student outcomes with qualitative analysis of student thinking. Shemilt developed techniques for assessing not merely what students knew about the past, but how they thought about it—their conceptual understanding, their epistemological assumptions, and their historical consciousness.

For Sylvester, the evaluation vindicated the SHP approach. The Project's philosophy, which some had dismissed as unrealistic or appropriate only for able students, was shown to be effective with the full range of students. The evaluation provided the foundation for the SHP's expansion and influence.

## Legacy and Continuing Influence

### Establishing a New Paradigm

Sylvester's work with the Schools History Project established a new paradigm for history education in England. The SHP demonstrated that history could be taught as a form of inquiry, engaging all students in genuine historical thinking. This paradigm has shaped history education in England for five decades and continues to influence practice today.

The SHP approach became the foundation for the National Curriculum for History, introduced in 1991. The emphasis on second-order concepts, on engagement with sources, and on the development of historical thinking that characterises the National Curriculum reflects the SHP philosophy that Sylvester established.

### The Ongoing SHP

The Schools History Project continues today, more than fifty years after its founding. While Sylvester moved on from the directorship in the early 1980s, handing over to Denis Shemilt, the Project has maintained its commitment to enquiry-based history teaching. The SHP remains a significant presence in English history education, providing curriculum resources, professional development, and a community of practice for history teachers.

The longevity of the SHP is testament to the strength of Sylvester's original vision. While educational fashions have come and gone, the fundamental principles that Sylvester established—the importance of enquiry, the value of source work, the need to develop historical thinking—remain as relevant today as in the 1970s.

### Influence on Teacher Education

The SHP has profoundly influenced how history teachers are educated. The Project's approaches are embedded in PGCE programmes and professional development courses. Beginning teachers learn to teach history through enquiry, to use sources effectively, and to develop students' historical thinking. This professional formation ensures that Sylvester's influence continues through successive generations of history teachers.

### International Influence

The SHP's influence has extended beyond England. The Project's approaches have informed history education in many countries, and SHP materials have been adapted for use internationally. The SHP model of enquiry-based history teaching has become a reference point for history educators worldwide.

## Conclusion

David Sylvester's contribution to history education is difficult to overstate. Through the Schools History Project, he initiated a transformation in how history is taught in English schools. His vision of history as a form of inquiry, accessible to all students, established the foundations for modern history education.

Sylvester's work exemplifies the power of curriculum development to transform educational practice. The SHP was not merely a research project or a theoretical framework; it was a practical intervention that changed what happened in classrooms. Through the development of curriculum materials, examinations, and professional development, Sylvester translated his vision into practice.

The enduring legacy of Sylvester's work lies in the thousands of history teachers who teach through enquiry, the millions of students who have encountered history as a form of thinking, and the established consensus that history education should develop historical understanding, not merely transmit factual knowledge. The Schools History Project, which he founded in 1972, continues to shape history education in England and beyond, a testament to the power of his original vision.
