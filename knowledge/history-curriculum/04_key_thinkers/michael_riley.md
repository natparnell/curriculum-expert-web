# Michael Riley: Enquiry-Based History Teaching and the Power of Questions

## Introduction

Michael Riley stands as one of the most influential figures in the development of history teaching in England since the 1990s. His work on enquiry-based learning, the craft of designing rigorous enquiry questions, and the teaching of emotive and controversial history has shaped classroom practice and influenced the professional development of thousands of history teachers. Riley's contribution bridges the gap between academic history education research and practical classroom application, making sophisticated pedagogical ideas accessible to practitioners.

Riley's influence extends through multiple channels: his prolific writing for *Teaching History*, the journal of the Historical Association; his work as a school development adviser and teacher educator; his development of curriculum materials, most notably the *Think Through History* series and the *Enquiring History* series; and his contributions to professional development courses and initial teacher education. His collaboration with Jamie Byrom has been particularly productive, producing influential frameworks for teaching emotive and controversial history at Key Stage 3.

This profile examines Riley's career trajectory, his seminal contributions to enquiry-based pedagogy—particularly his influential 2000 article "Into the Key Stage 3 History Garden: Choosing and Planting Your Enquiry Questions"—his work on teaching controversial history, his curriculum development activities, and his influence on the Schools History Project and wider history education in England.

## Early Career and Formation

### Background

Michael Riley began his career as a history teacher, working in comprehensive schools during the 1980s and early 1990s. This classroom experience provided the foundation for his subsequent work; his writing and curriculum development have always been grounded in the realities of teaching history to mixed-ability classes in state secondary schools.

Riley's early career coincided with significant developments in history education. The Schools History Project (SHP), established in the 1970s, was gaining influence, demonstrating that enquiry-based approaches could engage students in genuine historical thinking. The National Curriculum for History was introduced in 1991, bringing new requirements and new challenges for history teachers. Riley's work developed within this context, seeking to support teachers in navigating the changing landscape while maintaining focus on what matters most: developing students' historical understanding.

### The Somerset Context

A significant portion of Riley's career was spent working in Somerset. He served as School Development Adviser for Somerset Local Education Authority, a role that involved supporting history teachers across the county to develop their practice. This advisory role gave Riley insight into the challenges facing history teachers in diverse school contexts and informed his approach to professional development.

The Somerset context was significant for Riley's development. Working as an adviser allowed him to observe practice across multiple schools, identifying common challenges and effective responses. It also provided opportunities for collaboration with other history educators, including connections with the Historical Association and the Schools History Project network.

## The "History Garden" Article: Enquiry Questions

### The Seminal Contribution

Riley's most influential single contribution to history education is his 2000 article "Into the Key Stage 3 History Garden: Choosing and Planting Your Enquiry Questions," published in *Teaching History* 99. This article has been described by the Historical Association as "seminal" and continues to be cited as essential reading for history teachers designing schemes of work. The metaphor of the garden—of choosing and planting enquiry questions—has become deeply embedded in the discourse of history education.

The article emerged from a specific context: the introduction of the QCA (Qualifications and Curriculum Authority) Scheme of Work for Key Stage 3 History in 2000. This national scheme of work provided a framework for the KS3 history curriculum, but Riley recognised that effective implementation required more than simply following the prescribed units. Teachers needed to engage with the material actively, selecting and framing enquiry questions that would drive student learning.

### The Characteristics of Good Enquiry Questions

Riley's article articulates the characteristics of effective enquiry questions, providing practical criteria that teachers can apply when designing their own schemes of work. He identifies several key features:

**Rigour and Challenge**

Good enquiry questions must be intellectually rigorous. They should require students to engage with genuine historical problems, not merely to recall factual information. Riley emphasises that enquiry questions should be "worth asking"—that they should address significant historical issues and require students to think historically.

The rigour of an enquiry question relates to its capacity to drive historical thinking. Questions that simply ask students to describe what happened do not constitute genuine historical enquiries. Effective questions require students to analyse, evaluate, or explain—engaging with second-order concepts such as cause, change, or significance.

**Motivation and Engagement**

Enquiry questions should engage students' interest and motivation. Riley recognised that the way a question is framed can significantly affect students' engagement with the material. Questions that connect to students' existing interests, that present puzzles or controversies, or that invite personal response can be more engaging than abstract or detached formulations.

This emphasis on motivation is not a concession to entertainment; it recognises that genuine historical thinking requires intellectual effort, and that students are more likely to invest that effort when they are engaged by the question. The challenge for teachers is to frame questions that are both engaging and rigorous.

**Manageability and Focus**

Enquiry questions must be manageable within the time and resources available. Riley cautions against questions that are so broad or complex that they cannot be adequately addressed within a single unit or lesson. At the same time, questions must not be so narrow that they fail to develop significant historical understanding.

The art of designing enquiry questions involves finding the right level of focus—questions that are sufficiently specific to be manageable, but sufficiently open to allow for genuine historical investigation. Riley's article provides practical guidance on achieving this balance.

**Accessibility**

Enquiry questions should be accessible to the students who will engage with them. This does not mean that questions should be simple; rather, it means that students should be able to understand what is being asked and to see how they might go about answering it. Questions that rely on sophisticated prior knowledge or that use technical language inaccessible to students may fail to drive effective learning.

Riley emphasises that accessibility is achieved through careful wording of the question and through appropriate scaffolding of the enquiry process. The question itself should be clear and direct, while the resources and activities that support the enquiry provide the necessary contextual knowledge and procedural guidance.

### The Garden Metaphor

The extended metaphor of the "history garden" provides a memorable and productive framework for thinking about curriculum design. Riley invites teachers to see themselves as gardeners, actively cultivating their curriculum rather than simply implementing prescribed content. This metaphor has several implications:

- **Active selection**: Just as gardeners select which plants to grow, teachers must select which enquiries to pursue. Not all possible enquiries can be included; choices must be made based on criteria of significance, interest, and coherence.

- **Cultivation over time**: Gardens develop over time; they are not created in a single season. Similarly, enquiry questions should be seen as part of a developing curriculum, with connections and sequences that build students' understanding across Key Stage 3.

- **Attention to conditions**: Different plants thrive in different conditions. Similarly, different enquiry questions may be appropriate for different contexts—different groups of students, different time allocations, different resource availability.

- **Active maintenance**: Gardens require ongoing attention—planting, weeding, watering. Curriculum design is not a one-off activity but requires ongoing attention and refinement.

The garden metaphor has proven remarkably durable, continuing to inform discussions of curriculum design more than two decades after its introduction. It captures something important about the craft of history teaching: the combination of practical skill, aesthetic judgment, and ongoing attention that effective curriculum design requires.

## Teaching Emotive and Controversial History

### Collaboration with Jamie Byrom

Riley's collaboration with Jamie Byrom has produced some of the most influential work on teaching emotive and controversial history. Their joint publications, including the 2007 article "Professional Wrestling in the History Department: A Case Study in Planning the Teaching of the British Empire at Key Stage 3" and the 2007 article "Identity-Shakers: Cultural Encounters and the Development of Pupils' Multiple Identities," have shaped thinking about how to approach difficult and sensitive topics in the history classroom.

Byrom and Riley's work addresses a fundamental challenge in history education: many of the most important topics in history are also the most emotionally charged and politically controversial. The slave trade, the British Empire, the Holocaust, religious conflict—these topics are essential to understanding the past, but they can be difficult to teach well. Poorly taught, they can reinforce prejudice, traumatise students, or descend into simplistic moralising.

### Principles for Teaching Controversial History

Riley and Byrom articulate principles for teaching emotive and controversial history that have been widely adopted:

**Historical Contextualisation**

Controversial topics should be taught historically, with attention to the contexts in which events occurred and the perspectives of historical actors. This does not mean endorsing past practices or perspectives, but it does mean understanding them in their own terms before making judgments.

Riley emphasises that historical contextualisation is not a matter of "excusing" past actions but of understanding them. Students need to understand why people in the past acted as they did, what beliefs and values shaped their actions, and what alternatives were available to them. This understanding provides the foundation for informed moral judgment.

**Multiple Perspectives**

Effective teaching of controversial topics requires engaging with multiple perspectives. This includes the perspectives of different groups affected by historical events, as well as the perspectives of historians who have interpreted those events differently. Students should understand that historical questions are contested and that different interpretations may be valid.

Riley's work emphasises that engaging with multiple perspectives is not merely a matter of "balancing" different views but of understanding how different perspectives illuminate different aspects of the past. The goal is not to leave students confused about what to believe, but to develop their capacity to evaluate historical claims critically.

**Emotional Engagement**

Riley argues that teaching emotive history should engage students' emotions, not seek to suppress them. History that matters—history that addresses questions of identity, justice, and human experience—will naturally evoke emotional responses. The task for teachers is to channel these emotions productively, using them to deepen historical understanding rather than allowing them to overwhelm critical thinking.

This approach recognises that emotional engagement can be a resource for learning. When students care about the past—when they are moved by the experiences of historical actors—they are more likely to invest the intellectual effort required for historical understanding. At the same time, teachers must ensure that emotional engagement does not collapse into uncritical identification or anachronistic judgment.

**Identity and Citizenship**

Riley and Byrom's work addresses the relationship between history teaching and students' developing identities. They recognise that students bring their own identities—cultural, religious, national—to the history classroom, and that these identities shape how they encounter the past. Rather than seeking to bracket identity, effective teaching engages with it, helping students to develop complex, multiple identities that can accommodate diverse perspectives.

The concept of "identity-shakers"—historical encounters that challenge and complicate students' sense of identity—captures this approach. Rather than seeking to reinforce a single national or cultural identity, Riley advocates for teaching that opens up possibilities for identification, helping students to see themselves in relation to diverse pasts and diverse presents.

## Curriculum Development: Think Through History and Enquiring History

### Think Through History

Riley was a key figure in the development of the *Think Through History* series, published by Longman in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This series of textbooks for Key Stage 3 embodied the enquiry-based approach that Riley advocated, organising content around enquiry questions and providing resources for active student engagement.

The *Think Through History* series was distinctive in several respects:

- **Enquiry structure**: Each unit was organised around an enquiry question, with resources and activities designed to support students in answering that question.

- **Narrative and activity**: The series combined narrative accounts of the past with activities that required students to engage actively with the material.

- **Development of historical skills**: Activities were designed to develop specific historical skills and understanding, not merely to occupy students.

- **Accessibility**: The series was designed to be accessible to students of different abilities, with appropriate challenge and support built in.

### Enquiring History

Riley and Jamie Byrom served as Series Editors for the *Enquiring History* series, published by Hodder Education. This series, designed for A-level students, extended the enquiry-based approach to post-16 education. Titles in the series included *The Crusades: Conflict and Controversy, 1095-1291* and *The Transformation of China, 1900-2000*.

The *Enquiring History* series was designed to support the new A-level specifications introduced in 2015, which placed greater emphasis on historical thinking and independent study. The series provided:

- **Rigorous enquiry questions**: Each chapter was organised around questions that required genuine historical thinking

- **Academic grounding**: The series engaged with current historical scholarship, introducing students to historiographical debates

- **Source work**: Extensive use of primary sources, with guidance on how to analyse and evaluate them

- **Essay preparation**: Support for developing the extended writing skills required at A-level

### OCR GCSE History SHP Series

Riley and Byrom also authored textbooks for the OCR GCSE History Specification B (SHP), including titles on *Living under Nazi Rule 1933-1945*, *Crime and Punishment c.1250 to Present*, and *The People's Health c.1250 to Present*. These textbooks applied enquiry-based approaches to GCSE study, supporting students in developing the conceptual understanding required for success at this level.

The OCR SHP series was significant in maintaining the Schools History Project approach at GCSE, ensuring that enquiry-based learning was not abandoned as students moved towards formal examinations. The textbooks demonstrated that rigorous historical thinking and examination preparation were not incompatible.

## Connection to the Schools History Project

### SHP Influence

Michael Riley's work has been deeply influenced by the Schools History Project (SHP). The enquiry-based approach that characterises his writing and curriculum materials reflects the SHP tradition, which emphasises learning history through investigation rather than through transmission of received knowledge.

Riley's work can be seen as a development and extension of the SHP approach. Where the original SHP materials established the principle of enquiry-based learning, Riley's work has focused on the craft of designing effective enquiries—the specific questions, resources, and activities that enable students to engage productively with the past.

### Contributing to SHP Development

Riley has contributed to the ongoing development of the Schools History Project through his writing, his curriculum development work, and his involvement in SHP activities. His work on teaching controversial history, in particular, has addressed challenges that the SHP approach faces when dealing with sensitive topics.

The SHP's emphasis on engagement with historical sources and with multiple perspectives creates particular challenges when dealing with topics such as the slave trade or the Holocaust. Riley's work on teaching emotive history has provided frameworks for addressing these challenges while maintaining the SHP commitment to rigorous historical thinking.

## Teacher Education and Professional Development

### PGCE and Initial Teacher Education

Riley has been involved in initial teacher education, contributing to PGCE programmes and working with beginning teachers to develop their practice. His approach to teacher education emphasises the development of practical craft knowledge—the specific skills and judgments required to design and implement effective history lessons.

Riley's writing for *Teaching History* has been particularly influential in teacher education. Articles such as "Into the Key Stage 3 History Garden" are routinely included in PGCE reading lists, introducing beginning teachers to the principles of enquiry-based curriculum design. The practical, classroom-focused nature of Riley's writing makes it accessible to beginning teachers while also offering insights to experienced practitioners.

### Professional Development Courses

Riley has been a regular contributor to professional development courses offered by the Historical Association and other organisations. His sessions on enquiry-based learning, teaching controversial history, and curriculum design have influenced the practice of thousands of history teachers.

These professional development activities have allowed Riley to disseminate his ideas beyond his written publications, working directly with teachers to develop their practice. The combination of written resources and face-to-face professional development has maximised the impact of his work.

### The T.E.A.C.H. Online Resource

Riley has contributed to the Historical Association's T.E.A.C.H. (Training, Education and CPD for History) online resource. This includes video materials in which Riley discusses teaching emotive and controversial history at Key Stage 3, providing practical guidance for teachers facing these challenges.

The T.E.A.C.H. resource exemplifies Riley's commitment to making high-quality professional development accessible to all history teachers, not only those who can attend face-to-face courses. The online format allows teachers to access Riley's insights at times and places that suit them, supporting ongoing professional development.

## International Influence

### UNESCO and Council of Europe

Riley and Jamie Byrom's work has had international influence through their contributions to UNESCO and Council of Europe projects focused on understanding and teaching about the historical relationship between Europe and the Islamic world. These projects have sought to develop resources and approaches that promote intercultural understanding through history education.

The Crusades has been a particular focus of this international work. As a topic that lies at the intersection of European and Islamic history, and that continues to resonate in contemporary geopolitics, the Crusades presents both opportunities and challenges for history education. Riley and Byrom's work on teaching this topic has sought to develop approaches that are historically rigorous while also promoting mutual understanding.

### EuroClio

Riley has been involved with EuroClio (the European Association of History Educators), contributing to projects that develop history education across Europe. This international work has extended the influence of Riley's approaches beyond England, contributing to the development of enquiry-based history teaching in diverse national contexts.

## Key Publications

### "Into the Key Stage 3 History Garden: Choosing and Planting Your Enquiry Questions" (2000)

Published in *Teaching History* 99, this article remains Riley's most influential single publication. It articulates the principles of effective enquiry question design and introduces the "history garden" metaphor that has shaped discussions of curriculum design for more than two decades.

### "Professional Wrestling in the History Department: A Case Study in Planning the Teaching of the British Empire at Key Stage 3" (2003)

Co-authored with Jamie Byrom and published in *Teaching History* 112, this article presents a detailed case study of planning to teach the British Empire. It exemplifies Riley's approach to teaching emotive and controversial history, demonstrating how rigorous historical thinking can be combined with engagement with difficult questions of identity and legacy.

### "Identity-Shakers: Cultural Encounters and the Development of Pupils' Multiple Identities" (2007)

Co-authored with Jamie Byrom and published in *Teaching History* 127, this article develops the concept of "identity-shakers"—historical encounters that challenge and complicate students' sense of identity. The article argues for history teaching that opens up possibilities for identification rather than seeking to reinforce singular identities.

### Think Through History Series (1998-2001)

Riley was a key author in this series of Key Stage 3 textbooks, published by Longman. The series embodied enquiry-based approaches to history teaching, organising content around rigorous enquiry questions and providing resources for active student engagement.

### Enquiring History Series (2012-2015)

As Series Editor (with Jamie Byrom) and author, Riley contributed to this A-level textbook series published by Hodder Education. The series extended enquiry-based approaches to post-16 education, supporting students in developing the historical thinking required for A-level study.

### OCR GCSE History SHP Series (2016-2018)

Riley co-authored several titles in this GCSE textbook series, applying enquiry-based approaches to the OCR Specification B (SHP). The series demonstrated that rigorous historical thinking and examination preparation could be effectively combined.

## Pedagogical Distinctiveness

### The Craft of History Teaching

Riley's work is distinctive in its attention to the craft of history teaching—the specific skills and judgments required to design and implement effective lessons. While some educational writing operates at a high level of abstraction, Riley's work is consistently practical, addressing the concrete decisions that teachers must make.

This attention to craft is evident in Riley's detailed treatment of enquiry question design. Rather than simply advocating for enquiry-based learning in general terms, he provides specific criteria for evaluating enquiry questions and practical guidance for designing them. This approach respects the professionalism of teachers, recognising that effective practice requires informed judgment rather than mere compliance with general principles.

### Balance of Principle and Practicality

Riley's work achieves a distinctive balance between educational principles and practical guidance. He is clear about the principles that should inform history teaching—the importance of rigorous historical thinking, the value of engaging with multiple perspectives, the need to address controversial topics—but he is equally clear about how these principles can be realised in practice.

This balance makes Riley's work valuable to teachers at different stages of their careers. Beginning teachers can find practical guidance that helps them get started, while experienced teachers can find principles that help them refine and develop their practice. The work rewards repeated reading, with new insights emerging as teachers' experience grows.

### Attention to Motivation and Engagement

Riley's work gives sustained attention to student motivation and engagement. He recognises that historical thinking requires intellectual effort, and that students are more likely to invest that effort when they are engaged by the material. His writing offers strategies for engaging students without sacrificing rigour—for finding enquiry questions that are both motivating and challenging.

This attention to motivation is particularly important in the context of teaching controversial history. Students are more likely to engage with difficult topics when they see their relevance to questions of identity, justice, and contemporary concerns. Riley's work shows how to harness this motivation productively, channelling it towards historical understanding rather than allowing it to collapse into uncritical identification.

## Relationship to Broader Traditions

### Connection to Counsell's Framework

Riley's work is deeply connected to Christine Counsell's curriculum framework. Both emphasise the importance of second-order concepts, the value of rigorous enquiry, and the need for careful curriculum design. Riley's work on enquiry questions can be seen as a practical development of Counsell's theoretical framework, providing specific guidance on how to implement the principles she articulates.

The connection is also evident in Riley's attention to what Counsell calls the "residue" of history education—the lasting understanding that remains with students after the details of specific topics have been forgotten. Riley's enquiry questions are designed to develop conceptual understanding that has lasting value, not merely to transmit factual information.

### Connection to Lee and Ashby's Research

Riley's practical work connects to the research tradition associated with Peter Lee and Rosalyn Ashby. The CHATA project's investigation of how students' historical understanding develops provides the research foundation for Riley's pedagogical approaches. Riley's enquiry questions are designed to engage students at appropriate levels of challenge, supporting their progression in understanding second-order concepts.

While Lee and Ashby focused primarily on research into student thinking, Riley has focused on translating these research insights into practical classroom strategies. The combination of research evidence and practical guidance has been powerful in shaping history education in England.

### Connection to the Historical Association

Riley has been a regular contributor to *Teaching History* throughout his career, and his work exemplifies the approach that the Historical Association has promoted. The journal's commitment to classroom-focused, practitioner-informed writing is reflected in Riley's contributions, which consistently address the practical challenges facing history teachers.

The Historical Association has recognised Riley's contribution through the publication of his work and through professional development activities. His involvement with T.E.A.C.H. online resources represents a significant contribution to the Association's mission of supporting history teachers.

## Legacy and Continuing Influence

### Impact on Classroom Practice

Michael Riley's work has had a direct impact on classroom practice across England. His enquiry-based approach, articulated through *Teaching History* articles and curriculum materials, has influenced how thousands of teachers design and implement their history curricula. The "history garden" metaphor has become part of the professional discourse of history education, routinely invoked in discussions of curriculum design.

The practical nature of Riley's writing has contributed to its impact. Teachers can take his insights directly into their practice, using his criteria for evaluating enquiry questions and his frameworks for teaching controversial history. This practical applicability distinguishes Riley's work from more theoretical contributions to history education.

### Influence on Curriculum Materials

Riley's influence extends through the curriculum materials he has developed. The *Think Through History* and *Enquiring History* series have reached thousands of students, embodying enquiry-based approaches in resources that teachers can use directly. These materials have demonstrated that enquiry-based learning can be realised in practical classroom resources, not merely advocated as an ideal.

### Influence on Teacher Education

Riley's work has been influential in teacher education, shaping how beginning history teachers learn to design curricula and plan lessons. His articles are standard reading on PGCE programmes, introducing beginning teachers to the principles of enquiry-based history teaching. The practical focus of his writing makes it particularly valuable for beginning teachers, who need concrete guidance as they develop their practice.

### Ongoing Relevance

Riley's work remains highly relevant to contemporary history education. The challenges he addressed—how to design rigorous enquiry questions, how to teach emotive and controversial history, how to engage students while maintaining historical integrity—remain central concerns for history teachers. His frameworks and criteria continue to provide valuable guidance for addressing these challenges.

As history education continues to evolve, with new curriculum requirements, new examination specifications, and new debates about the purposes of history education, Riley's work provides a foundation of principled practice. The specific examples and resources he developed may age, but the principles and approaches he articulated remain applicable across changing contexts.

## Conclusion

Michael Riley's contribution to history education in England is difficult to overstate. Through his writing for *Teaching History*, his curriculum development work, and his contributions to teacher education and professional development, he has shaped how history is taught in thousands of classrooms. His emphasis on rigorous enquiry questions, his frameworks for teaching emotive and controversial history, and his attention to the craft of history teaching have provided practical guidance that has improved the quality of history education.

Riley's work represents a distinctive approach to history education: one that combines rigorous historical thinking with attention to student motivation, that addresses controversial topics with sensitivity and integrity, and that respects the professionalism of teachers while offering practical support. This approach has proven remarkably durable, continuing to inform practice more than two decades after his most influential publications.

The influence of Riley's work extends through the teachers he has influenced, the students they have taught, and the curriculum materials that embody his approaches. His legacy is not merely a body of publications but a way of teaching history—an approach that values rigorous enquiry, respects students' capacity for historical thinking, and engages with the difficult questions that make history matter. As history education continues to evolve, Riley's work provides a foundation of principled practice that will continue to inform teaching for years to come.
