# Jamie Byrom: Teaching Emotive and Controversial History

## Introduction

Jamie Byrom stands as one of the leading figures in history education, particularly renowned for his work on teaching emotive and controversial history. Through his extensive writing, curriculum development, and professional development activities, Byrom has shaped how generations of history teachers approach difficult topics such as the British Empire, the slave trade, and the Holocaust. His collaborative work with Michael Riley on identity, empathy, and the teaching of challenging historical topics has been particularly influential, establishing frameworks that have become standard reference points for the profession.

Byrom's contribution extends across multiple domains: as a textbook author, including the widely-used *Enquiring History* series and OCR GCSE History SHP materials; as a curriculum developer working on innovative approaches to history teaching; as a provider of professional development through the Historical Association and other organisations; and as a writer whose articles in *Teaching History* have addressed some of the most challenging questions facing history educators. His work is characterised by deep engagement with both the practical demands of classroom teaching and the ethical and pedagogical complexities of teaching history that matters.

This profile examines Byrom's career and contributions, with particular attention to his work on teaching emotive and controversial history, his collaboration with Michael Riley, his textbook authorship, and his influence on how history teachers think about identity, empathy, and the purposes of history education.

## Early Career and Formation

### Teaching Background

Jamie Byrom began his career as a history teacher in comprehensive schools during the 1980s and 1990s. This practical classroom experience provided the foundation for his subsequent work as a writer and curriculum developer. Teaching in mixed-ability comprehensive schools during this formative period gave Byrom direct experience of the challenges and opportunities of making history accessible to all students.

The comprehensive school context was significant for Byrom's development. The movement towards comprehensive education had brought students of diverse backgrounds and abilities into the same classrooms, challenging teachers to develop approaches that could engage all learners. Byrom's work emerged from this commitment to inclusive history education—ensuring that history was not an elite subject for the few but a vital education for all.

### Connection to the South West

Byrom has maintained strong connections to the South West of England throughout his career. He taught in schools in the region and has been involved in supporting history teachers across the South West through local authority advisory work and professional development activities. This regional grounding has informed his understanding of the diverse contexts in which history teachers work, from urban comprehensive schools to rural community schools.

The South West context has also influenced Byrom's approach to local history and to making connections between the national story and regional experiences. His work often demonstrates how local histories can illuminate broader historical themes and how students' own places and communities can be starting points for historical enquiry.

## Collaboration with Michael Riley

### A Productive Partnership

Byrom's most influential work has been done in collaboration with Michael Riley. Their partnership has produced some of the most significant contributions to history education over the past two decades, including the landmark article "Professional Wrestling in the History Department" and the influential "Identity-Shakers" framework. This collaboration brings together complementary perspectives: Riley's expertise in curriculum design and enquiry questions with Byrom's deep engagement with the emotional and ethical dimensions of history teaching.

The Riley-Byrom collaboration exemplifies the value of sustained professional partnership in developing educational ideas. Rather than one-off contributions, their work represents an ongoing dialogue that has evolved over many years, addressing different aspects of history teaching while maintaining consistent underlying principles.

### "Professional Wrestling in the History Department" (2003)

The article "Professional Wrestling in the History Department: A Case Study in Planning the Teaching of the British Empire at Key Stage 3," published in *Teaching History* 112 in 2003, remains one of Byrom and Riley's most cited works. The provocative title captures the central argument: teaching emotive and controversial history involves engaging with conflict and emotion, not avoiding it.

The article uses the metaphor of professional wrestling to illuminate the challenges of teaching the British Empire. Just as professional wrestling involves staged conflict that audiences know is performed but engage with emotionally nonetheless, teaching emotive history involves creating opportunities for students to engage emotionally with the past while maintaining the boundaries that enable critical thinking.

The wrestling metaphor captures several important insights:

- **The role of emotion**: Teaching emotive history should engage students' emotions, not suppress them. The past matters because it evokes feelings—outrage, empathy, identification, resistance.

- **The importance of boundaries**: While emotions are engaged, teaching must maintain the boundary between past and present that enables critical historical thinking. Students should not simply identify with historical actors but should understand them in their context.

- **The performative dimension**: Teaching involves performance—the teacher stages encounters with the past that engage students. This is not inauthentic; it is the craft of making the past accessible.

- **The contractual nature**: The classroom involves an implicit contract where students know they are engaging with constructed encounters but commit to the emotional and intellectual engagement nonetheless.

The article presents a detailed case study of planning to teach the British Empire, demonstrating how these principles can be realised in practice. It has been widely influential in shaping how teachers approach this challenging topic.

### "Identity-Shakers" (2007)

The 2007 article "Identity-Shakers: Cultural Encounters and the Development of Pupils' Multiple Identities," published in *Teaching History* 127, developed the concept of "identity-shakers"—historical encounters that challenge and complicate students' sense of identity. This concept has been highly influential in shaping thinking about the relationship between history education and identity formation.

Byrom and Riley argue that effective history teaching should "shake" students' identities—not to destroy them but to open them up to complexity and multiplicity. Students should encounter histories that challenge their assumptions about who they are and how their community, nation, or culture fits into broader historical narratives.

The identity-shakers concept has several important implications:

- **History as destabilising**: Rather than reinforcing existing identities, history education should complicate them. Students should encounter perspectives that challenge their assumptions.

- **Multiple identities**: Students should develop multiple, flexible identities that can accommodate diverse perspectives. They should be able to see themselves in relation to different histories and different communities.

- **The role of encounter**: Identity development happens through encounter—with different perspectives, different experiences, different ways of understanding the world. History teaching creates opportunities for such encounters.

- **Ethical engagement**: Identity-shakers are not merely intellectual exercises; they engage students ethically, asking them to consider their responsibilities in relation to past injustices and their implications for the present.

The article has been widely cited and has informed approaches to teaching diverse histories, including the histories of empire, migration, and cultural encounter.

### Enquiring History Series

Byrom and Riley served as Series Editors for the *Enquiring History* series, published by Hodder Education for A-level students. This series extended their collaborative work to post-16 education, providing resources that embodied their principles of rigorous enquiry and engagement with challenging historical questions.

The *Enquiring History* series was designed to support the new A-level specifications introduced in 2015, which placed greater emphasis on historical thinking and independent study. Byrom and Riley's editorial vision ensured that the series maintained intellectual rigour while remaining accessible to students.

## Textbook Authorship and Curriculum Development

### OCR GCSE History SHP

Byrom has been a prolific author of textbooks for the OCR GCSE History Specification B (Schools History Project). These textbooks have made enquiry-based history teaching practicable for GCSE students, demonstrating that rigorous historical thinking and examination preparation are not incompatible.

Titles co-authored by Byrom include:

- *Living under Nazi Rule 1933-1945*
- *Crime and Punishment c.1250 to Present*
- *The People's Health c.1250 to Present*

These textbooks apply the principles of enquiry-based learning to GCSE study, supporting students in developing the conceptual understanding required for success at this level. They demonstrate Byrom's commitment to making rigorous history accessible to students of all abilities.

### International Curriculum Development

Byrom's work has extended beyond England to international curriculum development. He has been involved in projects developing history education in diverse contexts, bringing his expertise in teaching emotive and controversial history to educators facing different challenges and opportunities.

This international work has included contributions to UNESCO and Council of Europe projects focused on understanding and teaching about the historical relationship between Europe and the Islamic world. These projects have sought to develop resources and approaches that promote intercultural understanding through history education.

The Crusades has been a particular focus of this international work. As a topic that lies at the intersection of European and Islamic history, and that continues to resonate in contemporary geopolitics, the Crusades presents both opportunities and challenges for history education. Byrom's work on teaching this topic has sought to develop approaches that are historically rigorous while also promoting mutual understanding.

## Teaching Emotive and Controversial History

### The Ethical Dimension

Byrom's work is distinguished by its attention to the ethical dimension of history teaching. He recognises that teaching emotive topics is not merely a pedagogical challenge but an ethical one. How we teach the slave trade, the British Empire, or the Holocaust involves questions about how we remember, what we owe to the past, and what responsibilities we have in the present.

This ethical engagement is not about imposing particular moral conclusions on students. Rather, it is about creating opportunities for students to engage ethically with the past—to consider questions of justice, responsibility, and identity. Byrom's approach respects students' capacity for ethical reasoning while also recognising that such reasoning needs to be informed by historical understanding.

### The Role of Empathy

Byrom has written extensively on the role of empathy in history teaching. His approach to empathy is nuanced, recognising both its importance and its dangers. Historical empathy—understanding past actors in their own terms—is essential to historical understanding. But empathy can also lead to uncritical identification, anachronistic judgment, or the erasure of difference.

Byrom's framework for teaching with empathy involves:

- **Contextual understanding**: Students must understand the contexts in which historical actors operated before they can empathise with them.

- **Multiple perspectives**: Students should encounter multiple perspectives on historical events, not just those of the powerful or the victorious.

- **Critical distance**: While engaging emotionally, students must maintain the critical distance that enables them to analyse and evaluate.

- **Ethical reflection**: Empathy should lead to ethical reflection about the implications of historical events for the present.

### Dealing with Emotion

Byrom recognises that teaching emotive history will evoke emotional responses from students. The question is not whether to engage emotions but how to channel them productively. His work provides frameworks for:

- **Creating safe space**: Students need to feel safe to express emotional responses and to engage with challenging material.

- **Validating emotion**: Emotional responses are valid and should be acknowledged, not dismissed as irrelevant to historical study.

- **Channelling towards understanding**: Emotions should be channelled towards deeper historical understanding, not allowed to overwhelm critical thinking.

- **Supporting those who struggle**: Some students may find emotive material particularly challenging and need additional support.

## Professional Development and Influence

### Historical Association Contributions

Byrom has been a regular contributor to Historical Association professional development activities. His sessions on teaching emotive and controversial history, on identity and empathy, and on curriculum design have influenced the practice of thousands of history teachers.

These professional development activities have allowed Byrom to disseminate his ideas beyond his published work, working directly with teachers to develop their practice. The combination of written resources and face-to-face professional development has maximised the impact of his work.

### Influence on Classroom Practice

Byrom's work has had direct impact on classroom practice across England. Teachers use his frameworks for teaching emotive history, his approaches to identity and empathy, and his resources for teaching challenging topics. The practical nature of his writing makes it accessible to teachers, who can take his insights directly into their classrooms.

The influence is evident in how teachers now approach topics such as the British Empire and the slave trade. Where earlier generations might have avoided the emotional dimensions of these topics or taught them in detached, abstract ways, contemporary teachers following Byrom's approach engage with the emotional and ethical dimensions while maintaining historical rigour.

## Relationship to Other Key Thinkers

### Connection to Michael Riley

Byrom's work is deeply connected to Michael Riley's contributions to history education. Their collaboration has produced some of the most influential work on teaching emotive and controversial history. While Riley focused particularly on enquiry questions and curriculum design, Byrom brought expertise in the emotional and ethical dimensions of history teaching. Together, they developed frameworks that integrate these perspectives.

The Riley-Byrom partnership exemplifies how collaboration can generate insights that exceed what individuals could achieve alone. Their sustained dialogue over many years has produced a body of work that is coherent, cumulative, and influential.

### Connection to Christine Counsell

Byrom's work aligns with Christine Counsell's curriculum framework in its emphasis on rigorous historical thinking and its recognition of the importance of engaging with challenging historical questions. Counsell's concept of the "residue"—the lasting understanding that remains with students—connects to Byrom's concern with how encounters with emotive history shape students' identities and perspectives.

Both Byrom and Counsell recognise that history education should challenge students, should engage them with questions that matter, and should leave them with more than factual knowledge. The "identity-shakers" concept articulates this vision in terms of identity formation, showing how history education can transform how students see themselves and their world.

### Connection to the Schools History Project

Byrom's work is aligned with the Schools History Project (SHP) approach, particularly in its emphasis on enquiry-based learning and engagement with historical sources. The SHP's commitment to making history accessible to all students and to engaging them in genuine historical thinking underpins Byrom's work on teaching emotive history.

The SHP provided the context within which Byrom's ideas about emotive history teaching could be developed and disseminated. The project's network of teachers and its focus on innovative pedagogy created a receptive audience for Byrom's contributions.

## Key Publications

### "Professional Wrestling in the History Department" (2003)

Co-authored with Michael Riley and published in *Teaching History* 112, this article uses the metaphor of professional wrestling to illuminate the challenges of teaching emotive and controversial history. It presents a case study of teaching the British Empire and has been widely influential in shaping approaches to this topic.

### "Identity-Shakers" (2007)

Co-authored with Michael Riley and published in *Teaching History* 127, this article develops the concept of "identity-shakers"—historical encounters that challenge and complicate students' sense of identity. The article argues for history teaching that opens up possibilities for identification rather than reinforcing singular identities.

### Enquiring History Series (2012-2015)

As Series Editor (with Michael Riley) and author, Byrom contributed to this A-level textbook series. The series extended enquiry-based approaches to post-16 education, supporting students in developing the historical thinking required for A-level study.

### OCR GCSE History SHP Series (2016-2018)

Byrom co-authored several titles in this GCSE textbook series, applying enquiry-based approaches to the OCR Specification B (SHP). The series demonstrated that rigorous historical thinking and examination preparation could be effectively combined.

## Legacy and Continuing Influence

### Shaping Professional Discourse

Byrom's work has shaped how the history teaching profession thinks about emotive and controversial history. Concepts such as "identity-shakers" and the "professional wrestling" metaphor have become part of the professional vocabulary, routinely invoked in discussions of how to teach challenging topics.

This influence on professional discourse matters because it shapes how teachers conceptualise their practice. Teachers who think in terms of identity-shakers and professional wrestling approach their teaching differently than those who lack these frameworks.

### Supporting Teachers of Challenging Topics

Byrom's work has been particularly valuable for teachers who must teach emotive and controversial topics. The frameworks and approaches he has developed provide guidance for navigating the ethical and pedagogical complexities of teaching the slave trade, the British Empire, the Holocaust, and other difficult histories.

This practical support has been essential as history curricula have increasingly included these challenging topics. Teachers who might otherwise have felt uncertain about how to approach emotive material have found in Byrom's work both principles to guide them and practical strategies to implement.

### Contributing to Curriculum Development

Byrom's work has influenced curriculum development beyond individual classrooms. His frameworks have informed the design of curriculum specifications, textbook series, and professional development programmes. The integration of his approaches into these broader structures ensures that his influence extends to teachers who may not have read his articles directly.

## Conclusion

Jamie Byrom's contribution to history education is substantial and distinctive. His work on teaching emotive and controversial history has provided frameworks that have shaped how generations of teachers approach challenging topics. His collaboration with Michael Riley produced some of the most influential articles in the history of *Teaching History*, establishing concepts and metaphors that have become part of the professional vocabulary.

Byrom's work exemplifies the integration of ethical engagement with rigorous historical thinking. He has shown that history education can and should address questions that matter—questions of identity, justice, and responsibility—while maintaining the disciplinary standards that distinguish historical study from other forms of engagement with the past.

The enduring value of Byrom's work lies in its combination of principle and practicality. His writing offers both frameworks for thinking about history teaching and concrete strategies for classroom implementation. Teachers can take his insights into their classrooms immediately while also finding in his work resources for ongoing reflection and development.

As history education continues to face questions about what to teach, how to teach it, and why it matters, Byrom's work provides a foundation of principled practice. His commitment to teaching history that engages students emotionally and ethically, while also developing their capacity for rigorous historical thinking, remains as relevant today as when his most influential articles were first published.
