# Rosalyn Ashby

## Biography and Academic Background

Rosalyn Ashby is a prominent British history education researcher and academic who has made significant contributions to understanding how children learn historical thinking. She is a Lecturer at the UCL Institute of Education (formerly University of London Institute of Education), where she has worked closely with Professor Peter Lee, one of the leading figures in history education research. Ashby's career has combined academic research with practical involvement in teacher education and curriculum development, giving her work a distinctive character that bridges theory and classroom practice.

Before joining the Institute of Education, Ashby worked with the Essex Development and Advisory Service, where she gained direct experience working with schools and teachers. This practical grounding has informed her research, ensuring that her theoretical frameworks remain connected to the realities of classroom teaching. Her work has been particularly influential in shaping understanding of progression in historical thinking among primary and secondary school pupils.

## The CHATA Project: Concepts of History and Teaching Approaches

Ashby's most significant contribution to history education research came through her involvement with **Project CHATA** (Concepts of History and Teaching Approaches: 7 to 14), a major research initiative funded by the Economic and Social Science Research Council as part of the 'Innovation and Change: the Quality of Teaching and Learning' Programme. The project, conducted throughout the 1990s in collaboration with Peter Lee and Alaric Dickinson, represented one of the most comprehensive investigations into children's developing understanding of historical concepts ever undertaken in the United Kingdom.

The central objective of CHATA was to examine how students' ideas about history change over time, specifically focusing on the age range 7 to 14. The research team conducted extensive interviews with hundreds of children, exploring their understanding of key historical concepts including evidence, cause, change, and empathy. The findings from this project have fundamentally shaped subsequent thinking about progression in history education and have directly informed the National Curriculum and various assessment frameworks.

### First-Order and Second-Order Concepts

One of the most influential theoretical contributions emerging from CHATA, articulated by Lee and Ashby, is the distinction between **first-order substantive concepts** and **second-order procedural concepts**. First-order concepts are "what history is about"—the substantive content including events, periods, and phenomena such as the Roman Empire, the Industrial Revolution, or the abolition of slavery. Second-order concepts, by contrast, are "the way we go about doing history"—the disciplinary procedures that historians use including evidence, cause, consequence, change and continuity, similarity and difference, historical significance, and perspective-taking.

This distinction has profound implications for teaching and assessment. Rather than defining students' progress in history by measuring how much factual knowledge they accumulate, Lee and Ashby argued that progression should be measured by the increasingly sophisticated ways that students understand and use second-order concepts. A student who can memorise dates and facts but cannot evaluate sources or explain causes is not demonstrating historical understanding, however extensive their substantive knowledge may be.

## Understanding Historical Evidence

Ashby's individual research has focused particularly on students' understanding of historical evidence. Her seminal chapter "Students' Approaches to Validating Historical Claims" (2005), published in *Understanding History: Recent Research in History Education*, provides a detailed analysis of how students think about the relationship between historical sources and the claims historians make about the past.

### The Challenge of "Face-Value" History

Ashby identified a persistent challenge in history education: students' propensity to treat history as a copy of the past and historical sources as "face-value" information. Many students approach historical sources as direct windows onto the past, failing to recognise that sources are partial, constructed for particular purposes, and require interpretation. This "face-value" approach represents a significant barrier to developing historical thinking.

In her research, Ashby found that students' ideas about evidence typically progress through several stages:

**1. The Copy Theory**
At the most basic level, students see historical sources as straightforward copies of the past. They believe that sources simply tell us what happened, without recognising that sources are created by people with particular perspectives and purposes. Students at this level struggle to understand why sources might conflict or why historians might disagree.

**2. The Testimony Theory**
At an intermediate level, students begin to recognise that sources represent someone's viewpoint, but they still treat this testimony as relatively straightforward evidence. They may understand that a source is biased, but they respond by simply discarding it rather than using an awareness of perspective as a tool for interpretation. Students at this level often search for "unbiased" sources, not yet understanding that all sources have perspectives and that these perspectives can be analysed rather than simply avoided.

**3. The Evidence Theory**
At the most sophisticated level, students understand that sources provide evidence that must be interrogated and interpreted. They recognise that all sources have limitations but that these limitations do not make sources useless. Instead, understanding a source's perspective, purpose, and context becomes part of the process of using it as evidence. Students at this level can weigh different sources against each other, evaluate their reliability for particular purposes, and construct arguments that draw appropriately on the available evidence.

### Developing a Concept of Historical Evidence

Ashby's research emphasised that developing a concept of historical evidence is not simply a matter of accumulating more facts about sources. Instead, it involves a fundamental shift in how students understand the relationship between sources, claims about the past, and historical knowledge itself. This development is supported by providing students with structured opportunities to analyse primary sources, engage in historical inquiry, and construct historical arguments.

According to Ashby, if history education is to include an understanding of history as a discipline, then central to that understanding is a concept of evidence. The concept of evidence supports our ability to make claims based on information sources about the past. Without this conceptual understanding, students cannot genuinely engage in historical thinking, however much factual knowledge they acquire.

## Empathy, Perspective Taking, and Rational Understanding

Another major area of Ashby's research, conducted in collaboration with Peter Lee, concerns historical empathy and perspective taking. Their influential chapter "Empathy, Perspective Taking, and Rational Understanding" (2001), published in *Historical Empathy and Perspective Taking in the Social Studies*, distinguished between different forms of understanding the past and argued for a conception of empathy rooted in rational understanding rather than emotional identification.

### Critique of Emotional Empathy

Lee and Ashby critiqued approaches to empathy that focus primarily on emotional identification with historical actors. While feeling what historical figures felt might seem like a form of understanding, they argued that this approach is problematic for several reasons. First, it is epistemologically questionable—how can we know what people in the past felt? Second, it can lead to anachronistic projection, where students simply imagine themselves in historical situations without understanding how people's beliefs, values, and frameworks of meaning differed from our own. Third, emotional empathy does not necessarily lead to genuine understanding of historical actions and beliefs.

### Rational Understanding as the Goal

Instead of emotional empathy, Lee and Ashby argued for **rational understanding** as the goal of history education. Rational understanding involves comprehending why historical actors believed what they believed and acted as they did, given their circumstances, knowledge, values, and worldview. This form of understanding does not require agreeing with historical actors or sharing their feelings, but it does require taking seriously the different ways in which people in the past made sense of their world.

Ashby and Lee identified a six-level progression in students' capacity for rational understanding of the past:

**Level 1: Egocentric Projection**
Students explain historical actions entirely in terms of their own values and experiences. They cannot recognise that people in the past might have thought differently from themselves. For example, they might explain why people believed in witchcraft by saying "they weren't very clever" or "they didn't have proper schools."

**Level 2: Exotic Projection**
Students recognise that people in the past thought differently but characterise this difference as simply strange or irrational. They might say "people in those days were really weird" or "they didn't know any better." While this represents a recognition of difference, it does not constitute understanding because students cannot explain why people held the beliefs they did.

**Level 3: Unexplained Difference**
Students recognise that people in the past had different beliefs and values but cannot explain why. They acknowledge that people believed in witchcraft, for example, but cannot explain what made this belief reasonable or compelling within its historical context.

**Level 4: Contextualised Explanation**
Students begin to explain historical beliefs and actions in terms of the information and circumstances available to historical actors. They can explain, for example, that people believed in witchcraft because of the evidence they encountered—strange occurrences that seemed to confirm supernatural powers—or because of the authority figures who promoted such beliefs.

**Level 5: Framework Understanding**
Students understand that historical actors operated within different frameworks of meaning and belief. They can explain not just why individual people held particular beliefs but how entire worldviews structured how people understood their experiences. This involves understanding that different societies have different assumptions about how the world works.

**Level 6: Critical Evaluation**
At the most sophisticated level, students can not only understand historical frameworks but also critically evaluate them. They can recognise that historical actors' beliefs were reasonable given their frameworks while also recognising the limitations or problems with those frameworks. This involves holding two perspectives simultaneously—the historical actor's perspective and a critical perspective that recognises what the historical actor could not.

### Implications for Teaching

Ashby's research on empathy has significant implications for classroom practice. Teachers should avoid activities that simply ask students to imagine how they would feel in historical situations, which encourages egocentric projection. Instead, they should provide students with sources that reveal how historical actors understood their world, scaffold analysis of these sources, and explicitly teach the frameworks of belief that shaped historical actions. The goal is not for students to feel what historical figures felt but to understand why they acted as they did given their circumstances and beliefs.

## Progression in Historical Understanding

Across her research, Ashby has consistently emphasised the importance of understanding **progression** in historical learning. Her work with the CHATA project demonstrated that students' ideas about history develop in predictable ways, moving from simpler to more sophisticated conceptions of historical concepts. This understanding of progression has important implications for curriculum design, teaching, and assessment.

### Development Over Time

Ashby's research traced how children's ideas about history develop between the ages of 7 and 14. She found that even young children are capable of genuine historical thinking when given appropriate opportunities, but that their understanding of historical concepts typically becomes more sophisticated as they mature and as they encounter more history education. This progression is not automatic, however—it depends on the quality of teaching and the opportunities students have to engage with historical inquiry.

### Teaching for Progression

Understanding progression helps teachers identify where students are in their conceptual development and design instruction that moves them forward. Rather than simply correcting students' misconceptions, teachers can recognise these misconceptions as stages in a developmental progression and provide experiences that help students construct more sophisticated understandings. For example, when students treat sources as straightforward copies of the past (the copy theory), teachers can provide conflicting sources and scaffold analysis that helps students recognise the need for interpretation.

## Influence on Curriculum and Assessment

Ashby's research has had substantial influence on history education policy and practice in England and internationally. Her work on progression informed the development of the National Curriculum for history and has shaped assessment frameworks including the use of levels to describe students' historical understanding. More recently, her insights have informed thinking about assessment without levels and the development of progression models that focus on conceptual understanding rather than arbitrary point scales.

### Assessment of Historical Thinking

Ashby's research suggests that effective assessment in history must go beyond testing factual recall to assess students' understanding of second-order concepts. This requires assessment tasks that present students with sources and historical problems and ask them to demonstrate their thinking. Such assessments are more complex to design and mark than factual tests, but they provide genuine insight into students' historical understanding.

### International Influence

While Ashby's research has been particularly influential in England, it has also informed history education internationally. Her work has been cited in curriculum documents and research studies across Europe, North America, and Australia. The CHATA project's findings about progression in historical understanding have been replicated and extended in various national contexts, confirming the broad applicability of the theoretical frameworks Ashby helped develop.

## Pedagogical Legacy

Rosalyn Ashby's work represents a rigorous, research-informed approach to understanding history education. Her contributions have helped establish that history is not merely a body of knowledge to be transmitted but a discipline with its own ways of thinking and knowing that can and should be taught to students from primary age onwards. Her research on evidence, empathy, and progression provides teachers with frameworks for understanding student learning and designing instruction that develops genuine historical thinking.

For teachers working in the classroom, Ashby's legacy lies in the clarity with which she has articulated what it means to think historically and in the practical insights her research provides for fostering such thinking in students. Her work continues to inform professional development, initial teacher education, and curriculum development, ensuring that rigorous historical thinking remains at the heart of history education in England and beyond.

## Classroom Applications

### Teaching Historical Evidence

Drawing on Ashby's research, teachers can:

- **Begin with sources, not narratives**: Start enquiries with historical sources rather than textbook accounts, requiring students to construct understanding from evidence.

- **Use conflicting sources deliberately**: Present students with sources that disagree, creating the cognitive conflict that drives development toward more sophisticated understandings of evidence.

- **Scaffold source analysis**: Provide frameworks and questions that help students move beyond face-value reading toward critical interrogation of sources.

- **Make the enquiry process visible**: Help students understand how historians use evidence to construct claims, modelling historical thinking explicitly.

### Teaching for Rational Understanding

To develop students' capacity for rational understanding of the past:

- **Provide contextual information**: Ensure students understand the circumstances, knowledge, and beliefs available to historical actors.

- **Use contemporary sources**: Work with sources that reveal how people in the past understood their world, not just sources that describe what happened.

- **Avoid presentism explicitly**: Teach students to recognise when they are judging the past by present standards and to suspend this judgement in favour of understanding.

- **Ask "why did they believe that?"**: Focus on explaining historical beliefs and actions in terms that historical actors would recognise, rather than simply labelling them wrong or strange.

### Planning for Progression

To build progression into curriculum planning:

- **Map conceptual development**: Identify where students are likely to be in their understanding of key concepts and plan sequences that move them forward.

- **Return to concepts repeatedly**: Ensure that second-order concepts are revisited across different historical contexts, allowing students to develop more sophisticated understanding over time.

- **Build increasingly complex enquiries**: Structure the curriculum so that enquiries become progressively more demanding in terms of the conceptual thinking required.

- **Assess understanding, not just recall**: Design assessments that reveal students' conceptual understanding rather than simply testing factual knowledge.

## Connections to Other Key Thinkers

Ashby's work connects closely with that of other prominent history education researchers:

**Peter Lee**: Ashby's long-term collaborator, with whom she developed the CHATA project and key theoretical frameworks about progression and historical thinking. Lee's work on historical literacy and the nature of historical knowledge complements Ashby's research on evidence and empathy.

**Denis Shemilt**: Another leading figure in history education research, Shemilt's work on students' understanding of historical accounts and interpretation aligns with Ashby's research on evidence.

**Sam Wineburg**: The American researcher whose work on historical thinking and "unnatural acts" parallels Ashby's research on how students learn to think historically. Both emphasise that historical thinking does not come naturally but must be taught.

**Christine Counsell**: Ashby's work on second-order concepts and progression has influenced Counsell's thinking about powerful knowledge and disciplinary literacy in history.
