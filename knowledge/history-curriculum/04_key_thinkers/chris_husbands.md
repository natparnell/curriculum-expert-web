# Chris Husbands: Evidence-Based History Education and Professional Knowledge

## Introduction

Chris Husbands stands as one of the most significant figures in history education research and teacher education in England over the past three decades. His work spans academic research, teacher education, policy development, and institutional leadership. As Director of the Institute of Education at the University of London (now UCL Institute of Education), he shaped one of the world's leading centres for educational research and teacher training. His contributions to understanding how history teachers develop professional knowledge, how research evidence can inform practice, and how history education policy evolves have had lasting impact on the field.

Husbands' work is distinctive for its commitment to evidence-based practice and its recognition of the complexity of teaching as a professional activity. Unlike some researchers who focus exclusively on either theoretical frameworks or practical techniques, Husbands has consistently sought to bridge these domains, demonstrating how research evidence can inform—but not determine—professional judgment. His writing on history education is characterised by conceptual clarity, empirical grounding, and respect for the expertise of practising teachers.

This profile examines Husbands' career trajectory, his research on history teachers' professional knowledge, his contributions to understanding historical learning, his work on assessment and progression, his involvement in policy development, and his institutional leadership. It also explores his relationship to other key figures in history education and his enduring influence on the field.

## Early Career and Formation

### Background and Education

Chris Husbands was educated at Cambridge University, where he studied History before proceeding to train as a teacher. His own experience as a history teacher in comprehensive schools during the 1980s provided the foundation for his subsequent academic career. This practical grounding in the realities of classroom teaching has informed all of his subsequent work; he has consistently maintained connections to schools and to the practical challenges facing history teachers.

The 1980s was a formative period for history education in England. The Schools History Project was gaining influence, demonstrating the potential of enquiry-based approaches. The introduction of the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) in 1986 was reshaping assessment at age 16. The National Curriculum was being developed, with history as one of the foundation subjects. Husbands' early career coincided with these developments, and his work has engaged with their implications throughout.

### The University of Warwick

Husbands' academic career began at the University of Warwick, where he established himself as a leading researcher in history education. At Warwick, he conducted research on how history teachers develop professional knowledge, investigating the relationship between academic history, educational theory, and classroom practice. This research addressed a fundamental question: what do history teachers need to know, and how do they develop that knowledge?

The Warwick context was significant for Husbands' development. The university's commitment to research-informed practice and its connections to schools in the West Midlands provided opportunities for empirical research that engaged with the realities of classroom teaching. Husbands' work at Warwick established the research themes that would characterise his subsequent career: the nature of professional knowledge in history teaching, the relationship between research and practice, and the development of teacher expertise.

### Director of the Institute of Education

In 2011, Husbands was appointed Director of the Institute of Education, University of London. Under his leadership, the Institute became the UCL Institute of Education following a merger with University College London in 2014. This appointment placed Husbands at the head of one of the world's leading institutions for educational research and teacher education.

The Institute of Education has been a centre for history education research since the 1990s, with Peter Lee and Rosalyn Ashby conducting the CHATA project there. Husbands' directorship consolidated this tradition, ensuring that the Institute remained at the forefront of history education research. His leadership also expanded the Institute's influence internationally, establishing partnerships and collaborations with institutions worldwide.

Husbands served as Director until 2017, when he became Vice-Chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University. In this role, he has continued to shape educational policy and practice, though his focus has broadened beyond history education to encompass higher education leadership and the wider educational landscape.

## Research on Teachers' Professional Knowledge

### The Nature of Professional Knowledge in History Teaching

Husbands' research has been centrally concerned with the question of what history teachers need to know and how they develop that knowledge. This research addresses a fundamental issue in teacher education: the relationship between subject knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and the knowledge that informs classroom practice.

In his influential 1996 article "What Do History Teachers Need to Know?" published in *Teaching History*, Husbands distinguished between different forms of knowledge relevant to history teaching:

- **Subject knowledge**: Knowledge of historical content, including substantive knowledge of periods, events, and processes, and conceptual knowledge of historical procedures and concepts.

- **Pedagogical knowledge**: Knowledge of general teaching strategies, classroom management, and assessment.

- **Pedagogical content knowledge**: The particular knowledge that connects subject matter to teaching—knowing how to represent historical ideas to learners, understanding what makes particular topics difficult or easy, and knowing the preconceptions students bring to the study of history.

Husbands argued that pedagogical content knowledge is the crucial category for history teachers. It is not enough to know history or to know generic teaching strategies; effective history teaching requires knowledge that is specific to history—knowing how to teach particular historical concepts, how to help students engage with sources, how to develop their understanding of cause and change.

### How Teachers Learn

Husbands' research has investigated how history teachers develop professional knowledge. This research has challenged assumptions that subject knowledge is simply acquired through academic study and then applied in the classroom. Instead, Husbands has shown that teachers develop professional knowledge through a complex process that involves reflection on practice, engagement with research, and dialogue with colleagues.

In his 2003 book with Anna Pendry and Kit Kitson, *Understanding History Teaching*, Husbands presented findings from research on how beginning history teachers develop their practice. The book traced the journey from novice to expert, identifying the challenges that beginning teachers face and the support that enables them to develop effective practice.

Key findings from this research include:

- **The importance of reflection**: Teachers develop through reflection on their practice, analysing what worked and what did not, and considering how to improve.

- **The role of mentor support**: Beginning teachers benefit from mentor support that goes beyond practical advice to engage with the principles underlying effective practice.

- **The development of pedagogical content knowledge**: Subject knowledge acquired through academic study must be transformed into pedagogical content knowledge—knowledge that is usable in the classroom.

- **The challenge of classroom management**: Beginning teachers often struggle with classroom management, and this can impede their development of subject-specific pedagogy.

### The Relationship Between Research and Practice

Husbands has been consistently concerned with the relationship between educational research and classroom practice. He has argued that research can and should inform practice, but that the relationship is complex. Research does not provide simple answers or recipes for teaching; rather, it offers evidence that teachers can use, alongside other sources of knowledge, to inform their professional judgment.

In his writing for *Teaching History*, Husbands has sought to make research accessible to teachers, translating academic findings into practical guidance while maintaining the integrity of the research. He has also argued for research that engages with the realities of classroom practice, recognising that research that ignores the constraints and complexities of teaching is unlikely to be useful.

Husbands' approach to research-informed practice is captured in his concept of "evidence-informed professionalism." Teachers are professionals who make judgments in complex situations; research evidence is one resource they can draw on, alongside their experience, their knowledge of their students, and their understanding of context. The goal is not to replace professional judgment with research findings, but to enrich that judgment with evidence.

## Historical Thinking and Learning

### What is Historical Understanding?

Husbands' work has engaged with fundamental questions about what it means to understand history. In his 1996 article "What is History Teaching For?" (co-authored with Anna Pendry), he explored the purposes of history education and the forms of understanding it should develop.

The article distinguished between different forms of historical understanding:

- **Knowledge of the past**: Knowing what happened, when, and to whom. This is necessary but not sufficient for historical understanding.

- **Understanding of historical processes**: Understanding how change happens, how societies develop, how events unfold. This involves grasping patterns and processes beyond particular events.

- **Understanding of historical procedures**: Understanding how historians work, how they use evidence, how they construct arguments. This involves second-order concepts such as evidence, cause, and change.

Husbands argued that history education should develop all three forms of understanding, but that the third—understanding of historical procedures—is often neglected. Students may acquire knowledge of the past without understanding how that knowledge is constructed or how historians work. This leaves them unable to evaluate historical claims or to think historically about new topics.

### Historical Thinking and Second-Order Concepts

Husbands' work connects to the broader tradition of research on second-order concepts associated with Peter Lee, Rosalyn Ashby, and Denis Shemilt. Like these researchers, Husbands has argued that historical understanding requires understanding of procedural concepts—evidence, cause, change, empathy, and significance—not merely substantive knowledge of the past.

In his 2002 article "Teaching and Learning History: Understanding the Past," published in the *International Journal of Historical Learning, Teaching and Research*, Husbands explored how these concepts can be taught. He argued that teaching for historical thinking requires:

- **Explicit attention to concepts**: Teachers need to make second-order concepts explicit, helping students to understand the nature of historical evidence, causation, and change.

- **Opportunities for application**: Students need opportunities to apply historical concepts to new material, developing their ability to think historically about unfamiliar topics.

- **Scaffolded support**: Developing historical thinking requires support. Teachers need to provide scaffolding that enables students to engage with challenging historical questions.

- **Assessment of conceptual understanding**: Assessment needs to target conceptual understanding, not merely factual recall. This requires tasks that require students to use historical concepts.

### Historical Imagination and Empathy

Husbands has written on the controversial topic of historical imagination and empathy. In his 1998 article "What is History Teaching For? Imagination, Moral Purpose and the Nature of the Past" (co-authored with Anna Pendry), he explored the role of imagination in historical understanding and the relationship between history education and moral development.

The article engaged with debates about historical empathy—whether it is possible, whether it is desirable, and how it should be taught. Husbands argued that historical imagination is essential to understanding the past; we cannot understand past societies without some capacity to imagine how they worked and how people experienced them. However, he also recognised the dangers of uncritical projection—of assuming that people in the past thought and felt as we do.

Husbands' position on empathy aligns with the framework developed by Peter Lee and Denis Shemilt. Historical understanding requires understanding past perspectives in their own terms, but this is a difficult achievement that requires knowledge, skill, and critical awareness. It is not a matter of simply "putting yourself in their shoes" but of using evidence to understand how people in the past made sense of their world.

## Assessment and Progression

### Understanding Progression in History

Husbands' work has addressed questions of assessment and progression in history education. How can we assess whether students are making progress in their historical understanding? What does progression look like in history?

In the 1990s, Husbands was involved in developing assessment frameworks for the National Curriculum. The original National Curriculum for History (1991) introduced attainment targets with ten levels, describing progression in terms of increasingly sophisticated historical skills. Husbands' research informed the development of these levels, ensuring that they reflected how students' historical understanding actually develops.

The levels described progression from simple identification and description (Level 1) through increasingly sophisticated analysis, evaluation, and synthesis (Levels 8-10). While the ten-level system was subsequently simplified, the underlying conception of progression—that students develop increasingly sophisticated understanding of historical concepts—informed subsequent curriculum frameworks.

### Assessing Historical Understanding

Husbands has been concerned with how to assess historical understanding validly. Traditional assessments often focus on factual recall, testing whether students remember names, dates, and events. While factual knowledge is important, such assessments do not capture students' understanding of historical concepts—their ability to use evidence, explain causation, or evaluate significance.

Valid assessment in history, Husbands argues, requires tasks that require students to think historically. This might involve:

- **Source analysis tasks**: Presenting students with historical sources and asking them to use them as evidence to answer a question.

- **Causal explanation tasks**: Asking students to explain why something happened, requiring them to identify causes and assess their relative importance.

- **Change and continuity tasks**: Asking students to characterise change over time, requiring them to identify what changed and what stayed the same.

- **Significance tasks**: Asking students to evaluate the significance of events, people, or developments, requiring them to apply criteria of significance.

Such tasks reveal students' conceptual understanding in ways that factual recall questions cannot. They also provide diagnostic information that teachers can use to plan instruction that addresses students' specific learning needs.

### The Role of Public Examinations

Husbands has written on the role of public examinations in shaping history education. Examinations at GCSE and A-level have significant influence on what is taught in schools, and Husbands has been concerned that examination specifications should support rather than undermine effective history teaching.

In his work with awarding bodies and regulatory authorities, Husbands has advocated for examination specifications that:

- **Assess conceptual understanding**: Questions should target students' understanding of historical concepts, not merely their factual recall.

- **Allow for genuine historical thinking**: Tasks should require students to engage in genuine historical thinking, using evidence to construct arguments.

- **Support breadth and depth**: Specifications should enable schools to teach a broad range of history while also allowing for depth of study.

- **Are accessible to all students**: Assessment should be designed to enable all students to demonstrate what they can do, not simply to differentiate between high-achieving students.

## Policy Development and Professional Leadership

### Involvement in Curriculum Development

Husbands has been involved in policy development and curriculum review throughout his career. His expertise has been sought by government bodies, awarding organisations, and professional associations.

In the 1990s, he was involved in the development of the National Curriculum for History, contributing to the specification of attainment targets and programmes of study. In the 2000s, he was involved in the review of the National Curriculum that led to the 2007 and later 2014 versions. In the 2010s, he contributed to the review of GCSE and A-level specifications.

This policy involvement has been significant in ensuring that research evidence informs curriculum and assessment policy. Husbands has consistently argued for policies that support rigorous historical education, resisting pressures to reduce history to factual recall or to narrow the curriculum.

### The Historical Association

Husbands has maintained close connections with the Historical Association throughout his career. He has been a regular contributor to *Teaching History*, the Association's journal for secondary history teachers, and has served on the Association's Council and committees.

The Historical Association has been a significant vehicle for Husbands' influence on the profession. Through the journal, through conferences, and through professional development activities, his ideas have reached thousands of history teachers. The Association's commitment to research-informed practice aligns with Husbands' own approach, making it a natural forum for his work.

### Leadership of the Institute of Education

As Director of the Institute of Education, Husbands shaped one of the world's leading centres for educational research and teacher education. His leadership consolidated the Institute's position as a centre for history education research, supporting the work of Peter Lee, Rosalyn Ashby, and other researchers.

Under Husbands' leadership, the Institute of Education:

- **Expanded its research activity**: The Institute's research income and output increased significantly, with new centres and programmes established.

- **Strengthened partnerships with schools**: The Institute deepened its partnerships with schools, ensuring that research and teacher education remained connected to practice.

- **Developed international influence**: The Institute expanded its international partnerships and collaborations, extending its influence beyond the UK.

- **Merged with UCL**: The merger with University College London created the UCL Institute of Education, positioning it within a leading research-intensive university.

Husbands' leadership demonstrated that academic research and professional practice can be effectively integrated within a single institution. The UCL Institute of Education under his direction was both a world-leading research centre and a major provider of teacher education, with each activity informing the other.

## Relationship to Other Key Thinkers

### Connection to the CHATA Research

Husbands' work is deeply connected to the CHATA (Concepts of History and Teaching Approaches) research conducted by Peter Lee, Rosalyn Ashby, and Denis Shemilt at the Institute of Education. The CHATA research mapped how students' understanding of second-order concepts develops, providing empirical foundations for thinking about progression in history education.

Husbands' contribution has been to translate these research findings into frameworks for teacher education and professional development. While Lee and Ashby focused on researching student learning, Husbands has focused on how teachers can use this research to inform their practice. His work on pedagogical content knowledge provides a framework for understanding what teachers need to know to teach for historical understanding.

### Connection to Michael Riley and Enquiry-Based Learning

Husbands' work connects to Michael Riley's contributions to enquiry-based learning. Riley's practical guidance on designing enquiry questions provides teachers with tools for implementing the approaches that Husbands' research supports. Both share a commitment to rigorous historical thinking and to the importance of engaging students in genuine historical enquiry.

Husbands' research on how teachers develop professional knowledge helps to explain why enquiry-based approaches can be challenging to implement. Teaching through enquiry requires sophisticated pedagogical content knowledge—knowledge of how to design enquiries, how to scaffold student learning, how to assess historical thinking. Husbands' work on teacher education addresses how this knowledge can be developed.

### Connection to Christine Counsell

Husbands' work aligns with Christine Counsell's curriculum framework. Both emphasise the importance of second-order concepts, the value of rigorous historical thinking, and the need for careful curriculum design. Counsell's concept of the "residue" of history education—the lasting understanding that remains with students—connects to Husbands' concern with developing historical understanding that persists beyond the details of specific topics.

The connection is also evident in their shared commitment to research-informed practice. Both Counsell and Husbands have sought to bridge the gap between research and practice, ensuring that insights from research inform curriculum design and classroom teaching.

## Legacy and Continuing Influence

### Impact on Teacher Education

Husbands' work has had a profound impact on how history teachers are educated. His framework for understanding teachers' professional knowledge has shaped initial teacher education programmes, ensuring that they address not only subject knowledge and generic teaching skills but also the specific pedagogical content knowledge required for history teaching.

The PGCE programme at the UCL Institute of Education, where Husbands was Director, exemplifies this approach. The programme integrates research on historical learning with practical classroom experience, supporting beginning teachers in developing the knowledge and skills required for effective history teaching.

### Impact on Educational Research

Husbands' research on teachers' professional knowledge has influenced educational research beyond history education. His framework for understanding pedagogical content knowledge has been applied in other subject areas, and his methodological approaches have informed research on teacher development.

As Director of the Institute of Education, Husbands shaped the research agenda in education, ensuring that research addressed questions of practical significance while maintaining rigorous methodological standards. His leadership consolidated the Institute's position as a world-leading centre for educational research.

### Impact on Policy

Husbands' involvement in policy development has ensured that research evidence informs educational policy. His contributions to the National Curriculum for History, to GCSE and A-level specifications, and to professional standards have shaped the policy landscape within which history teachers work.

This policy involvement reflects Husbands' commitment to the practical application of research. He has not been content to conduct research for its own sake; he has consistently sought to ensure that research findings inform policy and practice, improving the quality of history education for students.

### Enduring Themes

Several themes characterise Husbands' contribution and continue to be relevant to history education:

- **The importance of pedagogical content knowledge**: Effective history teaching requires knowledge that is specific to history—knowing how to teach historical concepts, how to help students engage with sources, how to develop historical thinking.

- **The value of research-informed practice**: Research evidence can inform professional judgment, enriching teachers' capacity to make informed decisions about their practice.

- **The complexity of teaching**: Teaching is a complex professional activity that cannot be reduced to simple recipes or techniques. It requires judgment, informed by evidence, experience, and knowledge of context.

- **The centrality of historical thinking**: The goal of history education is not merely to transmit knowledge about the past but to develop students' capacity to think historically—to use evidence, explain causation, understand change, and evaluate significance.

## Conclusion

Chris Husbands' contribution to history education spans research, teacher education, policy development, and institutional leadership. His work on teachers' professional knowledge has transformed how we understand what history teachers need to know and how they develop that knowledge. His research on historical learning has informed approaches to teaching and assessing historical understanding. His policy involvement has ensured that research evidence shapes curriculum and assessment frameworks.

Husbands' work exemplifies the integration of research and practice. He has not been content to conduct research for its own sake, nor has he advocated practice uninformed by evidence. Instead, he has consistently sought to bridge the gap between research and practice, demonstrating how each can inform the other.

The themes that characterise Husbands' work—the importance of pedagogical content knowledge, the value of research-informed practice, the complexity of teaching, and the centrality of historical thinking—continue to be relevant to history education. As the field evolves, these themes provide a foundation for thinking about how history should be taught and how history teachers should be educated.

Husbands' legacy is evident in the thousands of history teachers who have been educated in programmes shaped by his research, in the curriculum frameworks that reflect his contributions, and in the research tradition that he helped to establish. His work has improved the quality of history education in England and has influenced thinking internationally. As history education continues to face new challenges and opportunities, Husbands' contributions provide a foundation of evidence and insight that will continue to inform practice for years to come.
