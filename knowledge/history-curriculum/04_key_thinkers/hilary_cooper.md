# Hilary Cooper: Pioneer of Constructivist History Education

## Biography and Academic Background

Hilary Cooper is a distinguished British academic and one of the most influential figures in primary history education over the past four decades. Her career trajectory—from practising primary teacher to Emeritus Professor—exemplifies the powerful connection between classroom practice and academic research that has characterised her contribution to the field.

Cooper graduated with a B.A. (Hons) in European History from Royal Holloway College, London University, before completing her PGCE at the London University Institute of Education. She spent many years teaching in London primary schools, where she was drawn to the emerging constructivist and 'child-centred' educational philosophy that would later inform her academic work. Her experience in the classroom provided the foundation for her research interests and ensured that her subsequent theoretical contributions remained grounded in the realities of primary practice.

A pivotal moment in Cooper's development came when she was seconded to take an Advanced Diploma in Child Development. During this period, she discovered what she perceived as a significant gap: there was no coherent theoretical framework for teaching history to young children. This realisation prompted her to undertake doctoral research, culminating in her PhD thesis, *Young Children's Thinking in History* (1991), completed at the London University Institute of Education. This seminal work established her reputation as a leading researcher in primary history education and laid the groundwork for her subsequent contributions.

Following her doctorate, Cooper held several prestigious academic positions:
- **Lecturer in Primary Education** at Goldsmiths' College, London University (1989–1993)
- **Director of Professional Studies** at Lancaster University Department of Education (1993–1996)
- **Reader in Education, later Professor of History and Pedagogy** at St Martin's College, Lancaster (1997–2007)
- **Professor** at the University of Cumbria (2007–2011)
- **Emeritus Professor** (from 2011 to present)

Throughout her academic career, Cooper has maintained active connections with classroom practice, continuing to publish widely, speak at international conferences, and collaborate with practising teachers.

## Core Contribution: Understanding Young Children's Historical Thinking

Cooper's most significant contribution to history education lies in her groundbreaking research into how young children think historically. Her PhD thesis, *Young Children's Thinking in History*, represented one of the first systematic attempts to apply theories of cognitive development specifically to historical understanding in the primary years.

### Theoretical Framework

In her doctoral research, Cooper examined theories of cognitive development relevant to children's historical thinking, drawing on the work of several influential theorists:

**Jean Piaget's developmental psychology** provided a foundation for understanding how children's cognitive capacities evolve. However, Cooper was equally influenced by **Jerome Bruner's** work on the structure of knowledge and the spiral curriculum, which suggested that complex ideas could be introduced to young children in age-appropriate forms and revisited at increasing levels of sophistication.

**Benjamin Bloom's** taxonomy of educational objectives informed her thinking about the hierarchical nature of cognitive skills in history, whilst the work of **Keith Coltham and John Fines** (1971) on historical thinking in primary schools demonstrated that young children were capable of far more sophisticated historical reasoning than previously assumed.

**Pamela Rogers'** (1978) application of the work of Elton, Bruner, and Bloom to primary history teaching provided crucial insights that Cooper developed further in her own research. This synthesis of constructivist educational theory with history-specific pedagogy became the hallmark of her approach.

### Key Findings on Children's Historical Cognition

Cooper's research challenged prevalent assumptions about young children's cognitive limitations in relation to history. Her work demonstrated that:

1. **Young children can engage with abstract historical concepts** when these are presented through concrete experiences, stories, and artefacts. Concepts such as change, continuity, cause, and consequence are not inherently beyond the reach of primary-aged children, provided they are introduced appropriately.

2. **Children's historical understanding develops through active enquiry** rather than passive reception of information. The process of asking historical questions, examining evidence, and constructing interpretations is accessible to young learners when scaffolded effectively.

3. **Prior knowledge and experience profoundly influence** how children make sense of the past. Cooper's research highlighted the importance of building bridges between children's lived experiences and historical content.

4. **Historical thinking involves distinct cognitive processes** that can be identified, taught, and assessed. These include understanding chronology, recognising similarity and difference, identifying cause and consequence, interpreting evidence, and understanding historical significance.

5. **Young children are capable of constructing historical interpretations** and understanding that the past can be interpreted in different ways. This insight challenged the notion that multiple perspectives and interpretations should be reserved for older students.

## Major Publications and Their Impact

Cooper's written work has had a profound influence on history education policy, curriculum design, and classroom practice, both in the United Kingdom and internationally.

### *History in the Early Years* (2002)

This seminal text, published by Routledge in its second edition in 2002, remains a cornerstone of early years history education. The book addresses a significant gap in the literature by focusing specifically on history teaching for children in the early years and Key Stage 1 (ages 3–7).

**Structure and Content:**

The book is organised into four parts:

1. **Theoretical Foundations**—examining how young children understand concepts of time, change, and the past
2. **History During the First Three Years of School**—practical guidance on teaching chronology, interpretations, and evidence work
3. **Organisation, Planning, and Assessment**—long-term planning and unit design
4. **Case Studies**—detailed examples including 'Toys and Games, Now and Then' and 'Castles'

Cooper argues that history should be a 'significant dimension of early years education' and provides extensive practical guidance on how practitioners can develop young children's sense of identity through historical learning. The book is notable for its integration of theoretical rigour with classroom practicality.

**Pedagogical Insights:**

The text introduced several influential pedagogical approaches:
- **Using artefacts to develop historical thinking**—Cooper demonstrated how physical objects could serve as entry points for young children to engage with historical enquiry
- **Story as a vehicle for historical understanding**—the importance of narrative in making the past accessible
- **The role of play in historical learning**—how imaginative play can support children's engagement with historical contexts
- **Developing chronological understanding** through concrete, experiential activities

The book received significant critical acclaim, with reviewers praising its 'biblical authority on the subject' and its success in providing both 'theoretical underpinning of good practice' and 'sufficient practical help to translate principles into memorable experiences.'

### *Teaching History Creatively* (first edition 2012, second edition 2017)

Edited by Cooper and published by Routledge, this edited collection brought together contributions from leading history educators to explore creative approaches to primary history teaching. Now in its second edition, the book has become essential reading for primary teachers seeking to move beyond didactic approaches.

**Central Arguments:**

The book is built on Cooper's conviction that teaching and learning in history must be creative. This creativity manifests in multiple ways:
- **Creative use of sources**—moving beyond traditional text-based sources to incorporate artefacts, images, oral histories, and material culture
- **Creative approaches to chronology**—innovative ways of helping children understand concepts of time and change
- **Creative interpretation**—enabling children to construct their own historical narratives and interpretations
- **Creative connections**—linking history with other curriculum areas, particularly the arts

Cooper's own contributions to the volume articulate a clear vision of creative history pedagogy. She argues that creativity in history is not merely about making lessons 'fun' but about enabling genuine historical enquiry that respects children's intellectual capacities.

### *History 5–11: A Guide for Teachers* (multiple editions, 4th edition 2025)

This comprehensive guide, regularly updated to reflect curriculum changes, provides a thorough introduction to teaching history across the primary phase. The fourth edition, due in 2025, demonstrates the continuing relevance of Cooper's work.

**Coverage:**

The book addresses:
- The rationale for history in the primary curriculum
- The National Curriculum requirements and how to interpret them
- Approaches to teaching historical concepts and skills
- Planning and assessment in primary history
- Inclusive practice and differentiation
- Using sources and evidence
- Developing chronological understanding
- Historical interpretations and perspectives

### *Writing History 7–11: Historical Writing in Different Genres* (2014)

This edited collection, also published by Routledge, focuses specifically on developing children's historical writing. Cooper's contributions examine:
- **Historians' themes and genres**—introducing children to the forms of writing historians use
- **Talk, reading, and writing in breadth and depth studies**—the integration of oracy and literacy with historical content
- **Writing about time**—developing children's capacity to express temporal relationships
- **Writing historical fiction based on evidence**—a creative approach that demands rigorous historical thinking

This work has been influential in highlighting the importance of historical literacy and the potential of writing as a tool for developing historical understanding.

## The History Education International Research Network (HEIRNET)

In 2004, Cooper, together with Dr Jon Nichol of Exeter University's History Education Centre, founded the History Education International Research Network (HEIRNET). This organisation has become a significant force in international history education research.

### Origins and Purpose

HEIRNET emerged from a conference for history educators organised by Cooper and Nichol at Ambleside, Cumbria. The network's purpose is 'to share and discuss international research into the aims, purposes and scope of history education for 3–25 year olds.'

Since its foundation, HEIRNET has:
- Organised annual international conferences around the world
- Facilitated collaboration between researchers, teacher educators, and practitioners across national boundaries
- Provided a forum for sharing research on curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment in history education
- Supported the development of early career researchers in the field

### The History Education Research Journal

Cooper and Nichol created and edited the journal, which was initially published by the University of Cumbria, then by the Historical Association, and since 2019 has been published by University College London (UCL) under its current title. The journal provides a vital platform for research in history education and has helped to establish the field as a rigorous academic discipline.

Cooper has served as a journal editor from 2000 to the present, demonstrating her long-standing commitment to developing the research base of history education.

### International Conferences and Collaboration

Through HEIRNET, Cooper has been instrumental in building international research networks. Recent conferences and presentations include:

- **2020:** Technical University, Amsterdam
- **2019:** University of Vienna—'Constructivist Approaches to Chronology Using the Horrible History Series of Terry Deary'
- **2018:** Ionian University, Corfu—research on how 11-year-old children interpret paintings to consider similarity, difference, and change
- **2017:** Dublin City University—'The big picture: how can primary school children identify patterns and make connections in history?'
- **2016:** University of Mercia, Spain—'Creativity and Writing Historical Fiction based on Evidence'
- **2015:** Institute of Education, London University—comparative research with Japanese colleagues on children's deductions from prehistoric sources

This international work has positioned Cooper as a leading figure in global history education research.

## Pedagogical Philosophy: Constructivism in History Education

At the heart of Cooper's work lies a consistent commitment to constructivist pedagogy.

### Principles of Constructivism

1. **Children are active meaning-makers**—not passive recipients of historical information. Historical knowledge is constructed by learners through engagement with sources, questions, and problems.

2. **Prior knowledge and experience matter**—children bring existing understandings to their study of history, and effective teaching builds on these foundations whilst addressing misconceptions.

3. **Learning is a social process**—historical understanding develops through dialogue, collaboration, and the sharing of perspectives.

4. **Scaffolding is essential**—whilst children are capable of sophisticated historical thinking, they require appropriate support and structure to reach their potential.

5. **Authentic enquiry is central**—children learn history best when engaged in genuine historical questions and investigations.

### Implications for Classroom Practice

**Using Artefacts:**

Cooper has been a consistent advocate for using physical artefacts as entry points for historical enquiry. Her 2020 publication, 'Using Artefacts to teach Historical Thinking Skills to Young Children', articulates how objects can:
- Provide concrete, tangible connections to the past
- Stimulate curiosity and generate historical questions
- Support the development of inference and deduction skills
- Enable young children to engage with the work of historians

**Enquiry-Based Learning:**

History teaching should be organised around enquiries—structured investigations that enable children to work as historians.

**Creativity and Historical Imagination:**

Cooper's concept of creativity in history goes beyond arts-based activities. Creative history teaching involves:
- Imaginative engagement with past perspectives
- Constructing narratives and interpretations
- Making connections between past and present
- Developing empathy with people in different historical contexts

## Contributions to Curriculum and Assessment

### National Curriculum Engagement

Throughout her career, Cooper has engaged actively with the development and implementation of the National Curriculum for history in England.

### Planning and Assessment Frameworks

Cooper's publications offer detailed guidance on:
- **Long-term planning**—how to construct a coherent history curriculum across the primary years
- **Medium-term planning**—designing units of study that develop historical understanding
- **Assessment for learning**—strategies for supporting children's developing historical thinking
- **Differentiation**—meeting the needs of diverse learners in history
