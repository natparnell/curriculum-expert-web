## Academic and Professional Journals

### Teaching History

**Teaching History**, published quarterly by the Historical Association, is the UK's leading professional journal for history teachers at secondary level. Established in 1976, it has a distribution exceeding 3,000 and maintains a growing international readership. The journal occupies a unique position in the landscape of history education publications, bridging the gap between academic research and classroom practice.

Each issue of Teaching History focuses on a specific theme relevant to history teaching. Recent themes have included "Curriculum Journeys" (Issue 198), "Public History" (Issue 197), "Demanding History" (Issue 196), "Perspectives in Time" (Issue 195), "Climate and Environment" (Issue 194), and "Mediating History" (Issue 193). These themed issues allow for deep exploration of particular aspects of history education, bringing together multiple perspectives and approaches.

The journal is renowned for its practical focus. Articles typically combine theoretical insight with classroom-ready strategies, making research accessible to busy practitioners. Regular features include "Cunning Plan," which offers detailed lesson sequences; "Mummy, Mummy!", exploring how to make challenging topics accessible; and "Using Scholarship," demonstrating how academic historical research can inform school history.

Teaching History has been instrumental in developing key concepts in history education. Articles published in the journal have introduced and refined ideas such as enquiry-based learning, the use of historical scholarship in the classroom, and strategies for developing pupils' historical thinking. The journal's archive, stretching back nearly five decades, represents an invaluable resource for understanding the development of history education in the UK.

### Primary History

**Primary History** is the Historical Association's termly journal dedicated to history teaching at primary level. As the only dedicated journal for primary history teachers in the UK, it fills a crucial niche in the professional literature. Primary History recognises the particular challenges and opportunities of teaching history to younger pupils, including the need to develop foundational historical concepts, engage pupils with diverse pasts, and integrate history within a crowded primary curriculum.

Articles in Primary History address topics such as developing chronological understanding in Key Stage 1, using stories and artefacts to engage young learners, planning coherent curriculum sequences across the primary years, and assessing historical learning in age-appropriate ways. The journal frequently includes practical resources, lesson ideas, and case studies from primary classrooms.

The journal has played a significant role in supporting primary teachers, many of whom lack specialist history training, to develop confidence and expertise in teaching the subject. It serves as a bridge between the academic discipline of history and the practical realities of the primary classroom, helping teachers to make history meaningful and engaging for young learners.

### History Education Research Journal (HERJ)

The **History Education Research Journal** (HERJ) is a peer-reviewed academic journal that publishes research on history education from international perspectives. Supported by the Historical Association and published by UCL Press, HERJ was previously published under the title International Journal of Historical Learning, Teaching and Research. The journal represents the more academic end of the publication spectrum, targeting researchers, doctoral students, and teachers interested in engaging with scholarly research.

HERJ publishes articles addressing contemporary issues, concerns, policies, and practice in history education. It particularly welcomes papers that attend to the implications for policy and practice arising from theoretical and empirical work. Themes of interest include curriculum development, teaching and teacher education, academic progression, didactics, historical consciousness, the intersection between education and public history, community history, national and international perspectives, historical literacy, disciplinary history, and the history of history education.

The journal's international scope allows UK educators to engage with developments in history education across the world. Articles have explored history education in diverse contexts, from European nations to the Americas, Asia, and Africa. This international perspective enriches the field, offering insights into different approaches to common challenges and highlighting the cultural specificity of history education.

### History (The Historian)

**History**, the journal of the Historical Association, has been published since 1912. While not exclusively focused on education, it serves an important role in keeping teachers connected to developments in academic history. The journal publishes articles by leading historians, reviews of new historical scholarship, and features exploring how academic research can inform school history.

**The Historian**, a separate HA publication, offers illustrated articles on historical topics, often written to be accessible to non-specialists. For history teachers, particularly those teaching outside their specialism, The Historian provides valuable subject knowledge updates and insights into current historical debates.

## Official and Government Publications

### Ofsted Research Review Series: History

Ofsted's **Research Review Series: History**, published in July 2021, represents the most comprehensive recent statement on evidence-informed history education in England. The review synthesises research on factors affecting the quality of history education, including curriculum, pedagogy, assessment, and school leadership.

The review is structured around a "quality of education" model, examining how different elements contribute to effective history teaching. It considers curriculum progression, emphasising the importance of developing pupils' historical knowledge and understanding systematically over time. The review discusses the relationship between substantive knowledge (knowledge of the past) and disciplinary knowledge (knowledge of how history works as a discipline).

Key themes in the review include:

- **Curriculum coherence**: The importance of planning curricula that build knowledge progressively, making connections within and across topics
- **Historical knowledge**: The distinction between substantive and disciplinary knowledge, and the importance of both
- **Pedagogy**: Evidence on effective teaching approaches, including the use of enquiry questions, historical sources, and academic scholarship
- **Assessment**: How assessment can support learning in history, including the use of formative assessment and the assessment of historical thinking
- **Leadership**: The role of subject leaders in developing and sustaining high-quality history provision

The review has been influential in shaping discussions about history education, though it has also been subject to critique. Some historians and educators have questioned particular interpretations of the evidence or the implications drawn from it. Nevertheless, it remains essential reading for history teachers and leaders seeking to understand the current policy context.

### Ofsted Subject Report Series: History

Following the research review, Ofsted published a **Subject Report Series: History** in July 2023. This report evaluated the common strengths and weaknesses of history teaching in primary and secondary schools inspected under the Education Inspection Framework (EIF).

The report drew on evidence from inspections conducted since 2019, providing a snapshot of history education across England. It identified areas of strength, including teachers' subject knowledge and passion for history, as well as areas for development, such as curriculum coherence and the integration of disciplinary concepts.

For history teachers and leaders, the subject report provides valuable insights into how inspection is interpreting the research review and what this means for practice in schools.

## Research Monographs and Academic Books

### Historical Thinking and Other Unnatural Acts (Sam Wineburg)

Sam Wineburg's **Historical Thinking and Other Unnatural Acts** (2001) is one of the most influential books on history education internationally. While written from a US perspective, its insights have profoundly influenced UK practice. Wineburg's research into how historians read and think has shaped understandings of historical literacy and the nature of historical thinking.

Wineburg argues that historical thinking is "unnatural" in the sense that it requires cognitive strategies different from those used in everyday life. His research demonstrates how expert historians approach sources differently from novices, and he explores the implications for teaching. The book has been particularly influential in discussions of how to teach pupils to work with historical evidence and how to develop their disciplinary understanding.

### Knowing, Teaching and Learning History (Peter Seixas et al.)

**Knowing, Teaching and Learning History: National and International Perspectives**, edited by Peter Seixas, Peter Stearns, and Sam Wineburg (2000), brought together scholars from multiple countries to explore how history is taught and learned. The book provides international perspectives on common challenges, including the teaching of historical thinking, the relationship between history and national identity, and the uses of history in public life.

The book has been influential in broadening perspectives beyond national contexts, encouraging UK educators to engage with developments in Canada, the United States, Europe, and elsewhere.

### Understanding History Teaching (Chris Husbands et al.)

**Understanding History Teaching**, edited by Chris Husbands, Alison Kitson, and Anna Pendry (2003), reported findings from a research study exploring history teaching in secondary schools. The book offered insights into teachers' beliefs and practices, the factors shaping curriculum decisions, and the relationship between research and practice.

The research revealed the complexity of teachers' decision-making and the multiple influences on practice. It highlighted the importance of teachers' subject knowledge, their beliefs about the purposes of history education, and the practical constraints they faced. The book remains valuable for understanding the realities of history teaching in schools.

## Using Publications for Professional Development

### Developing a Reading Practice

Engaging with publications is a key element of continuing professional development for history teachers. Effective CPD through reading involves:

**Selective Focus**: Rather than attempting to read everything, teachers should identify publications most relevant to their current needs and interests. A teacher developing curriculum for Key Stage 3 might prioritise Teaching History and curriculum development guides, while a teacher preparing for inspection might focus on Ofsted publications.

**Critical Engagement**: Teachers should read critically, considering the evidence and arguments presented and relating them to their own context. Not all published advice will be appropriate for all settings, and teachers need to make professional judgments about what to adopt.

**Collaborative Reading**: Reading with colleagues, whether in formal CPD sessions or informal discussions, can deepen understanding and support implementation. Departmental reading groups can focus on particular articles or books, discussing implications for practice.

**Connecting to Practice**: Reading is most valuable when connected to classroom practice. Teachers might trial approaches suggested in publications, reflect on their effectiveness, and contribute their own insights to the professional community.

### Building a Department Library

History departments should maintain a library of key publications for staff use. Essential holdings might include:

- Complete sets of Teaching History (available to HA members digitally)
- Key texts such as Debates in History Teaching and MasterClass in History Education
- Ofsted research review and subject report
- Historical Association pamphlets and guides
- Textbooks used by pupils

Making publications easily accessible encourages staff to engage with research and develop their practice.

### Contributing to Publications

Teachers should consider contributing to publications themselves. Teaching History and Primary History welcome submissions from practising teachers sharing their innovative practice. Writing for publication develops teachers' reflective capacity and contributes to the collective
