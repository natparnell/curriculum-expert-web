# The Historical Association

## Overview and Purpose

The Historical Association (HA) is the United Kingdom's leading independent charity dedicated to supporting the teaching, learning, and enjoyment of history at all levels. Founded in 1906, the organisation has been the authoritative voice for history education in British schools for over a century, representing the interests of history teachers to government departments, examination boards, and other educational authorities.

The HA's fundamental mission is to provide the best possible resources and support for history teachers throughout the United Kingdom, whilst encouraging the teaching and learning of history across all educational phases. The association serves as the essential bridge between academic historical research and classroom practice, ensuring that teachers have access to current scholarship, pedagogical innovations, and subject-specific professional development.

As a membership charity incorporated by Royal Charter, the Historical Association operates independently of government control whilst maintaining constructive relationships with policymakers. This independence allows the HA to advocate freely for high-quality history education based on evidence and professional expertise rather than political considerations.

## Founding and Historical Development

### Establishment in 1906

The Historical Association was founded on 5 January 1906, when a small group of history teachers and academic historians met in London to discuss the growing need for good history resources in schools. The organisation emerged at a time when history teaching was becoming increasingly formalised within the British education system, yet teachers lacked access to quality materials, professional networks, and representation in educational policy discussions.

From its inception, the HA was designed to be complementary to the Royal Historical Society (RHS), which focused primarily on academic historical research. The Historical Association, by contrast, concentrated specifically on the practical application of historical knowledge in educational settings, bridging the gap between university-based historians and schoolteachers.

### Original Aims and Objectives

The association's first stated aims established its enduring purpose:

- To support history teachers across all educational phases
- To encourage the teaching and learning of history in schools
- To research and distribute ideas on the teaching of history
- To represent the needs and interests of teachers to government departments and other authorities with control over education

These objectives remain remarkably consistent with the HA's contemporary work, demonstrating the continuity of the organisation's mission across more than a century of educational change.

### Expansion and Growth

Throughout the twentieth century, the Historical Association expanded its reach and influence significantly. The organisation developed an extensive network of local branches, created influential publications, and established itself as the authoritative voice for history teaching in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.

The HA adapted to major educational changes, including the introduction of the National Curriculum in 1988, successive curriculum reforms, and the evolution of examination systems. Throughout these transitions, the association maintained its commitment to evidence-based advocacy for rigorous, engaging history education that develops pupils' historical thinking as well as their knowledge of the past.

## Organisational Structure and Governance

### Membership Base

The Historical Association currently has over 8,000 individual, corporate, and associate members representing a diverse community of history educators. The membership includes:

- Primary school teachers and subject leaders
- Secondary school history teachers, from trainees to heads of department
- Academic historians working in higher education
- Heritage educators in museums, archives, and historic sites
- Local historians and history enthusiasts
- Teacher educators and education researchers

This broad membership base ensures that the HA represents the full spectrum of history education contexts and maintains strong connections between different educational phases.

### Branch Network

A distinctive feature of the Historical Association is its extensive network of over 40 active branches throughout the United Kingdom. These branches operate as semi-autonomous local organisations run by volunteer committees, providing regional support and community for history teachers.

Branches run a wide variety of events including:
- Historical talks by leading academics and researchers
- CPD workshops focused on specific pedagogical approaches
- Historical walks and site visits
- Social events and networking opportunities
- Local history projects and publications
- Collaboration with local heritage organisations

The branch structure enables the HA to deliver localised support that responds to regional contexts whilst maintaining national standards and priorities. Branch associate membership extends the overall HA community significantly beyond the core membership figure.

### Governance and Professional Staff

The Historical Association operates with a combination of professional staff and volunteer governance. The national organisation is based at 59a Kennington Park Road, London, with a team of professional staff coordinating publications, CPD programmes, membership services, and policy work.

The association is governed by an elected council representing different membership categories and regions, with honorary officers including a president and vice-presidents drawn from distinguished historians and educators.

## Publications and Resources

### Teaching History (Secondary)

*Teaching History* is the Historical Association's flagship journal for secondary school history teachers. Established in 1976, the journal has been at the forefront of developing and disseminating innovative approaches to history pedagogy for nearly five decades.

The journal's original goal was to provide history teachers at all levels with the best and newest teaching ideas for their classrooms. Over the years, *Teaching History* has become essential reading for history educators, featuring:

- Articles on curriculum development and planning
- Classroom strategies and teaching approaches
- Analysis of pupils' historical thinking and misconceptions
- Research-informed practice from teacher-researchers
- Examinations of disciplinary concepts in classroom contexts
- Resources for teaching specific historical topics

The journal has been instrumental in developing key pedagogical frameworks now widely used in history teaching, including work on historical significance, causation, evidence, and interpretations. Articles from *Teaching History* are frequently cited in academic research on history education and have influenced curriculum policy and examination specifications.

### Primary History

*Primary History* is the HA's dedicated magazine for primary teachers, providing resources and support for history education in the early years and primary phases. The publication recognises the particular challenges and opportunities of teaching history to young children, offering:

- Schemes of work and lesson sequences
- Guidance on adapting historical content for younger learners
- Assessment approaches appropriate for primary history
- Cross-curricular links and topic planning
- Resources for specific historical periods and topics

Recent themed issues have covered topics such as "Women with Power," "The Ancient Greeks," and "Climate and Environment," demonstrating the magazine's commitment to connecting historical learning with contemporary issues and diverse perspectives.

### The Historian

*The Historian* is the HA's magazine for a wider readership, including general history enthusiasts, local historians, and those with an interest in historical study beyond formal education. This publication helps maintain connections between the educational and broader historical communities.

### History and HERJ

The Historical Association also publishes *History*, an academic journal in partnership with Wiley, and supports the *History Education Research Journal (HERJ)*, which provides an international medium for reporting on research and developments in history education from early years to higher education.

## Professional Development Programmes

### Continuing Professional Development (CPD)

The Historical Association offers a comprehensive range of CPD opportunities for history teachers at all career stages. The HA's approach to professional development is grounded in research evidence about effective teacher learning, emphasising sustained engagement over time rather than one-off events.

CPD provision includes:

- **National and regional conferences** bringing together hundreds of history teachers for keynote presentations, workshops, and networking
- **Online webinars** accessible to members across the country, covering topical issues and practical classroom strategies
- **Bespoke training** for individual schools, multi-academy trusts, and federations
- **Subject leader development** specifically designed for those coordinating history provision

The HA's CPD is distinctive in its consistent focus on subject-specific development. Rather than generic teaching strategies, HA courses address the particular challenges and opportunities of history teaching, including:

- Developing pupils' historical thinking and disciplinary understanding
- Planning coherent curriculum sequences
- Teaching sensitive and controversial topics
- Using historical scholarship to inform curriculum decisions
- Assessment that supports learning in history

### Teacher Fellowships

The Historical Association's Teacher Fellowship programmes provide immersive professional development experiences for selected teachers. These competitive programmes offer extended opportunities to engage with historical scholarship, develop curriculum resources, and contribute to the HA's publication programme.

Fellowship programmes typically involve:
- Engagement with academic historians and their research
- Creation of teaching resources based on current scholarship
- Publication of outcomes for the wider teaching community
- Development of expertise in specific historical periods or themes

Past fellowship programmes have covered topics ranging from the later Middle Ages to the Korean War and its legacy, with resources produced by fellows made freely available to the teaching community.

### Chartered Teacher of History (CTHist)

The Chartered Teacher of History programme, launched in recent years, provides a prestigious accreditation for experienced history educators. This scheme follows successful Chartered Teacher programmes already established in English, Geography, Mathematics, and Science.

The Chartered Teacher designation recognises a high level of expertise in both:
- Historical knowledge and understanding
- Age-appropriate pedagogy

To achieve Chartered Teacher status, candidates must demonstrate:
- Ongoing involvement in the teaching of history and/or education of those teaching history
- Deep subject knowledge across a range of historical periods
- Sophisticated understanding of history pedagogy
- Commitment to continued professional development
- Contribution to the history teaching community

The programme is open to history educators in a variety of settings including primary and secondary schools, special schools, FE colleges, and heritage education. Registration requires HA membership and payment of a programme fee, with the designation valid for three years and renewable through demonstration of continued engagement with professional development.

Chartered Teacher status provides external recognition of expertise that can support career progression and professional credibility. The application process requires candidates to present evidence across multiple domains of practice, with exemplar applications available to support prospective applicants.

## Quality Mark for History

### Purpose and Framework

The Historical Association's Quality Mark (QM) is an award that recognises excellence of history provision in primary and secondary schools. The scheme provides a framework for schools to evaluate, celebrate, and where necessary improve their history provision.

The Quality Mark is designed to:
- Recognise and celebrate excellent history provision
- Provide a structured framework for self-evaluation and development
- Support schools in preparing for Ofsted inspections
- Promote consistently high standards across the subject

The framework examines history provision across multiple dimensions including curriculum, teaching quality, leadership, enrichment, and pupil outcomes.

### Levels of Recognition

Schools can achieve the Quality Mark at three levels:

- **Bronze**: Good history provision meeting baseline standards
- **Silver**: Strong history provision with identifiable strengths
- **Gold**: Exceptional history provision demonstrating sustained excellence

Each level requires schools to demonstrate achievement against a set of criteria covering curriculum design, teaching and learning, leadership and management, enrichment, and assessment.

### The Assessment Process

To achieve the Quality Mark, schools undertake a structured self-evaluation process supported by the HA. The process involves:

1. **Initial self-assessment** against the Quality Mark criteria
2. **Evidence gathering** to demonstrate meeting the standards
3. **Submission of a portfolio** documenting history provision
4. **External assessment** by a trained HA assessor, typically including a school visit
5. **Feedback and recommendations** for continued development

Schools that achieve the Quality Mark retain it for three years, after which they must reapply. Gold Quality Mark schools must complete the full process again after three years to maintain their status.

### Benefits for Schools

The Quality Mark provides multiple benefits for participating schools:

- **External validation** of history provision by subject specialists
- **Preparation for Ofsted inspection** under frameworks requiring developed curriculum thinking
- **Framework for development** supporting improvement planning
- **Recognition and celebration** of history teachers' expertise and commitment
- **Networking opportunities** with other Quality Mark schools

Schools inspected under the 2019 Ofsted inspection framework find the Quality Mark particularly valuable, as the framework requirements align closely with Ofsted's focus on curriculum quality, sequencing, and implementation.

### Links to Chartered Teacher

The Quality Mark and Chartered Teacher programmes are designed to complement each other. Whilst the Quality Mark recognises whole-school history provision, the Chartered Teacher scheme provides individual recognition for teachers wishing to gain acknowledgement of their personal expertise. Schools working towards Quality Mark may find that supporting teachers to achieve Chartered Teacher status strengthens their provision and provides additional evidence for their Quality Mark application.

## Impact and Significance

### Influence on History Education

The Historical Association has had a profound influence on the development of history education in the United Kingdom. Through its publications, CPD programmes, and advocacy, the HA has:

- Established frameworks for thinking about history pedagogy that are now widely adopted
- Supported generations of history teachers in developing their expertise
