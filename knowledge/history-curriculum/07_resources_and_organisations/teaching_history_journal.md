# Teaching History Journal: Key Themes

## Overview and Purpose

**Teaching History** is the UK's leading professional journal for secondary history teachers, published quarterly by the **Historical Association (HA)**. With a distribution exceeding 3,000 copies and a growing international readership, the journal has served as the primary vehicle for practice-based professional thinking in history education since its inception. The journal reaches classroom teachers, heads of department, trainee teachers, and academic libraries, making it a cornerstone of continuing professional development for history educators across the United Kingdom and beyond.

The journal's fundamental purpose is to bridge the gap between academic history and classroom practice. It translates disciplinary knowledge into pedagogical approaches that teachers can implement with their pupils, whilst simultaneously capturing the collective wisdom of the history teaching profession. In this respect, Teaching History embodies what the HA describes as "practice-based professional thinking"—knowledge generated through reflection on classroom experience rather than purely theoretical or research-driven approaches.

## History and Evolution

### Origins and Early Development

Teaching History emerged from the recognition that history teachers needed a dedicated space to share approaches, resources, and reflections on their practice. Unlike general education journals, it focused specifically on the disciplinary demands of teaching history, addressing both the substantive content of the past and the procedural concepts through which that content is understood.

The journal's early editions reflected the pedagogical concerns of their time, including debates about the balance between chronological and thematic approaches, the role of examinations in shaping curriculum choices, and the challenge of making history relevant to increasingly diverse cohorts of pupils.

### The 1990s: A Period of Professional Assertion

The 1990s marked a significant period of development for Teaching History and the profession it served. As noted in Teaching History 171, many history teachers became "analytic, active and vocal" during this decade, claiming that neglect of substantive knowledge hindered pupils' progress in critical historical thinking. This period saw the emergence of what would become a defining characteristic of the journal: the insistence that substantive knowledge (the 'stuff' of history) and disciplinary knowledge (the procedures and concepts through which historians work) must not only be equally strong but must actively complement and serve one another.

The journal became a platform for teachers engaged in research, those active in subject associations, and participants in thriving local history education communities. These practitioners led what the HA describes as "the fascinating endeavour of ensuring that substantive and disciplinary dimensions of the subject (earlier known as 'knowledge and skills') are not only equally strong, but that they complement and serve one another."

### The 200th Edition Milestone

In 2024, Teaching History celebrated its 200th edition, a remarkable achievement that demonstrated both the journal's longevity and its continuing relevance. The 200th edition, titled "Telling Histories," was made open-access to non-members for a limited period, reflecting the HA's commitment to supporting the wider history teaching community.

This edition exemplified the journal's breadth, including articles on:
- Historical oracy and its assessment
- Using stories about the French Revolution with sixth-form students
- Teaching environmental history in the medieval period
- Approaches to national identities and belonging across the curriculum
- Promoting self-efficacy through combined literacy and oracy projects
- Historiographical debates about global history
- The impact of changing technology on history classrooms

## Regular Features

Teaching History is structured around several regular features that have become integral to its identity and utility for practitioners.

### What's the Wisdom On?

**"What's the Wisdom On..."** provides short guides offering new history teachers an overview of the 'story so far' of practice-based professional thinking about particular aspects of history teaching. These guides synthesise key messages from Teaching History articles, blogs, and other publications, providing practical suggestions suitable for any key stage whilst signposting essential reading for new professionals.

A notable example is the guide on **enquiry questions**, which explicitly distinguishes the journal's approach from discovery learning. The HA made clear that enquiry questions in history were developed "in direct opposition to the principles of 'discovery learning' and to the assumption that pupils would become effective independent thinkers simply by being given more independence." Instead, well-crafted enquiries "explicitly facilitate a knowledge-rich approach to history and allow the teacher to guide the pupil through complex and contrary histories rather than leaving them to reach ill-informed judgements without adequate knowledge."

### New, Novice or Nervous?

**"New, Novice or Nervous?"** is designed specifically to help teachers new to history locate key articles written about essential aspects of teaching and learning. Recognising that the accumulated wisdom of 200 editions can be overwhelming for newcomers, this feature curates essential reading and provides entry points into the journal's extensive archive.

The feature acknowledges the particular challenges faced by non-specialist teachers, early career teachers, and those transferring from other subjects. It addresses foundational questions about what makes history distinctive as a school subject and how to approach its teaching with confidence.

### Move Me On

**"Move Me On"** functions as a problem page for history mentors, offering practical help to anyone involved in training new history teachers. This feature addresses the specific challenges that arise during initial teacher education, from planning first enquiries to managing behaviour in history-specific contexts.

Each "Move Me On" entry typically presents a scenario or dilemma faced by a trainee or mentor, followed by practical advice grounded in classroom experience. The feature recognises that mentoring is itself a skilled practice and supports mentors in developing their own capacity to support beginning teachers.

### Polychronicon

**"Polychronicon"** is designed to help history teachers update their subject knowledge. In a subject where new scholarship constantly reshapes understanding of the past, this feature ensures that teachers remain connected to developments in academic history that might inform their curriculum choices or deepen their teaching of particular topics.

The feature typically presents accessible summaries of recent historiographical debates or new research findings, written specifically for classroom practitioners rather than academic specialists.

### Cunning Plan

**"Cunning Plan"** provides step-by-step plans for tackling particular teaching issues. These are detailed, practical resources that teachers can adapt for their own contexts. Each Cunning Plan addresses a specific pedagogical challenge—whether teaching a difficult concept, approaching an unfamiliar topic, or developing particular disciplinary thinking—and offers a worked example of how an experienced teacher has addressed it.

For instance, Teaching History 200 included a Cunning Plan for "teaching about environmental history in the medieval period," demonstrating how even topics that might seem marginal to traditional curricula can be approached systematically.

### Triumphs Show

**"Triumphs Show"** serves as a showcase for sharing teachers' successes and inspirational ideas. This feature celebrates innovation and creativity in history classrooms, offering readers concrete examples of effective practice that they might adapt or emulate.

### What Have Historians Been Arguing About?

This feature surveys significant historiographical debates, making them accessible for teachers who wish to bring a sense of historical interpretation and contestation into their classrooms. For example, editions have examined arguments about global history, demonstrating how academic debates can inform school-level discussions about historical significance and perspective.

## Key Pedagogical Themes

### The Knowledge-Rich Approach

A recurring theme throughout Teaching History's evolution has been the development of what might be termed a "knowledge-rich" approach to history education. This approach insists that historical thinking cannot be developed in the abstract but must be grounded in detailed knowledge of the past. As the HA has articulated, substantive knowledge must be taught in ways that serve disciplinary thinking, not as an end in itself.

This theme emerged particularly strongly from the 1990s onwards, as the journal's contributors argued against approaches that separated "skills" from "content." The preferred framing—substantive knowledge and disciplinary knowledge—captures the interdependence of knowing things about the past and knowing how historical knowledge is constructed.

### Enquiry-Based Learning

The journal has been instrumental in developing and refining approaches to **enquiry-based learning** in history. As the "What's the Wisdom On" guide makes clear, the journal's conception of enquiry differs significantly from discovery learning or generic "independent learning" approaches.

In the Teaching History tradition, enquiry questions serve several functions:
- They provide coherence and direction to sequences of lessons
- They create intellectual challenge by requiring pupils to engage with genuine historical questions
- They structure the relationship between substantive knowledge and disciplinary thinking
- They enable teachers to guide pupils through complex material whilst maintaining intellectual rigour

The journal has explored how to craft effective enquiry questions, how to structure enquiry sequences, and how to assess the learning that results from enquiry-based approaches.

### Disciplinary Concepts

Teaching History has given extensive attention to what are variously termed **disciplinary concepts**, **second-order concepts**, or **procedural concepts**—the conceptual tools through which historians organise and make sense of the past. These include:

- **Change and continuity**: understanding how to identify and explain change over time whilst recognising what persisted
- **Cause and consequence**: analysing the factors that produced historical outcomes and their subsequent effects
- **Similarity and difference**: comparing across time and place whilst understanding historical specificity
- **Significance**: making and justifying judgments about which aspects of the past merit attention
- **Evidence and interpretation**: understanding how historical knowledge is constructed from sources and why historians disagree

The journal has explored how to teach these concepts explicitly, how they develop across key stages, and how they can be assessed.

### Substantive Knowledge

Alongside disciplinary thinking, Teaching History has consistently emphasised the importance of **substantive knowledge**—the actual content of the past that pupils learn. The journal has addressed questions of curriculum content selection, the organisation of knowledge across key stages, and strategies for ensuring that pupils retain and can use historical knowledge.

Contributors have explored how to teach substantive concepts (such as 'feudalism', 'revolution', or 'empire') that pupils need to understand the past but which are themselves contested and complex. They have also addressed the challenge of teaching chronological frameworks that enable pupils to orient themselves in time.

### Assessment and Progression

The journal has given sustained attention to questions of **assessment** and **progression** in history. This includes:
- Developing assessment tasks that capture genuine historical thinking rather than generic skills
- Creating progression models that show how pupils' historical understanding develops over time
- Designing feedback strategies that help pupils improve their historical work
- Managing the relationship between formative assessment and summative requirements

Teaching History has been particularly concerned with ensuring that assessment serves learning rather than distorting it, and that teachers can recognise and support progression in pupils' historical thinking.

### Oracy and Literacy in History

Recent editions have given significant attention to the development of **historical oracy** and **disciplinary literacy**. Articles have explored how to support pupils in articulating historical arguments orally, how to combine literacy and oracy projects to promote self-efficacy, and how to recognise and assess historical talk.

This reflects a broader recognition that historical thinking must be expressed and developed through language, and that supporting pupils' use of historical language is integral to developing their historical understanding.

### Inclusive Curriculum and Identity

Teaching History has increasingly addressed questions of **inclusive curriculum design** and the relationship between history education and **identity**. Articles have examined approaches to teaching about national identities and belonging, strategies for making history relevant to diverse cohorts of pupils, and ways of handling controversial or sensitive topics.

The journal has explored how history education can both acknowledge multiple perspectives and maintain commitment to historical rigour, avoiding both a simplistic pluralism and a false objectivity.

## Impact on Policy and Practice

### Influencing Curriculum Development

Teaching History has played a significant role in shaping national curriculum development in England. The journal's contributors have been involved in curriculum reviews, have advised examination boards, and have shaped the Ofsted framework for inspecting history.

The HA's intervention when the Department for Education appeared to conflate enquiry questions with discovery learning exemplifies the journal's role in maintaining clarity about effective history pedagogy at the policy level.

### Supporting Teacher Development

For individual teachers, Teaching History serves as a continuing professional development resource. The combination of theoretical grounding and practical application enables teachers to develop their thinking whilst accessing immediately usable resources and approaches.

The journal's regular features provide structured pathways into its content, supporting teachers at different career stages—from those who are "new, novice or nervous" through to experienced practitioners seeking to develop particular aspects of their practice.

### Building Professional Community

Perhaps most importantly, Teaching History has contributed to building a **professional community** amongst history teachers. By providing a shared reference point and a common language for discussing practice, the journal has enabled teachers to see themselves as part of a collective enterprise with shared values and aspirations.

This community extends beyond the journal itself into the HA's wider activities, including local networks, national conferences, and online forums. Teaching History both documents and contributes to this community's collective wisdom.

## Using Teaching History Effectively

### For Beginning Teachers

New history teachers are advised to begin with the "New, Novice or Nervous?" and "What's the Wisdom On?" features, which provide accessible entry points into the journal's accumulated wisdom. The former helps locate essential articles on foundational aspects of history teaching; the latter synthesises professional thinking about specific topics.

Beginning teachers might also find "Cunning Plan" and "Move Me On" particularly useful, as these offer concrete strategies and address common challenges in initial teacher education.

### For Experienced Practitioners

Experienced teachers can use Teaching History to develop specific aspects of their practice, stay current with developments in academic history through "Polychronicon," and access inspiration through "Triumphs Show." The journal's themed editions provide concentrated exploration of particular topics, enabling deep engagement with areas of interest.

### For Subject Leaders

Heads of department can use Teaching History to inform curriculum development, support colleagues' professional growth, and build departmental culture around shared professional reading. The journal's treatment of progression, assessment, and curriculum design provides resources for strategic thinking about departmental development.

### For Teacher Educators

Those involved in initial teacher education will find "Move Me On" and the journal's articles on mentoring particularly relevant. The explicit articulation of history-specific pedagogy supports the development of beginning teachers' professional identity as history specialists.

## Future Directions

As Teaching History moves beyond its 200th edition, several themes appear likely to shape its continued evolution:

### Technology and History Education

The journal has begun to address the implications of changing technology for history classrooms, from the use of digital archives to the possibilities and risks of artificial intelligence. This theme is likely to grow in importance as technological change accelerates.

### Environmental History

The inclusion of environmental history in the 200th edition reflects growing recognition that history education must engage with environmental challenges and their historical dimensions. This represents both a curricular expansion and a rethinking of traditional chronological and geographical frameworks.

### Global and Transnational History

Articles on global history and teaching about national identities indicate continued engagement with questions of scale and perspective in history education. The journal is likely to continue exploring how to teach histories that transcend national boundaries whilst maintaining accessibility for school pupils.

### Oracy and Communication

The sustained attention to historical oracy suggests ongoing interest in how pupils communicate historical thinking. This reflects both a disciplinary commitment to argument and debate and a recognition of the importance of spoken language in learning.
