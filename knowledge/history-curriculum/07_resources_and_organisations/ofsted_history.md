# Ofsted and History Education

This document provides a comprehensive overview of Ofsted's approach to inspecting history education in England, drawing on the Education Inspection Framework (EIF) 2019, the History Research Review (2021), and the History Subject Report "Rich Encounters with the Past" (2023). It is designed to support curriculum leaders, subject leaders, and classroom teachers in understanding inspection criteria and developing high-quality history provision.

## The Education Inspection Framework (EIF) 2019

The Education Inspection Framework, introduced in September 2019, marked a significant shift in Ofsted's inspection focus. Rather than concentrating primarily on pupil outcomes and data, the framework places the curriculum at the heart of inspection. This fundamental change has profound implications for how history education is evaluated in English schools.

### The Three Is: Intent, Implementation, and Impact

Ofsted's EIF organises its evaluation of the curriculum around three interconnected concepts that inspectors refer to as "the three Is":

**Intent** refers to the curriculum's design, coverage, and appropriateness. In history, this means inspectors examine what leaders intend pupils to learn, why this content has been selected, and how it builds progressively across key stages. A strong curriculum intent in history goes beyond simply listing topics to be covered. It articulates the substantive knowledge pupils will acquire, the disciplinary knowledge they will develop, and how these elements interconnect over time. Inspectors look for clarity about what makes the curriculum ambitious, coherent, and sequenced towards cumulatively sufficient knowledge.

**Implementation** concerns how the intended curriculum is taught and assessed in practice. This focuses on whether teaching is enabling pupils to learn the intended content and whether assessment is checking what pupils have actually learned rather than merely recording activity. In history, implementation encompasses pedagogical choices, use of resources, development of subject-specific vocabulary, and the ways teachers check for understanding of both substantive and disciplinary concepts.

**Impact** evaluates what pupils have learned as a result of the curriculum. Ofsted emphasises that this goes beyond looking at examination results or data points. Impact in history means assessing whether pupils have gained the intended knowledge, can make connections across topics, understand how historians construct accounts, and can engage meaningfully with historical questions appropriate to their stage of development.

### Quality of Education Judgement

The three Is feed directly into the "quality of education" judgement, one of the four key judgements inspectors make. This judgement replaced the previous focus on "teaching, learning and assessment" and represents a move away from grading individual lessons. Instead, inspectors evaluate the curriculum as a whole, considering how intent translates into implementation and ultimately into impact.

For history, the quality of education judgement means inspectors will consider:

- Whether the curriculum is at least as ambitious as the National Curriculum, even in academies that are not statutorily required to follow it
- How well the curriculum is sequenced so that pupils build knowledge incrementally
- Whether pupils have opportunities to encounter diverse perspectives and a wide range of historical contexts
- The quality of teachers' subject knowledge and its impact on pedagogical choices
- Whether assessment genuinely checks what pupils know and can do

The framework recognises that there are many valid ways to design and teach a high-quality history curriculum. Inspectors are explicitly instructed not to use Ofsted's research reviews or subject reports as checklists. Instead, these documents provide a lens through which inspectors can evaluate the quality of curriculum decisions schools have made.

## The History Research Review (2021)

In July 2021, Ofsted published its Research Review Series: History, a substantial document synthesising research evidence about effective history education. This review serves as the foundation for understanding what inspectors consider when evaluating history provision. It represents the most comprehensive statement of Ofsted's view on the factors contributing to high-quality school history.

### Key Concepts and Definitions

The research review establishes important terminology that inspectors use when discussing history education. Understanding these terms is essential for subject leaders preparing for inspection conversations.

**Substantive knowledge** refers to knowledge about the past itself. This includes knowledge of events, people, places, developments, and periods. Substantive knowledge encompasses the content that constitutes the "stuff" of history—the what of historical study. The review emphasises that this is not merely a list of facts but includes knowledge of historical narratives, chronology, and the characteristics of different periods.

**Disciplinary knowledge** refers to knowledge about how historians study the past and construct historical claims, arguments, and accounts. This is fundamentally different from generic "skills" such as "critical thinking" or "analysis." Disciplinary knowledge in history is substantive knowledge about the methods, approaches, and debates within the discipline of history itself. It includes understanding how evidence is used, how interpretations differ, how causal explanations are constructed, and how historical significance is determined.

The review also distinguishes between:

**Core knowledge**—content that curriculum designers consider most important for pupils to secure in their long-term memory within a particular lesson, topic, or sequence. This is the essential knowledge pupils need to access future learning.

**Hinterland knowledge**—background information that makes core knowledge meaningful by placing it within a rich context. Hinterland knowledge helps pupils understand why things matter and provides the "texture" that makes historical study engaging and meaningful.

**Chronological knowledge**—understanding of broader chronological frameworks, narratives, and features of historical periods. This goes beyond memorising dates to encompass understanding of how periods relate to each other, how change occurs over time, and the characteristic features of different eras.

### Curriculum Progression

The research review emphasises that progress in history is not linear. Pupils do not simply move from "simple" to "complex" topics. Instead, progress involves developing increasingly rich, detailed, and connected knowledge of both substantive and disciplinary concepts.

Effective curriculum progression requires careful decisions about what to emphasise and revisit. Some concepts—such as empire, revolution, or source evaluation—appear repeatedly across the curriculum. Pupils develop understanding of these concepts not through single encounters but through encountering meaningful examples that add nuance and complexity to their mental models.

The review stresses that the ease with which pupils learn new material depends on the range, depth, and security of their prior learning. When pupils have rich, well-connected knowledge, they can access more demanding content and make sophisticated connections. When knowledge is patchy or superficial, pupils struggle to engage with new material meaningfully.

### Pedagogical Implications

The research review has significant implications for how history is taught. It argues against approaches that focus on generic skills divorced from content, emphasising that pupils cannot practise "source analysis" without substantive knowledge of the specific historical context being studied. Similarly, it cautions against activities that generate engagement without developing genuine historical understanding.

Effective pedagogy in history, according to the review, involves:

- Explicit teaching of the knowledge pupils need to engage with historical questions
- Careful sequencing so that pupils encounter concepts in ways that build understanding
- Development of historical vocabulary and conceptual understanding
- Opportunities to encounter how historians work through meaningful examples
- Teaching that helps pupils see connections within and across topics

## Rich Encounters with the Past: The 2023 Subject Report

Building on the 2021 research review, Ofsted published "Rich Encounters with the Past: History Subject Report" in July 2023. This report evaluated the common strengths and weaknesses of history teaching across 50 primary and secondary schools. It provides crucial insights into what inspectors are finding in practice and represents the most current statement of Ofsted's evaluation of history education in England.

### Overall Findings

The report noted significant improvements since Ofsted's last history subject report in 2011. History's position in schools is described as "much more secure now than it was 12 years ago." The previous trend toward the marginalisation of history appears to have been reversed, with most schools providing sufficient time for pupils to study the subject properly.

A notable finding was that the quality gap between primary and secondary history appears to have closed. Primary teachers' subject knowledge was found to be particularly secure given the pressures of teaching multiple subjects. However, the report identified significant variation in quality between schools, with similar strengths and weaknesses appearing across both phases.

### Curriculum Design and Organisation

The subject report evaluated curriculum design through the lens of the research review. It found that the majority of schools were offering curricula at least as ambitious as the National Curriculum, with significant work having been done to develop breadth and ambition.

**Strengths in curriculum design included:**

Schools that had carefully considered what content to include and why. These schools had mapped out the detail of both substantive and disciplinary knowledge pupils would learn, making thoughtful decisions about what to emphasise as core knowledge and what to include as hinterland. Effective curricula focused on developing key concepts over time, revisiting them with increasing complexity.

Schools that had considered curriculum progression carefully, ensuring that content built appropriately on what pupils had learned previously. These schools recognised that success in later topics depends on the quality of earlier learning, and they designed sequences that enabled pupils to develop rich mental models.

Schools that had developed coherent chronological frameworks, helping pupils understand how periods relate to each other and how change occurs over extended time periods. These schools recognised that chronological understanding underpins much historical thinking.

**Areas for development included:**

Schools where curriculum planning lacked specificity about what pupils should learn. In some cases, topics were identified ("the Romans," "the Victorians") without sufficient detail about the specific content pupils would encounter. This lack of specificity led to variation in what different classes learned and made it difficult to assess whether pupils had learned what was intended.

Schools where curriculum sequencing did not adequately support progression. In some cases, pupils encountered complex disciplinary concepts before they had the substantive knowledge needed to engage with them meaningfully. In other cases, important foundational concepts were not revisited or developed.

Schools where the relationship between substantive and disciplinary knowledge was not clearly articulated. These schools sometimes taught substantive content without developing pupils' understanding of how historical knowledge is constructed, or taught "skills" lessons divorced from meaningful historical content.

### Pedagogy

The subject report examined how the intended curriculum was implemented in classrooms, identifying common patterns in effective and less effective practice.

**Effective pedagogy included:**

Teaching that focused on developing pupils' knowledge and understanding rather than generating activity. In these classrooms, pupils engaged with historical questions through developing the knowledge needed to address them, rather than through activities that simulated historical thinking without building genuine understanding.

Explicit attention to developing historical vocabulary and conceptual understanding. Teachers in these classrooms recognised that historical terms (such as "empire," "revolution," "peasantry") are not self-explanatory and that pupils need to develop understanding of these concepts through encountering them in specific contexts.

Careful structuring of learning to support pupils in making connections. This included making explicit links to prior learning, highlighting connections between topics, and helping pupils see how different aspects of historical knowledge relate to each other.

Modelling and explanation that made complex ideas accessible. Effective teachers used their subject knowledge to explain difficult concepts, break down complex processes, and show pupils what sophisticated historical thinking looks like.

**Areas for development included:**

Teaching that focused on surface features of historical practice rather than developing genuine understanding. This included lessons where pupils "analysed sources" without sufficient knowledge of the context, or answered essay questions without the substantive knowledge needed to construct meaningful arguments.

Over-reliance on activities that generated engagement without developing knowledge. While the report acknowledges the importance of engagement, it cautions against activities that are memorable without being educational—such as re-enactments, dressing up, or craft activities that do not develop historical understanding.

Teaching that assumed pupils understood concepts they had not mastered. In some cases, teachers used historical terminology or referenced prior learning without checking that pupils had actually secured the relevant knowledge.

### Assessment

The subject report evaluated both formative and summative assessment practices, finding significant variation in quality.

**Effective assessment included:**

Assessment that genuinely checked what pupils had learned rather than merely recording activity. In effective practice, teachers designed assessments that required pupils to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding, not just that they had completed tasks.

Formative assessment that identified and addressed gaps in knowledge. Effective teachers used questioning, retrieval practice, and other formative strategies to identify what pupils had and had not learned, then adjusted their teaching accordingly.

Summative assessment that sampled appropriately from the curriculum. Effective summative assessments tested pupils on content they had been taught, requiring them to demonstrate knowledge and understanding at an appropriate level of demand.

**Areas for development included:**

Assessment that focused on generic skills or processes rather than specific knowledge. In some schools, assessment criteria focused on generic qualities ("analytical skills," "evaluation") without reference to the specific historical knowledge pupils needed to demonstrate.

Over-reliance on end-of-topic assessments that did not check retention over time. The report notes that some schools assessed pupils immediately after teaching without checking whether knowledge had been retained in long-term memory.

Assessment practices that created unnecessary workload without improving pupil learning. The report cautions against elaborate assessment systems that require extensive teacher time but do not provide useful information about what pupils know and can do.

### School Systems and Leadership

The subject report examined how school leaders and systems supported or hindered history education.

**Effective leadership included:**

Leaders who understood the nature of progress in history and had designed systems accordingly. These leaders recognised that progress in history involves developing rich, connected knowledge and had created conditions that supported this.

Leaders who prioritised subject-specific professional development. Effective leaders ensured that teachers had opportunities to develop their subject knowledge and pedagogical expertise, recognising that generic pedagogical training was insufficient for teaching history well.

Leaders who protected curriculum time and resources. These leaders ensured that history had sufficient curriculum time and that teachers had access to high-quality resources, including appropriate textbooks and materials.

**Areas for development included:**

Leaders who misunderstood the nature of progress in history, sometimes treating it as a linear acquisition of generic skills. These leaders had implemented systems (such as progression grids or assessment criteria) that did not reflect how pupils actually develop historical understanding.

Systems that created unnecessary workload or diverted attention from curriculum development. The report notes cases where whole-school initiatives or assessment requirements distracted from the work of developing curriculum and teaching.

## Deep Dives in History

The EIF introduced "deep dives" as the methodology through which inspectors evaluate the quality of education. In a deep dive, inspectors take a sample of subjects and examine them in detail, looking at curriculum, teaching, assessment, and impact. History is one of the subjects most commonly selected for deep dives, particularly at secondary level.

### What Inspectors Look For

When conducting a deep dive in history, inspectors will typically:

**Review curriculum documentation**, including curriculum maps, schemes of work, and planning documents. They will look for clarity about what pupils are intended to learn, how content is sequenced, and how the curriculum builds knowledge over time. Inspectors are particularly interested in the rationale behind curriculum decisions—why particular content has been selected and how it serves the overall educational aims.

**Speak with curriculum leaders** about the curriculum, its design, and its implementation. These conversations explore the thinking behind curriculum choices, how leaders know the curriculum is being implemented as intended, and how they monitor and improve quality. Inspectors may ask about how the curriculum builds disciplinary knowledge, how it addresses diversity, or how it prepares pupils for future study.

**Observe teaching**, though they will not grade individual lessons. Instead, inspectors consider how teaching contributes to the curriculum, whether pupils are learning what is intended, and how teaching builds knowledge over time. They may look at whether explanations are clear, whether questioning checks understanding effectively, and whether teaching addresses misconceptions.

**Look at pupils' work**, considering whether it reflects the intended curriculum and whether it demonstrates developing knowledge and understanding. Inspectors may look at books from different year groups to see how work develops over time.

**Speak with pupils** about what they have learned, looking for evidence that they have retained and can articulate knowledge from across the curriculum. Inspectors may ask pupils about connections between topics, about how they study history, or about specific content they have studied.

**Review assessment practices**, examining how teachers check what pupils have learned and how assessment information is used to inform teaching.

### Common Deep Dive Questions

While inspectors do not use a standard script, subject leaders report certain questions arising frequently in history deep dives:

- What is the rationale for your curriculum choices? Why have you selected this content?
- How does your curriculum build pupils' disciplinary knowledge over time?
- How do you ensure that pupils develop a coherent chronological framework?
- How do you address gaps in pupils' knowledge?
- How do you assess what pupils have actually learned?
- How do you support teachers in developing the subject knowledge needed to teach your curriculum effectively?
- How do you know the curriculum is being implemented as intended?
- How does your curriculum address diversity and representation?
- What would you expect pupils to know by the end of Year 6/Year 9/Year 11?

### Preparing for a Deep Dive

Preparation for a deep dive should focus on ensuring that the curriculum, its implementation, and its impact are coherent and well-evidenced.

**Documentation**: Ensure curriculum documentation clearly articulates what pupils will learn, when, and why. The rationale for choices should be explicit, and the sequencing should be clear.

**Consistency**: Ensure that what is planned is what is taught. There should be alignment between curriculum documents, teaching materials, classroom practice, and assessment.

**Evidence of impact**: Be prepared to demonstrate what pupils have learned. This might include work in books, assessment information, and the ability of pupils to discuss their learning.

**Conversational readiness**: Curriculum leaders should be prepared to discuss the curriculum in depth, explaining the thinking behind choices and responding to questions about specific aspects of provision.

## Common Strengths and Weaknesses

The 2023 subject report identified patterns of strength and weakness across the schools inspected. Understanding these patterns can help schools evaluate their own provision.

### Common Strengths

**Improved curriculum thinking**: The most significant strength identified was the substantial work schools have done on curriculum development. Most schools now have curricula at least as ambitious as the National Curriculum, with clear attention to what pupils should learn and why.

**Security of subject knowledge**: Primary teachers' subject knowledge was found to be particularly secure, representing a significant improvement from previous years. Secondary teachers generally demonstrated strong subject knowledge, though this varied by individual and topic.

**Chronological frameworks**: Many schools had developed effective chronological frameworks that helped pupils understand how periods relate to each other and how change occurs over time.

**Breadth and diversity**: Schools had generally made progress in ensuring curriculum breadth and addressing issues of representation and diversity in the content taught.

### Common Weaknesses

**Lack of specificity**: A recurring weakness was curriculum planning that lacked detail about what pupils should actually learn. Topics were often identified without the specific content that would be taught, leading to variation between classes and teachers.

**Superficial disciplinary understanding**: Many schools were teaching "skills" or processes without sufficient attention to developing genuine understanding of how historians work. This included teaching source analysis as a generic procedure rather than developing understanding of how historians use evidence in context.

**Disconnection between substantive and disciplinary knowledge**: Some schools were teaching these as separate elements rather than developing pupils' understanding of how historical knowledge is constructed.

**Assessment focused on activity**: Some assessment practices focused on whether pupils had completed tasks rather than whether they had learned what was intended.

## Key Recommendations for Schools

Based on the research review and subject report, schools should consider the following recommendations:

### Curriculum Design

1. **Be specific about content**: Identify the precise substantive knowledge pupils will learn, not just topics. Specify the core knowledge that is essential for future learning and the hinterland knowledge that will make it meaningful.

2. **Plan for progression**: Design curriculum sequences that build knowledge incrementally, revisiting key concepts with increasing complexity. Consider what pupils need to know before encountering new content.

3. **Integrate substantive and disciplinary knowledge**: Plan how pupils will develop understanding of how historians work through meaningful encounters with historical content, not through isolated "skills" lessons.

4. **Develop chronological frameworks**: Ensure pupils develop coherent understanding of how periods relate to each other and how change occurs over extended time periods.

### Pedagogy

5. **Focus on knowledge building**: Ensure teaching is focused on developing pupils' historical knowledge and understanding rather than generating activity or engagement for its own sake.

6. **Teach vocabulary explicitly**: Recognise that historical terms and concepts need to be taught explicitly through meaningful examples rather than assumed or left to incidental acquisition.

7. **Make connections explicit**: Help pupils see how new content relates to what they have learned previously, how different aspects of a topic connect, and how topics relate to each other.

8. **Use modelling and explanation**: Deploy strong subject knowledge through clear explanations, modelling of historical thinking, and careful structuring of learning.

### Assessment

9. **Assess genuine learning**: Design assessments that check whether pupils have learned what was intended, not merely whether they have completed activities.

10. **Check retention over time**: Use assessment strategies that check whether knowledge has been retained in long-term memory, not just immediately after teaching.

11. **Focus assessment on specific knowledge**: Ensure assessment criteria reference specific historical knowledge rather than generic skills or qualities.

### Leadership

12. **Understand history-specific progress**: Ensure leaders understand that progress in history involves developing rich, connected knowledge rather than acquiring generic skills.

13. **Prioritise subject-specific development**: Invest in professional development that builds teachers' subject knowledge and understanding of history pedagogy.

14. **Protect curriculum time and resources**: Ensure history has sufficient time and that teachers have access to high-quality resources that support the intended curriculum.

## Conclusion

Ofsted's approach to inspecting history has evolved significantly since 2019. The current framework, informed by the 2021 research review and the 2023 subject report, emphasises curriculum quality, specificity of content, and the development of rich, connected historical knowledge.

Schools that have invested time in carefully designing their history curriculum—being specific about what pupils will learn, planning for progression, and ensuring teaching builds genuine understanding—are well-positioned for inspection. The key is to ensure alignment between intent, implementation, and impact: to plan a thoughtful curriculum, teach it effectively, and be able to demonstrate that pupils have learned what was intended.

The message from Ofsted is clear: there is no single approved way to teach history. Schools have significant freedom to make curriculum choices. What matters is that these choices are thoughtful, purposeful, and focused on enabling pupils to develop rich encounters with the past.
