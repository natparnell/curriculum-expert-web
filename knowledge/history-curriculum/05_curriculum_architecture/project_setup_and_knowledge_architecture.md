# Project Setup and Knowledge Architecture

## Introduction

Effective history curriculum design begins long before individual lesson planning. It requires careful project setup and the construction of robust knowledge architecture that will support pupil learning across the entire key stage and beyond. This foundational phase determines how substantive and disciplinary knowledge interrelate, how concepts develop over time, and how pupils build increasingly sophisticated mental models of the past.

The Ofsted Education Inspection Framework (EIF) emphasises the importance of curriculum intent, implementation, and impact. In history, this translates into making deliberate, principled decisions about what knowledge to include, how to sequence it, and how to ensure that pupils develop both breadth of understanding and depth of historical thinking. Curriculum leaders must act as architects, designing structures that enable pupils to make sense of the past and develop the disciplinary capabilities necessary to engage with historical argument and debate.

This guidance examines the essential components of history curriculum project setup and knowledge architecture, drawing on research from Ofsted, the Historical Association, and leading curriculum theorists to provide a comprehensive framework for curriculum design.

## Establishing Curriculum Intent

### Defining the Purpose of History Education

Before selecting content or planning sequences, curriculum leaders must establish clear intent: what do we want pupils to know, understand, and be able to do by the end of their history education? This question requires schools to articulate their rationale for history as a distinct subject within the broader curriculum.

Ofsted's research review series on history (2021) identifies several purposes that underpin high-quality history education. Pupils should develop knowledge of the past that enables them to understand their place in the world and in the long story of human development. They should encounter diverse human experiences across time and place, recognising both striking similarities and vast differences. Crucially, pupils should learn how accounts of the past arise and are constructed, understanding that historical knowledge is provisional, contested, and subject to revision as new evidence emerges and interpretations shift.

Schools must balance these purposes according to their context and the needs of their pupils. Some may emphasise the contribution of history to pupils' cultural literacy and sense of identity. Others may prioritise the development of critical thinking and evaluative capabilities. Most effective curricula address multiple purposes while maintaining coherent progression towards clearly defined endpoints.

### The Distinction Between Substantive and Disciplinary Knowledge

Central to curriculum intent is understanding the relationship between substantive knowledge (knowledge of the past) and disciplinary knowledge (knowledge of how historians study the past and construct accounts). The Ofsted research review stresses that both are essential and interdependent: pupils cannot engage in historical thinking without substantial knowledge of the periods they study, while substantive knowledge remains inert without the disciplinary frameworks that give it meaning.

**Substantive knowledge** encompasses:

- **Specific events, people, and developments**: Particular occurrences such as the Norman Conquest, the Industrial Revolution, or the campaign for women's suffrage
- **Substantive concepts**: Abstract concepts including empire, revolution, democracy, monarchy, invasion, trade, and rights that appear across multiple historical contexts
- **Period knowledge**: Understanding of the characteristic features of historical periods, including their social, political, economic, and cultural dimensions
- **Chronological frameworks**: Knowledge of broad developments and the relationships between periods

**Disciplinary knowledge** includes:

- **How historical claims are constituted**: Understanding how historians use evidence to construct arguments and how they establish validity
- **The nature of historical evidence**: Recognition of the relationship between surviving traces of the past and the questions historians ask of them
- **Interpretation and debate**: Awareness that historical accounts are constructed and contested, and that historians reach different conclusions from the same evidence
- **Historical reasoning**: The ability to deploy second-order concepts including causation, change and continuity, similarity and difference, and significance

Curriculum intent must specify how these two domains will develop in relation to each other. Neither can be an afterthought: substantive knowledge must be selected with disciplinary purposes in mind, while disciplinary learning must be grounded in meaningful encounters with substantive content.

### Long-Term Planning: The Big Picture

Curriculum intent finds expression in long-term planning that maps the entire span of pupils' history education. This planning should identify the major topics, enquiries, and disciplinary focuses that will occupy each term, ensuring appropriate coverage of the national curriculum while allowing for depth and coherence.

Effective long-term plans balance overview and depth. Pupils need sufficient overview to develop chronological frameworks and understand broad developments, alongside opportunities for depth study that enable sophisticated disciplinary engagement. The national curriculum for Key Stage 3 requires that pupils "identify significant events, make connections, draw contrasts, and analyse trends" – capabilities that require both breadth of knowledge and opportunities for sustained focus.

Long-term planning should also identify where substantive concepts will be encountered and revisited. Concepts such as empire, revolution, or democracy cannot be taught once and considered complete. Pupils need multiple encounters in different contexts, each building upon and refining previous understanding. Curriculum architecture must map these revisits explicitly, ensuring that conceptual development is planned rather than left to chance.

## Building Knowledge Architecture

### The Architecture-Agency Distinction

Michael Young and colleagues' concept of "powerful knowledge" provides a valuable framework for thinking about curriculum architecture. Powerful knowledge differs from the everyday knowledge pupils bring to school: it is specialised, systematic, and enables pupils to think in ways that would be impossible without formal education. In history, powerful knowledge includes both the substantive content that provides access to human experience across time and space, and the disciplinary understanding that enables critical engagement with historical claims.

Curriculum architecture concerns how this powerful knowledge is organised and sequenced to support pupil learning. Architecture is not simply a matter of arranging topics in chronological order. It involves designing structures that enable pupils to build increasingly complex mental models, make connections between different areas of knowledge, and develop sophisticated disciplinary capabilities.

### Schema Building and Mental Models

Contemporary cognitive science emphasises the importance of schema in learning. Schemas are organised frameworks of knowledge that enable us to process new information, make connections, and engage in higher-order thinking. In history education, pupils must develop increasingly complex schemas that allow them to understand the past in sophisticated ways.

Curriculum architecture supports schema building through several mechanisms:

**Spiral Curriculum Design**: Key concepts and disciplinary approaches are revisited multiple times, each encounter building upon and refining previous understanding. This is not mere repetition but planned progression towards greater sophistication.

**Interleaving**: Rather than studying topics in isolation, the curriculum is designed so that pupils regularly return to and connect with previously studied material. This strengthens memory and supports the development of overview understanding.

**Elaboration**: Pupils are encouraged to develop and extend their understanding by making connections, explaining relationships, and applying knowledge in new contexts. Curriculum architecture creates opportunities for such elaboration through carefully designed enquiries and assessments.

**Concrete to Abstract Progression**: Abstract concepts are introduced through concrete examples and specific contexts before pupils are asked to work with them at higher levels of generality. Curriculum architecture ensures appropriate grounding before abstraction.

### Sequencing Principles

How topics and concepts are sequenced profoundly affects what pupils can learn. While chronological ordering provides one obvious sequencing principle, effective curriculum architecture employs multiple considerations:

**Chronological Sequencing**: Studying periods in broadly chronological order supports the development of chronological frameworks and enables pupils to understand causation and change over time. However, rigid adherence to chronology may not always serve learning best – sometimes thematic or conceptual organisation may be more effective.

**Threshold Concepts**: Some knowledge serves as a gateway to understanding other areas. Curriculum architecture should identify these threshold concepts and ensure they are addressed before dependent knowledge. For example, understanding the feudal system may be prerequisite to understanding medieval politics and society.

**Cognitive Load**: The complexity of new material must be managed so that pupils can process and integrate it effectively. Architecture should sequence from simpler to more complex content, building the mental models that enable sophisticated engagement.

**Motivation and Engagement**: While not the only consideration, pupil motivation matters. Architecture should include strategic positioning of engaging content that generates interest and investment in the subject.

**Disciplinary Progression**: Disciplinary capabilities develop over time, and architecture must ensure that pupils encounter appropriate challenges. Early work may focus on understanding that historical claims require evidence; later work may engage with the contested nature of interpretation and the provisional character of historical knowledge.

### Conceptual Progression

Substantive concepts require particular attention in curriculum architecture. Concepts such as empire, revolution, democracy, and rights are complex and multifaceted. Pupils cannot grasp their full significance through single encounters.

Effective architecture maps conceptual progression explicitly:

**Initial Encounter**: Pupils meet a concept in a specific, concrete context. For example, they might encounter 'empire' through studying the Roman Empire in Britain, understanding its basic characteristics – military conquest, administrative control, cultural influence.

**Revisiting and Comparing**: The concept is encountered again in different contexts. Pupils might study the British Empire, comparing and contrasting it with their understanding of Rome. What is similar? What differs? How do empires vary across time and space?

**Abstract Understanding**: Through multiple encounters, pupils develop more abstract understanding of the concept. They can identify empires in unfamiliar contexts, understand the conditions that give rise to empires, and evaluate their significance.

**Critical Engagement**: Ultimately, pupils can engage critically with the concept itself – questioning how it is defined, examining its limitations, and understanding how historians have debated its application.

Curriculum architecture must ensure sufficient encounters with key concepts, in appropriately varied contexts, to support this progression.

## Implementing the Curriculum

### From Architecture to Enquiry

Curriculum architecture provides the framework, but implementation requires translating that architecture into classroom practice. The enquiry approach has become central to effective history teaching, structuring learning around questions that require pupils to deploy knowledge and disciplinary capabilities.

Enquiries should be designed with the curriculum architecture in mind. Each enquiry contributes to the broader architectural goals, whether by introducing new substantive knowledge, developing understanding of a key concept, or building disciplinary capabilities. Enquiries are not free-standing units but integral components of the larger structure.

Effective enquiries typically:

- Begin with a compelling question that motivates learning and requires genuine historical thinking to answer
- Provide access to appropriately challenging sources and evidence
- Require pupils to deploy both substantive knowledge and disciplinary capabilities
- Build towards a substantial outcome – an essay, presentation, debate, or other performance of understanding
- Make explicit connections to prior and future learning

### Assessment as Architecture

Assessment should be integral to curriculum architecture, not an afterthought. The purposes of assessment in history include:

**Diagnostic Assessment**: Identifying what pupils already know and can do, enabling teaching to build on existing knowledge rather than starting from assumptions.

**Formative Assessment**: Providing ongoing feedback that supports learning. In history, this includes attention to both substantive understanding (do pupils know the relevant content?) and disciplinary capability (can they use evidence, construct arguments, engage with interpretations?).

**Summative Assessment**: Evaluating learning at significant points, providing information about whether pupils have achieved intended outcomes and where curriculum or teaching may need adjustment.

Assessment architecture should be planned alongside content and sequencing. What will be assessed, when, and how? How will assessment support the development of both substantive and disciplinary knowledge? How will assessment generate information useful for curriculum improvement?

### The Role of Resources

Resources mediate between curriculum architecture and classroom implementation. Textbooks, source collections, visual materials, and digital resources all shape what is possible in the classroom. Curriculum leaders must evaluate and select resources with architectural goals in mind:

- Do resources provide accurate, up-to-date substantive knowledge?
- Do they include appropriate and accessible source material?
- Do they support the development of disciplinary capabilities?
- Are they aligned with the planned progression in the curriculum?
- Do they represent diverse perspectives and voices?

Resources should be selected deliberately as part of architectural planning, not accumulated ad hoc or chosen primarily for convenience.

### Professional Development

Curriculum architecture requires teachers who understand both the content and the disciplinary approaches of history. Professional development should support teachers in:

- Understanding the curriculum architecture and their role within it
- Developing their own historical knowledge, particularly for periods or topics they have not previously taught
- Building expertise in history-specific pedagogy, including the teaching of disciplinary concepts and the use of evidence
- Engaging with historical scholarship and curriculum debates

Investment in professional development is essential for curriculum implementation. Architecture on paper means little without teachers capable of bringing it to life in classrooms.

## Challenges and Considerations

### Managing Competing Priorities

History curriculum design involves balancing multiple competing priorities. Breadth must be balanced against depth; disciplinary development against substantive coverage; canonical content against diverse perspectives; engagement against challenge. There is no single correct balance – decisions must be made thoughtfully in light of context and the needs of particular pupils.

Curriculum leaders should make these decisions explicit and principled. Why this selection of content rather than alternatives? Why this sequence? Why this balance between overview and depth? Articulating the rationale supports consistency, enables evaluation, and facilitates communication with stakeholders.

### Inclusion and Access

Curriculum architecture must consider how all pupils will access powerful knowledge. This includes attention to:

- **Reading demands**: History is a text-heavy subject, and pupils must be able to read and comprehend historical writing. Architecture should build the reading capabilities necessary for historical learning.
- **Vocabulary**: History involves technical and academic vocabulary that may be unfamiliar. Key terms should be identified, taught explicitly, and revisited regularly.
- **Prior knowledge**: Pupils arrive with varying levels of prior knowledge. Architecture should not assume knowledge that some pupils may lack, while ensuring that all pupils are appropriately challenged.
- **Cultural relevance**: The curriculum should engage pupils from diverse backgrounds, connecting their experiences and heritage to the content while also expanding their horizons beyond the familiar.

### Responding to Inspection

Ofsted inspection under the EIF focuses on the intent, implementation, and impact of the curriculum. History subject leaders should be prepared to articulate:

- What the curriculum intends pupils to know and be able to do
- How the curriculum is structured to achieve these intentions
- How implementation is monitored and supported
- What evidence demonstrates that pupils are learning and achieving intended outcomes

Preparation for inspection is not about creating documentation for its own sake but about having clear, shared understanding of the curriculum and its rationale. This clarity supports consistent implementation and continuous improvement.

### Continuous Review and Development

Curriculum architecture is not a one-time project but an ongoing process of review and refinement. History scholarship continues to develop, pedagogical understanding advances, and the needs of pupils change. Curriculum leaders should establish processes for:

- Regular review of curriculum effectiveness
- Engagement with new historical scholarship and educational research
- Responding to assessment information about pupil learning
- Collaborative development among the history teaching team

The most effective curricula evolve in response to experience while maintaining coherent architectural principles.

## Conclusion

Project setup and knowledge architecture are foundational to effective history education. Curriculum leaders must act as architects, designing structures that enable pupils to build powerful knowledge of the past and develop the disciplinary capabilities to engage critically with historical claims. This requires principled decisions about content, thoughtful sequencing that supports conceptual development, and careful planning for implementation through enquiry-based teaching.

The Ofsted Education Inspection Framework provides a helpful structure for thinking about curriculum quality through the lens of intent, implementation, and impact. In history, intent must address both substantive and disciplinary knowledge, implementation requires pedagogical approaches specific to the discipline, and impact is measured by what pupils know, understand, and can do as a result of their history education.

By investing in robust curriculum architecture, schools create the conditions for pupils to develop rich, meaningful understanding of the past – knowledge that illuminates the present, develops critical thinking, and equips young people to participate thoughtfully in the ongoing human story.
