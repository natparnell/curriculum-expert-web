# Inspection Framework for History

## Overview

The Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted) inspects state schools in England using the Education Inspection Framework (EIF), which came into effect on 2 September 2019. The framework was renewed in September 2025, with significant changes to inspection methodology, including the removal of single-word judgement grades and the replacement with detailed report cards. Understanding how this framework applies specifically to history education is essential for curriculum leaders preparing for inspection.

Ofsted's approach to inspecting history has evolved considerably since the landmark reports "History in the Balance" (2007) and "History for All" (2011). The July 2023 subject report "Rich Encounters with the Past" represents the most comprehensive recent evaluation of history education, providing clear indicators of what inspectors look for when evaluating the quality of history provision in schools.

## The Education Inspection Framework (EIF): Core Principles

### The Three Is: Intent, Implementation, and Impact

The EIF introduced three interconnected concepts—often called the "Three Is"—through which inspectors evaluate the quality of education, including history:

**Intent** refers to what leaders intend pupils to learn in history. This includes the curriculum's scope, ambition, and sequencing. For history specifically, intent encompasses:
- The breadth and depth of historical periods studied
- The balance between British, local, and world history
- The development of both substantive and disciplinary knowledge over time
- The identification of core knowledge and concepts that support future learning

**Implementation** concerns how the intended curriculum is taught. In history, this includes:
- Pedagogical choices that help pupils learn and remember important content
- How teachers make the past meaningful through explanations and carefully selected examples
- Approaches to developing pupils' chronological knowledge and understanding of historical concepts
- Methods for teaching disciplinary knowledge about how historians study the past

**Impact** measures what pupils know, remember, and can do as a result of the history curriculum. Inspectors evaluate:
- Whether pupils have developed rich, connected knowledge of the past
- Whether pupils can place their learning within broader chronological frameworks
- The security of pupils' understanding of historical concepts and disciplinary approaches
- Whether pupils hold misconceptions about how historians construct accounts

Crucially, Ofsted does not grade intent, implementation, and impact separately. Inspectors draw on all evidence gathered, using professional judgement to form an overall evaluation of the quality of education.

### Quality of Education Judgement

The "Quality of Education" judgement replaced the previous separate judgements for teaching, learning, assessment, and outcomes. This holistic approach recognises that these elements are interconnected. For history, this means inspectors consider how curriculum design, teaching, assessment, and pupil learning work together to produce high-quality historical education.

## The Deep Dive Methodology

### What Is an Ofsted Deep Dive?

A deep dive is an in-depth examination of a subject by the inspection team. For history, this involves:

- **Evaluation of curriculum documentation**: Inspectors review curriculum plans, schemes of work, and assessment materials
- **Lesson observations**: Multiple history lessons are observed across different year groups
- **Work scrutiny**: Inspectors examine pupils' work in history books to evaluate progress and the quality of learning over time
- **Discussions with curriculum leaders**: In-depth conversations about curriculum intent, rationale for content choices, and approaches to implementation
- **Pupil interviews**: Inspectors speak with pupils about what they have learned, what they remember, and their understanding of historical concepts
- **Discussions with teachers**: Conversations about subject knowledge, pedagogical approaches, and assessment practices

### Changes to Deep Dives from September 2024

A significant change to inspection practice occurred in September 2024: **ungraded inspections no longer include subject deep dives**. This change was designed to reduce the burden on school leaders and allow inspectors more time and flexibility to understand the school's context and priorities.

Under the renewed framework (from November 2025):
- Graded inspections will continue to include deep dives
- Ungraded inspections use "extended learning walks" instead of deep dives
- The curriculum remains important, but inspectors no longer suggest a subject for deep dive
- Schools receive detailed report cards instead of single-word grades (Outstanding, Good, Requires Improvement, Inadequate)

### What Inspectors Look for in a History Deep Dive

#### 1. Curriculum Design and Organisation

Inspectors evaluate whether:

- **Time allocation is sufficient**: Most effective primary schools allocate between 60-90 minutes of history per fortnight
- **The curriculum is broad and ambitious**: Pupils study a range of historical periods from British, local, and world history
- **Knowledge is carefully sequenced**: The curriculum builds pupils' knowledge systematically so they can access increasingly ambitious content
- **Core knowledge is identified**: Leaders have identified the most important content and concepts that support future learning
- **Recurring concepts are developed**: Concepts such as empire, tax, trade, and invasion are encountered repeatedly, with pupils developing increasingly complex understanding over time

The 2023 subject report found that in nearly all primary schools visited, history was taught as a separate subject, with most having moved away from topic-based approaches. Leaders had typically made sure that enough time was allocated to teach a broad and ambitious history curriculum.

#### 2. Substantive Knowledge

Substantive knowledge refers to knowledge about the past. Inspectors evaluate:

**Chronological Knowledge**
Inspectors look for evidence that pupils are developing a secure "mental timeline" of the past. This includes:
- Knowledge of broad chronological frameworks and historical periods
- Understanding of where specific topics fit within longer-term developments
- Ability to place new learning in context using chronological knowledge

The 2023 report found that in most schools, leaders recognised the importance of chronological knowledge, and there had been significant recent work on this area. However, some schools overemphasised chronological knowledge to the detriment of other important aspects.

**Knowledge of Terms, Concepts, and Phenomena**
Inspectors evaluate whether pupils are developing secure knowledge of recurring concepts such as:
- Power and authority
- Religion and belief
- Trade and economy
- Society and social structures
- Conflict and peace

The most effective schools plan learning journeys that build pupils' knowledge of these concepts through meaningful examples across different periods. Simply identifying themes retrospectively in existing curriculum content is less effective than deliberately planning how pupils will develop increasingly complex understanding.

**Topic Knowledge**
Inspectors assess whether pupils have secure knowledge of the specific times and places they study. This includes:
- Understanding of the historical context
- Knowledge of important developments and events
- Understanding of people's values and attitudes in the period

The 2023 report found that schools were particularly successful in developing topic knowledge for local history, often making meaningful connections between local developments and wider historical changes.

#### 3. Disciplinary Knowledge

Disciplinary knowledge—understanding how historians study the past—has been identified as an area of weakness in many schools. Inspectors evaluate:

**Teaching of Historical Enquiry**
Effective schools teach pupils about how historians construct claims and accounts through specific examples. Inspectors look for:
- Valid historical enquiry questions that frame topics
- Teaching that shows how historians use different types of sources
- Development of pupils' understanding of how historical interpretations are formed
- Avoidance of oversimplified approaches, such as teaching pupils to label sources as simply "reliable" or "unreliable"

**Common Misconceptions to Avoid**
The 2023 report identified several problematic approaches that inspectors look out for:
- Asking pupils to make complex historical judgements without sufficient knowledge to do so meaningfully
- Teaching pupils to "come up with their own interpretations" without understanding how historians construct interpretations
- Conflating historical significance with "impact"
- Teaching pupils to spot "bias" in sources using simplistic criteria
- Presenting historians as simple "fact-checkers" or conflating historical work with archaeology

**Evidence and Sources**
Inspectors evaluate whether pupils understand how historians use sources to construct accounts. In around two-thirds of schools visited for the 2023 report, teachers focused on pupils forming their own judgements about sources without first securing the knowledge needed to do this meaningfully.

#### 4. Pedagogy

Inspectors evaluate whether teachers' pedagogical decisions help pupils learn new material effectively. This includes:

**Teacher Explanations**
In the most effective schools, teachers use clear explanations to explore new information, drawing on secure subject knowledge to make the past meaningful for pupils.

**Building on Prior Knowledge**
Effective teaching builds on what pupils already know, using well-selected stories and examples to make abstract ideas meaningful.

**Support for Pupils with SEND**
Inspectors evaluate whether support for pupils with special educational needs and/or disabilities focuses on building knowledge and skills for long-term curriculum access, rather than simply adapting immediate tasks.

**Avoiding Anachronistic Activities**
Inspectors look out for activities that distract from historical learning, such as:
- Anachronistic writing tasks (e.g., writing newspaper reports on Viking invasions)
- Present-focused judgements (e.g., asking "Who was the best monarch?" or "Were Viking punishments fair?")
- Activities that encourage pupils to apply modern values to past societies

#### 5. Assessment

Assessment in history was identified in the 2023 report as not fully developed in most primary schools. Inspectors evaluate:

- Whether assessment identifies specific gaps and misconceptions in pupils' knowledge
- Whether teachers check that pupils have secure knowledge of important content and concepts
- Whether assessment focuses on broad judgements about progress or identifies specific knowledge gaps

In around half of secondary schools visited, teachers used assessment effectively to identify gaps and misconceptions in the most important knowledge. In the other half, this was not the case.

#### 6. School Systems and Leadership

Inspectors evaluate whole-school systems and their impact on history education:

- Whether leaders understand how pupils get better in history
- Whether curriculum time is protected and valued
- Whether professional development supports teachers' subject knowledge and pedagogical expertise
- Whether policies (such as marking policies) support or hinder effective history teaching

The 2023 report found that in some schools, leaders accepted superficial evidence of quality, such as the presence of retrieval quizzes, without evaluating whether these were actually helping pupils develop richer, more secure knowledge.

## Key Findings from "Rich Encounters with the Past" (2023)

### Overall Assessment

Ofsted's July 2023 history subject report found that history education in schools is "much more secure than it was 12 years ago." The position of history in schools has improved significantly since concerns were raised in 2007 and 2011 about marginalisation and integrity.

Key findings included:

1. **The gap between primary and secondary history has closed**: Primary school teachers demonstrated secure subject knowledge despite the pressures of teaching multiple subjects.

2. **Significant curriculum development has occurred**: Most schools have invested substantial time in developing broad, ambitious history curriculums.

3. **Significant differences remain between schools**: While overall quality has improved, there are still substantial variations in the quality of history education.

4. **Common strengths and weaknesses**: Similar strengths and weaknesses were found in both primary and secondary settings.

### Areas of Strength

**Curriculum Time and Status**
- History was highly valued by leaders and teachers in most schools
- Pupils were given enough time to study the subject properly
- The trend towards erosion of history as a distinct subject has been reversed

**Curriculum Breadth**
- Pupils studied a wide range of historical periods
- In almost all schools, the curriculum was carefully designed to develop pupils' knowledge
- Local history was particularly well taught in most primary schools

**Support for SEND Pupils**
- Support for pupils with special educational needs was a priority in all schools visited

### Areas for Development

**Disciplinary Knowledge**
Curriculum plans relating to disciplinary knowledge were typically not ambitious enough. The complexity of disciplinary traditions and approaches was often misrepresented. Very few schools enabled pupils to develop complex knowledge over time of how historians study the past.

**Assessment**
Assessment was not fully developed in most primary schools. Teachers commonly made broad judgements about progress without identifying specific gaps and misconceptions.

**Superficial Features vs. Deep Learning**
In many schools, superficial features of curriculum plans or lessons were too readily assumed to be evidence of quality. Examples include:
- "Golden threads" identified in curriculum plans but not implemented effectively
- Lesson features such as retrieval quizzes mistaken for evidence of secure learning
- Broad curriculum aims that did not help teachers make decisions about teaching

**Misconceptions About Historical Enquiry**
In a significant minority of lessons observed, teachers encouraged pupils to come up with their own judgements when they lacked the knowledge to do so meaningfully. This often left pupils with significant gaps and misconceptions.

## Preparing for History Inspection: Practical Guidance

### Curriculum Documentation

**Intent Statements**
- Articulate clearly what pupils will know and be able to do at each stage
- Identify the core knowledge and concepts that support future learning
- Explain the rationale for content choices and sequencing decisions
- Avoid broad, ill-defined aims that do not guide teaching decisions

**Curriculum Maps**
- Show how topics are sequenced to build knowledge over time
- Indicate where recurring concepts are encountered and developed
- Demonstrate coverage of national curriculum requirements
- Show balance between British, local, and world history

### Evidence to Prepare

**Pupils' Work**
- Ensure books show progression over time
- Evidence of revisiting and building on prior knowledge
- Examples of extended writing that demonstrates secure historical knowledge
- Evidence of how feedback has led to improvement

**Assessment Information**
- Records of what has been checked (not just what has been taught)
- Evidence of how gaps and misconceptions have been identified and addressed
- Examples of how assessment has informed teaching decisions

**Curriculum Leaders' Knowledge**
Curriculum leaders should be able to discuss:
- The rationale for curriculum choices
- How the curriculum builds pupils' knowledge over time
- Common misconceptions pupils hold and how these are addressed
- How teachers' subject knowledge is developed

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Teaching to the inspection**: Focus on developing genuine historical knowledge rather than creating performative lesson features

2. **Confusing activity with learning**: Ensure that lesson activities are designed to secure knowledge, not simply engage pupils

3. **Overemphasis on skills over knowledge**: Avoid curriculum plans that focus on developing "historical skills" without the substantive and disciplinary knowledge needed to exercise them

4. **Generic assessment**: Avoid assessment systems that generate data without identifying specific gaps in historical knowledge

5. **Present-focused questions**: Ensure enquiry questions help pupils understand past societies on their own terms, not simply apply modern values

## The Renewed Framework (2025)

From November 2025, Ofsted implements a renewed Education Inspection Framework with significant changes:

### Report Cards Replace Single-Word Grades

Schools will no longer receive overall grades of Outstanding, Good, Requires Improvement, or Inadequate. Instead, they will receive detailed report cards that:
- Provide a fuller picture of the school's strengths and areas for development
- Include findings for each judgement area without overall grades
- Focus on what the school does well and what could be improved

### Implications for History

While the methodology for evaluating history specifically remains similar, schools should be aware that:
- The removal of deep dives from ungraded inspections reduces pressure for these inspections
- Graded inspections will continue to include thorough evaluation of curriculum quality
- The focus remains on what pupils know and remember, not on lesson features or documentation

## Recommendations from Ofsted

The "Rich Encounters with the Past" report made specific recommendations for schools:

### For Schools

1. **Understand the generative power of knowledge**: Recognise how layers of historical knowledge interact so that pupils' knowledge of past societies, recurring concepts, and chronological frameworks help them learn new topics more easily.

2. **Identify the most important content**: Ensure the curriculum identifies core knowledge and concepts that support future learning, so teachers can emphasise these in teaching.

3. **Make pedagogical decisions that emphasise important content**: Teachers should be confident in emphasising important content and concepts in meaningful ways, revisiting these regularly so pupils develop secure knowledge.

4. **Use assessment to identify gaps**: Assessment should regularly and systematically check that pupils are secure in knowledge of important content and concepts, so gaps and misconceptions can be addressed quickly.

5. **Focus SEND support on curriculum access**: Support for pupils with SEND should focus on their ability to access the breadth and depth of the curriculum over time, not just on completing immediate tasks.

6. **Provide broad and rich encounters with the past**: The curriculum should give pupils broad encounters with the past through different times, places, societies, people, groups, and experiences, viewed through political, social, economic, and cultural lenses.

7. **Develop meaningful disciplinary knowledge**: The curriculum should enable pupils to develop meaningful and increasingly complex knowledge about how historians study the past, avoiding reductive or misleading representations.

8. **Develop teachers systematically**: Leaders should plan systematically to develop teachers' knowledge of content and how to teach history effectively.

9. **Assure quality meaningfully**: Leaders should assure quality by assessing what pupils learn and remember over time, including the richness, connectedness, and complexity of their knowledge.

### For Initial Teacher Education

The report also made recommendations for those training new teachers:

- Teachers should understand how pupils get better in history and know how to develop pupils' knowledge so they can access increasingly ambitious curriculum content
- Teachers should understand how to help pupils develop meaningful disciplinary knowledge and be aware of misconceptions that can develop if the work of historians is misrepresented

## Conclusion

Understanding the inspection framework for history requires more than knowing what inspectors look for during deep dives. It requires a genuine commitment to developing pupils' historical knowledge in all its dimensions—substantive, disciplinary, and chronological. The schools that fare best in inspection are those where leaders and teachers have thought deeply about how pupils learn history, how knowledge builds over time, and how to create meaningful encounters with the richness of the past
