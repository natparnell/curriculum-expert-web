# Assessment Without Levels in History

## Introduction

The removal of National Curriculum levels in 2014 marked the most significant change to assessment in English schools for over two decades. Following the recommendations of the Commission on Assessment Without Levels, chaired by John McIntosh, schools were given the freedom—and the challenge—to develop their own assessment frameworks. This shift has had profound implications for history teaching, requiring departments to think deeply about what progress in historical understanding actually looks like and how it can be meaningfully measured.

This knowledge file examines the principles underpinning assessment without levels, explores various approaches adopted by history departments, and considers the ongoing challenges and emerging best practices in assessing pupil progress in history from Key Stage 1 through to Key Stage 4.

## Historical Context: Why Levels Were Removed

### The Problems with the Levels System

National Curriculum levels were introduced in 1988 as part of the original National Curriculum. Over time, however, significant problems emerged:

**Over-assessment and labelling:** Levels became a tool for constant measurement rather than supporting learning. Pupils were frequently given level labels that masked complex profiles of understanding—often knowing more about certain historical periods while struggling with conceptual understanding, or vice versa.

**Incomplete understanding:** A pupil achieving "Level 5" might have a partial or incomplete grasp of the concepts ostensibly required at that level. The single-number system concealed the complexity of developing historical understanding.

**Interference with teaching:** Assessment became an end in itself. Teachers felt pressured to "level" every piece of work, leading to an overemphasis on generating assessment data rather than focusing on rich historical learning experiences.

**Inappropriate comparability:** Levels implied comparability across subjects that did not exist. Progression in history differs fundamentally from progression in mathematics or science, yet the level system suggested otherwise.

### The Commission on Assessment Without Levels

The independent Commission on Assessment Without Levels was established in 2014 to advise schools on developing effective assessment systems in the new curriculum landscape. Their final report, published in September 2015, established key principles that continue to guide assessment practice today.

**Core Principles from the Commission:**

- Assessment should be integral to teaching and learning, not a separate activity
- Assessment information should be meaningful and useful to pupils, parents, and teachers
- Schools should have the freedom to design assessment approaches appropriate to their context
- Assessment should focus on whether pupils have understood curriculum content and can apply their knowledge
- Systems should avoid excessive workload for teachers

The Commission emphasised that there should be no expectation for schools to use any specific system, nor should they attempt to recreate levels under a different name. Instead, schools were encouraged to focus on developing deep understanding of curriculum content.

## Developing Assessment Systems in History

### Starting Points: What Are We Assessing?

Effective assessment in history must begin with clarity about what constitutes progress in the subject. Unlike subjects with hierarchical knowledge structures, history involves multiple interconnected dimensions of development:

**Substantive Knowledge:** What pupils know about the past—key events, individuals, developments, and periods. This includes both overview knowledge (the broad sweep of history) and depth knowledge (detailed understanding of specific topics).

**Disciplinary Knowledge:** How pupils understand history as a discipline—the concepts historians use to analyse and interpret the past. This includes understanding evidence, cause and consequence, change and continuity, similarity and difference, and historical significance.

**Procedural Knowledge:** How pupils actually do history—the processes of historical enquiry, including asking questions, analysing sources, constructing arguments, and communicating conclusions.

**Historical Literacy:** The ability to communicate historical understanding effectively through writing, discussion, and other forms of expression.

A robust assessment system must attend to all four dimensions, recognising that progress may be uneven. A pupil might develop strong substantive knowledge while still struggling with causal explanation, or demonstrate sophisticated source analysis while having gaps in chronological understanding.

### Common Assessment Approaches in History

#### 1. Mastery and Age-Related Expectations

Many schools have adopted mastery-based approaches, influenced by the principles embedded in the National Curriculum programmes of study. In this model:

- Pupils are expected to achieve a secure understanding of curriculum content before moving on
- Assessment focuses on whether pupils have "mastered" specific knowledge and skills
- Judgements are typically binary (secure/not yet secure) rather than graded
- Progress is measured by the breadth and depth of curriculum coverage

**Strengths:** Clear focus on curriculum content; encourages thorough teaching; manageable workload; aligns well with the National Curriculum's emphasis on depth of understanding.

**Challenges:** Can be difficult to define "mastery" precisely; may not capture the incremental nature of historical understanding; binary judgements may oversimplify complex learning journeys.

#### 2. Progression Models and Developmental Continua

Some departments have developed detailed progression frameworks that describe how historical thinking develops over time. These typically identify stages or milestones in the development of disciplinary concepts.

For example, understanding of historical evidence might be described as developing from:
- **Early stages:** Recognising that sources provide information about the past
- **Developing:** Understanding that sources have limitations and may contradict each other
- **Secure:** Evaluating source reliability based on provenance and context
- **Advanced:** Constructing arguments that weigh multiple sources against each other

**Strengths:** Captures the developmental nature of historical understanding; helps teachers identify next steps; provides clear progression pathways.

**Challenges:** Risk of recreating levels under different names; requires significant professional development; progression is not always linear.

#### 3. Threshold Concepts

Drawing on work by educational researchers including Meyer and Land, some history educators have identified "threshold concepts"—core ideas that, once understood, transform a pupil's view of the subject. In history, these might include:

- The idea that historical accounts are constructed, not simply discovered
- Understanding that the past is different from the present in fundamental ways
- Recognition that historical significance is attributed, not inherent

Assessment in this model focuses on whether pupils have crossed these conceptual thresholds.

**Strengths:** Focuses on transformative learning moments; aligns with how historians understand the discipline.

**Challenges:** Threshold concepts can be difficult to define precisely; assessment may be more qualitative than quantitative.

## Assessment Methods in Practice

### Formative Assessment in the History Classroom

Formative assessment—or assessment for learning—remains the most powerful tool for improving pupil outcomes. In history, effective formative assessment practices include:

**Low-Stakes Retrieval Practice:** Regular, brief activities that help pupils recall and consolidate substantive knowledge. This might include quick quizzes, "do now" activities at lesson starts, or cumulative questioning that draws on knowledge from previous topics.

** hinge Questions:** Carefully designed questions that reveal whether pupils have understood a key concept, asked at critical moments in lessons. Wrong answers trigger immediate intervention.

**Diagnostic Tasks:** Activities specifically designed to reveal pupils' thinking—such as asking pupils to rank causes of an event or evaluate a historical interpretation. The emphasis is on making thinking visible rather than generating marks.

**Live Marking and Feedback:** Circulating during written tasks to provide immediate verbal feedback, address misconceptions, and guide thinking in real-time.

**Peer and Self-Assessment:** Teaching pupils to evaluate their own and others' historical thinking, using clear success criteria tied to disciplinary concepts.

### Summative Assessment Approaches

While the Commission advised against excessive summative assessment, schools still need to make periodic judgements about pupil attainment. Common approaches in history include:

**End-of-Topic Assessments:** Extended writing tasks that require pupils to draw on substantive knowledge and apply disciplinary concepts. These might include essays, source-based questions, or historical enquiries.

**Standardised Assessments:** Some schools use commercially produced assessments or share assessments within academy trusts to ensure consistency across classes and schools.

**Portfolio Assessment:** Collecting a range of pupil work over time to build a picture of developing understanding. This might include extended writing, source analyses, and project work.

**Common Assessment Tasks:** Departments designing shared assessment tasks that all pupils complete, allowing for moderation and standardisation.

### Recording and Tracking Progress

The Commission warned against excessive tracking systems that generate workload without improving learning. Effective recording systems in history typically:

- Focus on the curriculum content pupils have covered and understood
- Identify specific gaps in knowledge or skills rather than giving overall grades
- Use manageable, periodic sampling rather than assessing every piece of work
- Are designed to support teaching decisions rather than satisfy external accountability

Many departments have moved away from complex tracking spreadsheets toward simpler approaches: knowing the curriculum, knowing the pupils, and making professional judgements about whether pupils are keeping pace with age-related expectations.

## Assessment Across Key Stages

### Key Stage 1

At Key Stage 1, assessment in history should be primarily observational and formative. Teachers assess through:

- Listening to pupils discuss historical topics
- Observing pupils working with sources and artefacts
- Reviewing recorded work and verbal explanations
- Noting pupils' developing use of historical vocabulary

The National Curriculum requires pupils to develop awareness of the past, use common words and phrases relating to the passing of time, and understand some of the ways we find out about the past. Assessment should focus on these foundational understandings through everyday classroom interaction rather than formal testing.

### Key Stage 2

Key Stage 2 builds more systematic historical understanding. Assessment should continue to emphasise formative approaches while beginning to track developing competence in:

- Knowledge of British history chronology and major civilisations
- Understanding of substantive concepts (empire, democracy, invasion)
- Development of disciplinary thinking (evaluating sources, constructing arguments)

Many schools use end-of-topic assessments that require pupils to write about historical topics, drawing on their knowledge and applying historical concepts. These assessments should be designed to reveal understanding rather than generate grades, with teachers using the insights to address gaps and plan next steps.

### Key Stage 3

Key Stage 3 is critical for developing the disciplinary understanding that underpins GCSE success. Assessment should focus on:

- Developing sophisticated understanding of second-order concepts (causation, significance, change and continuity)
- Building coherent historical narratives across time periods
- Developing source evaluation and interpretation analysis
- Writing increasingly complex historical arguments

Many departments use a combination of regular low-stakes retrieval practice (to secure substantive knowledge) and periodic extended writing assessments (to assess disciplinary understanding). Assessment without levels allows departments to design assessments that reflect the specific curriculum being taught, rather than conforming to external level descriptors.

### Key Stage 4

At GCSE, assessment becomes more standardised through the examination system. However, internal assessment remains important for:

- Tracking progress toward GCSE standards
- Identifying gaps in knowledge or skills that need addressing
- Developing examination technique

Formative assessment at Key Stage 4 should focus on the specific skills and knowledge required by the GCSE specification, using past questions and mark schemes to help pupils understand expectations.

## Challenges and Tensions

### The Accountability Context

Despite the Commission's recommendations, schools remain under pressure to demonstrate progress to inspectors and school leaders. This creates tensions:

- **Data demands vs. learning focus:** Senior leaders often want numerical data and progress measures that may not reflect the complexity of historical understanding.

- **Comparability vs. curriculum coherence:** Schools feel pressure to use systems that allow comparison with other schools, even when these don't align well with their curriculum.

- **Workload vs. thoroughness:** Teachers are caught between the desire to assess thoroughly and the need to manage workload sustainably.

### Defining Progress

Progress in history is conceptually complex and not easily captured by simple metrics. Key challenges include:

- **Non-linear development:** Pupils may appear to "regress" when encountering more challenging content or concepts, even as their overall understanding deepens.

- **Context-dependence:** Performance varies significantly depending on the specific topic—pupils may write brilliantly about a familiar period but struggle with unfamiliar content.

- **Different dimensions:** A pupil might have excellent substantive knowledge but weaker disciplinary skills, or vice versa. Aggregating these into a single judgement is problematic.

### Moderation and Consistency

Ensuring consistency of assessment within and across schools remains challenging:

- Without national standards, schools must develop their own approaches to moderation
- Professional development is essential to help teachers make consistent judgements
- Cross-school moderation can help, but is time-consuming to organise

## Emerging Best Practice

### Curriculum-Focused Assessment

The most effective assessment systems are tightly aligned to the specific curriculum being taught. Rather than assessing against generic descriptors, teachers assess whether pupils have learned the specific content and concepts in their curriculum.

This approach, championed by organisations including the Historical Association and researchers like Christine Counsell, emphasises that assessment should be designed backwards from curriculum content rather than forwards from assessment criteria.

### Assessment Literacy

Effective assessment requires teachers to understand both the subject and assessment principles. Best practice includes:

- Regular professional development on historical assessment
- Shared analysis of pupil work within departments
- Engagement with subject-specific research and guidance
- Development of assessment materials that reveal pupil thinking

### Pupil Involvement

Assessment without levels creates opportunities for more meaningful involvement of pupils in their own assessment:

- Clear explanations of what is being learned and why
- Transparent success criteria tied to curriculum content
- Regular opportunities for pupils to reflect on their own understanding
- Focus on specific next steps rather than generic grades

## Conclusion

Assessment without levels represents both a challenge and an opportunity for history teachers. Freed from the constraints of national level descriptors, departments can develop assessment approaches that genuinely reflect the nature of historical understanding and support rich, enquiry-based learning.

The key principles remain constant: assessment should serve learning, focus on the curriculum being taught, avoid unnecessary workload, and provide meaningful information to pupils, parents, and teachers. While the accountability context continues to create pressures, schools that have embraced curriculum-focused assessment report more meaningful engagement with pupil progress and reduced assessment burden.

As the education system continues to evolve, with increasing emphasis on curriculum coherence and evidence-informed practice, assessment in history is likely to become increasingly sophisticated in its understanding of how pupils develop as historical thinkers. The goal is not to recreate levels by another name, but to develop assessment cultures that genuinely support pupils in becoming knowledgeable, critical, and engaged students of the past.
