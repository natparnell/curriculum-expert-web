# Working with Sources in History Education

## Overview

Working with sources lies at the heart of historical enquiry and represents one of the defining characteristics of history as a discipline. Sources are traces of the human past—materials from or around the time of the period under study that enable pupils to construct knowledge about what came before. Without historical sources, there is no history, only speculation. Teaching pupils to work with sources effectively develops their disciplinary understanding while enabling them to participate in the authentic practices of historians.

Ofsted's history subject report *Rich Encounters with the Past* (July 2023) identifies source work as a particular area requiring attention. While many schools include source-based activities, inspectors found that these often focus narrowly on archaeological evidence or artefacts, leading to misconceptions such as conflating historians with archaeologists. Effective source work requires a broader conceptualisation and careful pedagogical planning to ensure progression in pupils' analytical capabilities.

## Types of Historical Sources

### Primary Sources

Primary sources are contemporary materials created during or around the time of the period being studied. These provide direct evidence about the past and come in numerous forms that teachers can deploy across the curriculum.

**Written sources** include diaries, letters, census returns, trade directories, newspapers, government records, legislation, telegrams, postcards, and official correspondence. These are particularly valuable for accessing the voices and perspectives of people from the past, though literacy demands require careful selection and scaffolding for younger pupils.

**Visual sources** encompass maps, plans, paintings, photographs, advertisements, posters, and moving film. Visual materials can be especially accessible to younger learners and those with lower literacy levels, though pupils need explicit teaching to read such sources critically rather than simply describing what they see.

**Physical sources and artefacts** include buildings, statues, everyday household objects, clothing, historical sites, and archaeological remains. These tangible connections to the past can powerfully engage pupils' curiosity, though teachers should avoid presenting them as unmediated windows into the past.

**Oral sources** comprise recorded interviews, speeches, radio programmes, music, and testimony. These can preserve voices often absent from written records, particularly those of working-class people, women, and minority communities.

### Secondary Sources

Secondary sources are created by people who were not present at the events being studied—typically modern historians writing about the past. While sometimes marginalised in source work focused on "primary" materials, secondary sources are essential for understanding how historical knowledge is constructed, contested, and revised over time. Working with secondary sources teaches pupils that history involves interpretation and debate rather than simply recovering facts.

## The Purpose of Source Work

### Developing Historical Understanding

Source work serves multiple interconnected purposes within history education. At its most fundamental, sources provide the evidential foundation for historical claims. Pupils learn that historical knowledge is not simply handed down but constructed from careful analysis of surviving traces of the past. This understanding of history as evidence-based enquiry distinguishes it from other subjects and develops pupils' critical thinking capabilities.

### Understanding Historical Method

Working with sources enables pupils to understand how historians operate. They learn that historians formulate questions, identify relevant sources, interrogate those sources for what they can and cannot reveal, corroborate findings across multiple sources, and construct arguments based on available evidence. This insight into disciplinary method helps pupils appreciate history as an active, ongoing process of enquiry rather than a fixed body of information.

### Recognising the Nature of Historical Knowledge

Source work teaches pupils that historical knowledge is provisional and shaped by the available evidence. They learn about the concept of "silences" in the record—what the sources cannot tell us because certain voices were not preserved, certain events not recorded, certain materials not surviving. This understanding develops intellectual humility and appreciation for the limitations of what we can know about the past.

## Progression in Working with Sources

### Early Years and Key Stage 1

In the Early Years Foundation Stage, children begin developing foundational concepts that support later source work. Through Understanding the World, children explore the immediate past of their own lives and families. They encounter simple distinctions between "now" and "then" and begin to recognise that photographs, objects, and stories can tell us about the past. Teachers should provide opportunities for children to handle age-appropriate artefacts, look at historical photographs, and listen to stories about the past.

In Key Stage 1, pupils develop their ability to ask and answer questions about the past using simple sources. They learn to look carefully at historical photographs and pictures, describing what they can see and beginning to make simple inferences. Handling objects from the past—whether genuine artefacts or good-quality reproductions—develops their understanding that people in the past lived differently. Pupils should encounter a range of source types beyond just photographs and artefacts, including simple written sources such as diary entries or letters read aloud by the teacher.

At this stage, questioning frameworks help structure pupils' engagement. Simple prompts such as "What can we see?" "What might this tell us?" and "What questions do we have?" develop habits of careful observation and curiosity. Teachers should model the language of uncertainty—"this might tell us," "the source suggests," "we could infer"—to develop pupils' understanding that sources require interpretation.

### Key Stage 2

In Key Stage 2, pupils' source analysis becomes more systematic and sophisticated. They learn to interrogate sources with greater rigour, considering not just what sources say or show but how they were created, by whom, and for what purpose. Pupils develop understanding that sources are not neutral windows into the past but products of particular perspectives and intentions.

By the end of Key Stage 2, pupils should be able to identify the origin and nature of different sources, recognise that sources may reflect the viewpoints of their creators, understand that sources vary in what they can reveal about the past, and begin evaluating the reliability and utility of sources for particular enquiries. They should encounter increasingly complex source types, including contradictory accounts of the same events, and learn that historians often work with incomplete or conflicting evidence.

Teachers should introduce structured frameworks for source analysis that scaffold pupils' thinking without becoming mechanical formulae. The Historical Association's enquiry toolkit suggests questions such as: What type of source is this? When was it produced? Who produced it? Why was it produced? Who was the intended audience? What does it tell us? What doesn't it tell us? How reliable is it for our enquiry?

### Key Stage 3

At Key Stage 3, pupils' source work develops significantly in sophistication. They engage with more complex source materials, including lengthy written documents, multiple conflicting accounts, and sources requiring contextual knowledge to interpret effectively. Pupils learn to evaluate sources in relation to specific historical questions, recognising that a source's utility depends on what the historian is trying to find out.

A crucial development at this stage is understanding that source evaluation involves more than simply labelling sources "reliable" or "unreliable." Pupils learn to consider the nature of a source's reliability—what aspects might be trustworthy and why, what limitations it has, and how it might be used alongside other sources to build historical understanding. They develop appreciation for the concept of "weight" of evidence and learn to assess the relative value of different sources for particular enquiries.

Pupils should also engage more explicitly with the process of historical argumentation using sources. This includes learning to select and deploy evidence to support claims, understanding the difference between evidence and assertion, and recognising that historical arguments require substantiation from the sources. The "evidence sandwich" approach—making a claim, providing supporting evidence from sources, and explaining how that evidence supports the claim—provides a useful structure for developing written arguments.

### Key Stage 4 and Beyond

At GCSE and beyond, source work becomes more specialised and demanding. Pupils engage with source-based questions in examination contexts, requiring them to analyse and evaluate sources under timed conditions. They develop more nuanced understanding of historical interpretation, learning that different historians may reach different conclusions from the same body of evidence due to different questions, methods, and theoretical frameworks.

Pupils at this level should understand concepts such as bias, subjectivity, propaganda, and perspective in more sophisticated ways. They learn to analyse how and why sources were created with greater precision, considering factors such as genre, convention, and context of production. They also develop skills in working with source collections—synthesising information across multiple sources to build comprehensive understanding of historical issues.

## Pedagogical Approaches for Source Work

### Enquiry-Based Learning

Sources are most powerful when deployed within historical enquiries rather than as isolated exercises. An enquiry approach frames source work around genuine historical questions, motivating pupils' engagement and giving purpose to their analysis. Teachers should design enquiries that require pupils to use sources to answer questions that are genuinely open and historically significant.

The enquiry process typically follows a sequence: establishing an overarching enquiry question; introducing relevant historical context; presenting sources for analysis; supporting pupils in interrogating and comparing sources; drawing conclusions based on the available evidence; and evaluating what has been learned about both the historical topic and the process of working with sources. This approach mirrors authentic historical practice while providing clear structure for teaching.

### The Evidence Sandwich

The evidence sandwich provides a pedagogical framework for helping pupils integrate source analysis with extended written argument. Many pupils can analyse sources effectively but struggle to use that analysis in structured writing. The evidence sandwich framework addresses this by teaching pupils to:

**Make a claim**—state an argument or point in response to the enquiry question.

**Provide evidence**—introduce specific information from relevant sources that supports the claim.

**Explain the connection**—explain how the evidence supports the claim, considering what the source reveals and any limitations or qualifications that should be acknowledged.

This three-part structure can be adapted for different age groups, with younger pupils using simpler versions and older pupils developing more sophisticated argumentation that weighs multiple sources and considers counter-evidence.

### Visual Sources and Visual Literacy

Visual sources require specific pedagogical approaches that develop pupils' visual literacy. Simply asking pupils to "look at" a source is insufficient—teachers need to structure careful observation and interpretation. Strategies include:

**Layered observation**—beginning with literal description ("I can see...") before moving to inference ("This suggests...") and finally to contextual interpretation ("This tells us about... because...").

**Multiple viewpoints**—considering what different people depicted in a source might be thinking or experiencing, or how different audiences might have interpreted it.

**Comparison exercises**—analysing multiple visual sources depicting the same event or theme to identify differences in perspective, emphasis, and message.

**Creator perspective**—exploring who created the visual source, why they created it, and what choices they made in composition, emphasis, and presentation.

### Handling Artefacts

Physical sources and artefacts provide unique opportunities for sensory engagement with the past. Effective artefact work involves:

**Careful handling**—teaching pupils to respect genuine artefacts while engaging closely with their physical properties—weight, texture, materials, wear patterns, construction techniques.

**Speculation and investigation**—encouraging pupils to generate hypotheses about objects before providing contextual information, developing their reasoning from evidence.

**Multiple interpretations**—exploring how the same object might be interpreted differently depending on the questions being asked and the contexts being considered.

**Connecting to broader contexts**—using artefacts as entry points to broader historical themes rather than treating them as isolated curiosities.

### Working with Difficult Sources

History teachers must sometimes work with sources that depict violence, injustice, or trauma. This requires sensitive pedagogy that:

**Provides appropriate context**—ensuring pupils understand the historical circumstances without being overwhelmed by graphic detail.

**Considers age-appropriateness**—selecting sources suitable for pupils' developmental stages while not sanitising the past inappropriately.

**Acknowledges emotional responses**—recognising that sources may provoke strong reactions and creating space for pupils to process these.

**Maintains historical focus**—while acknowledging ethical dimensions, keeping the focus on historical understanding rather than voyeurism or sensationalism.

## Common Challenges and Misconceptions

### The Reliability Trap

One common pitfall in source teaching is the "reliability trap"—pupils learning to evaluate sources by simply determining whether they are "reliable" or "unreliable." This binary approach oversimplifies the complex nature of historical evidence. More sophisticated source work teaches pupils to consider what aspects of a source might be trustworthy, in what ways it might be limited, and how it can be used alongside other sources to build understanding—even sources that are "biased" can be valuable evidence of perspectives and attitudes.

Teachers should model nuanced evaluation language: "This source is useful for showing X but less useful for Y because..." "The author's position as Z means we should be cautious about their account of..." "While this source is clearly promoting a particular view, it still provides evidence that..."

### Presentism and Anachronism

Pupils often approach sources through the lens of present-day values and assumptions, judging people in the past by contemporary standards or assuming that past societies operated like our own. Effective source teaching explicitly addresses this presentism by:

**Building contextual knowledge**—ensuring pupils understand the historical circumstances in which sources were created before analysing them.

**Highlighting difference**—explicitly drawing attention to ways in which past societies differed from our own.

**Developing historical empathy**—helping pupils understand how people in the past might have thought and felt, without necessarily endorsing their views.

**Using careful questioning**—avoiding questions that invite anachronistic judgment ("Was Henry VIII a good father?") in favour of questions that develop historical understanding ("How did Henry VIII's priorities as monarch affect his family relationships?").

### Conflating Primary and Secondary Sources

Pupils sometimes struggle to distinguish primary from secondary sources or misunderstand the relationship between them. Teachers should provide explicit teaching about the differences between sources created at the time and those created subsequently, while also helping pupils understand that both types are valuable and that secondary sources are themselves essential objects of study for understanding how historical interpretation develops.

### Source Overload

Presenting pupils with too many sources, or sources that are too complex, can overwhelm rather than develop understanding. Effective source selection involves:

**Quality over quantity**—a few well-chosen sources thoroughly analysed beats numerous sources superficially examined.

**Appropriate challenge**—sources should stretch pupils' capabilities without being impossibly difficult.

**Clear purpose**—every source included should serve a clear purpose in the enquiry.

**Manageable length**—excerpting longer sources appropriately so pupils can focus on relevant sections.

## Assessment of Source Skills

### What to Assess

Assessment of source work should focus on pupils' ability to:

**Extract information**—identify and record relevant details from sources.

**Make inferences**—draw reasonable conclusions beyond what is explicitly stated.

**Evaluate utility**—assess what a source can contribute to a particular enquiry.

**Evaluate reliability**—assess the trustworthiness of sources considering provenance, purpose, and context.

**Synthesise across sources**—combine information from multiple sources to build comprehensive understanding.

**Construct arguments**—use sources as evidence to support historical claims.

### Assessment Methods

**Written responses** to source-based questions remain common, but teachers should ensure these require genuine analysis rather than comprehension of source content alone.

**Classroom dialogue** provides rich opportunities for assessing understanding through questioning that probes pupils' thinking about sources.

**Collaborative analysis** of sources in small groups allows teachers to observe and assess pupils' developing capabilities.

**Creative responses** such as writing from a source's perspective or creating visual representations of source information can reveal understanding in different ways.

## Conclusion

Working with sources is fundamental to history education, developing pupils' disciplinary understanding while enabling them to engage with the authentic practices of historical enquiry. Effective source teaching moves beyond simple comprehension exercises to develop pupils' ability to interrogate sources critically, evaluate their value and limitations, and use them as evidence in historical argumentation.

Progression in source work requires careful planning across key stages, with increasing sophistication in the sources pupils encounter and the analytical demands placed upon them. Pedagogical approaches such as enquiry-based learning, the evidence sandwich, and structured frameworks for analysis support pupils' development while maintaining engagement with the curiosity and wonder that sources can inspire.

Teachers should remain alert to common challenges including the reliability trap, presentism, and source overload, designing instruction that addresses these while building pupils' capabilities. By treating sources not merely as illustrations or comprehension exercises but as the essential building blocks of historical knowledge, teachers enable pupils to participate in the ongoing dialogue with the past that defines the discipline of history.
