# Historical Enquiry

Historical enquiry is the pedagogical approach that structures teaching and learning in history around carefully framed questions that drive pupils' investigation of the past. It represents one of the most significant developments in history education over the past two decades, transforming how teachers plan curricula and how pupils encounter historical knowledge.

## The Nature of Historical Enquiry

### Definition and Purpose

Historical enquiry is an approach to curriculum planning and classroom teaching that organises learning around questions that require pupils to engage with historical sources, construct arguments, and develop understanding through investigation rather than mere transmission of information. The enquiry question serves as what Michael Riley, in his seminal 2000 article "Into the Key Stage 3 History Garden," described as a "planning device for teachers, enabling them to structure coherent sequences of lessons, building knowledge systematically within well-organised frameworks."

The Department for Education's 2013 National Curriculum for History makes explicit reference to enquiry, stating that pupils should "pursue historically valid enquiries including some they have framed themselves, and create relevant, structured and evidentially supported accounts in response." This statutory requirement has cemented enquiry as a central feature of quality history education across all key stages.

### Distinction from Generic "Inquiry Learning"

It is essential to distinguish historical enquiry from generic "inquiry-based learning" approaches found in other subjects. As the Historical Association has clarified following DfE communications, historical enquiry is not about pupils discovering knowledge for themselves through open-ended investigation. Rather, it is a carefully structured approach where teachers design sequences of lessons that build the substantive and disciplinary knowledge pupils need to answer a rigorous historical question.

The enquiry question is not primarily for pupils to answer independently but serves as the organising principle that gives coherence and purpose to the curriculum. Teachers select and sequence content, source materials, and activities to ensure pupils develop the knowledge required to construct sophisticated historical responses.

## Characteristics of Effective Enquiry Questions

### Rigour and Historical Authenticity

Effective enquiry questions reflect the kinds of questions that historians actually ask about the past. They are not trivia questions with simple factual answers, nor are they generic prompts that could apply to any historical period. Instead, they engage pupils with genuine historical debates, issues of interpretation, and the construction of historical knowledge.

Michael Riley proposed several criteria for effective enquiry questions in his original formulation:

- **They are structured around historical Second Order Concepts** such as causation, change and continuity, similarity and difference, significance, and interpretation
- **They require pupils to engage with historical evidence** rather than simply recalling information
- **They have no obvious or trivial answer** but require reasoned argument supported by evidence
- **They are accessible** to pupils at the appropriate key stage whilst remaining intellectually challenging
- **They build progressively** across the curriculum, with later enquiries drawing on and extending earlier learning

### Examples of Well-Framed Enquiry Questions

The Historical Association and Teaching History journal have published numerous examples of effective enquiry questions across different key stages:

**Key Stage 1:**
- "How do we know about the Great Fire of London?"
- "Why do we remember Florence Nightingale?"
- "Were castles always safe places?"

**Key Stage 2:**
- "How did the Romans change Britain—and what stayed the same?"
- "Why was the Islamic Golden Age significant?"
- "What was the most significant consequence of the Norman Conquest?"

**Key Stage 3:**
- "How far did the Industrial Revolution change Britain?"
- "Why do historians differ in their interpretations of the British Empire?"
- "Was the First World War inevitable?"

In each case, the question requires pupils to engage with historical evidence, construct arguments, and demonstrate understanding of disciplinary concepts.

## Structuring an Historical Enquiry

### The Anatomy of Enquiry

Abdul Mohamud and Robin Whitburn, in their influential Teaching History article "Anatomy of Enquiry," deconstructed the essential elements of any historical enquiry within the school curriculum. Drawing on multiple examples from practice, they identified key components that characterise effective enquiry planning:

**1. The Enquiry Question**
The overarching question that provides coherence and purpose to the sequence of lessons. It should be shared with pupils at the outset so they understand the destination of their learning journey.

**2. The Enquiry Context**
The broader historical context that pupils need to understand before they can engage meaningfully with the enquiry question. This includes chronological positioning, key vocabulary, and foundational substantive knowledge.

**3. The Enquiry Process**
The carefully planned sequence of lessons through which pupils build the knowledge and understanding necessary to answer the enquiry question. Each lesson contributes distinct elements to the overall argument.

**4. The Enquiry Outcome**
The final activity or assessment through which pupils demonstrate their response to the enquiry question, drawing together learning from across the sequence.

### Lesson Sequencing Within Enquiries

Within an enquiry, individual lessons are structured to build progressively towards the overarching question. The Ofsted Research Review Series: History (2021) emphasises that "pupils make progress in history through building their knowledge of the past, and of how historians study the past and construct accounts." Effective enquiry planning reflects this by ensuring each lesson adds new layers of understanding.

A typical enquiry sequence might include:

- **Orientation lessons** that establish historical context and introduce key vocabulary
- **Investigation lessons** where pupils engage with sources and evidence
- **Synthesis lessons** where pupils compare interpretations and develop arguments
- **Resolution lessons** where pupils construct their response to the enquiry question

The Historical Association notes that the enquiry question "enables teachers to structure coherent sequences of lessons, building knowledge systematically within well-organised frameworks."

## Enquiry Across the Key Stages

### Key Stage 1

At Key Stage 1, enquiry is introduced at the lesson level by prompting pupils to ask and answer questions about the history they encounter. The National Curriculum requires pupils to develop "awareness of the past" and understand "how we find out about the past."

Effective KS1 enquiries focus on:
- Simple questions that can be investigated using age-appropriate sources
- Developing pupils' understanding of chronology and change over time
- Introducing the concept that we learn about the past from different types of evidence
- Building vocabulary and substantive knowledge through stories and narratives

The Oak National Academy history curriculum structures KS1 enquiries around "guiding enquiry questions" that are focused and accessible, whilst still requiring pupils to engage with historical thinking.

### Key Stage 2

At Key Stage 2, enquiries become more sophisticated, reflecting pupils' developing cognitive abilities and expanding historical knowledge. The National Curriculum specifies more detailed content requirements, and enquiries must balance substantive knowledge coverage with disciplinary development.

Effective KS2 enquiries:
- Span multiple lessons and develop more complex arguments
- Require pupils to work with a range of source types
- Engage pupils with questions of causation, change, and significance
- Build connections between different periods and places studied

Keystage History, in their guidance for primary teachers, emphasises that "our enquiry-led approach, structured around a limited number of expertly-chosen key questions enables you to blend substantive and disciplinary knowledge."

### Key Stage 3

Key Stage 3 represents the fullest expression of the enquiry approach, with Riley's original formulation specifically designed for this phase. The curriculum provides significant freedom for schools to design their own enquiries, and the Historical Association has published extensive guidance and examples.

Effective KS3 enquiries:
- Engage pupils with genuine historical debates and historiographical disagreements
- Require sophisticated use of evidence and construction of extended arguments
- Build systematically on prior learning from Key Stages 1 and 2
- Prepare pupils for the demands of GCSE history

Ofsted's 2023 subject report "Rich Encounters with the Past" found that in successful departments, "leaders carefully plan overarching enquiry questions for topics—these foreground an aspect of disciplinary knowledge, such as how historians use sources. Leaders explicitly plan how pupils learn more, and more complex, disciplinary knowledge."

## Enquiry and the Second Order Concepts

### Integration of Disciplinary Knowledge

A defining feature of effective historical enquiry is its integration of substantive knowledge (the content of the past) with disciplinary knowledge (how historians study and construct accounts of the past). The enquiry question provides the mechanism for this integration by requiring pupils to use disciplinary concepts to engage with substantive content.

The Ofsted Research Review Series identifies five Second Order Concepts that structure historical thinking:

1. **Change and Continuity** – Enquiries examine how and why things changed or stayed the same over time
2. **Cause and Consequence** – Enquiries investigate reasons for historical developments and their effects
3. **Similarity and Difference** – Enquiries compare societies, periods, or experiences
4. **Significance** – Enquiries evaluate why certain events, people, or developments matter
5. **Historical Interpretations** – Enquiries explore why historians differ in their accounts

Each enquiry question foregrounds one or more of these concepts, ensuring pupils develop disciplinary understanding alongside substantive knowledge.

### Progression in Disciplinary Understanding

Effective curriculum planning ensures progression in pupils' engagement with Second Order Concepts across key stages. An enquiry in Year 9 about similarity and difference across the British Empire should build upon and extend the analytical frameworks used in a Year 8 enquiry about the Mughal Empire.

The Historical Association's guidance emphasises that teachers should "plan for progression; ensuring, for example, that a Year 9 enquiry question about similarity and difference across the British Empire builds on and extends the analytical framework used to explore similarity and difference in a Year 8 enquiry about the Mughal Empire."

## Assessment Through Enquiry

### Formative Assessment

The enquiry structure provides natural opportunities for formative assessment. Each lesson within an enquiry sequence allows teachers to check pupils' understanding before proceeding to the next stage. The progressive nature of enquiry means that gaps in understanding will impede subsequent learning, making ongoing assessment essential.

Effective formative assessment in enquiry teaching includes:
- Checking understanding of key vocabulary and concepts
- Evaluating pupils' ability to work with sources
- Assessing the development of arguments across lessons
- Providing feedback that helps pupils improve their final enquiry response

### Summative Assessment

The enquiry outcome provides a natural point for summative assessment. Pupils' responses to the overarching enquiry question demonstrate their ability to draw together learning from across the sequence and construct a coherent historical argument.

The Ofsted Research Review Series notes that assessment in history should "consider the quality of curriculum design and its impact on pupils." Enquiry-based assessment enables this by requiring pupils to demonstrate both substantive knowledge and disciplinary understanding in an integrated response.

## Challenges and Considerations

### Coverage versus Depth

One of the central tensions in enquiry-based curriculum planning is balancing depth of investigation with breadth of coverage. Enquiries require time for pupils to engage deeply with questions, evidence, and argumentation, which can limit the number of topics that can be studied.

The Ofsted Research Review Series acknowledges this tension, noting that "constructing a high-quality curriculum is a significant challenge" requiring teachers to make difficult decisions about content selection. Schools must determine their own balance between depth and breadth, guided by the National Curriculum requirements and their pupils' needs.

### Teacher Knowledge and Development

Effective enquiry planning requires sophisticated subject knowledge. Teachers must understand the historical debates surrounding their enquiry questions, identify appropriate sources and interpretations, and anticipate pupils' misconceptions.

The Research Review Series highlights that "studies of history teacher development show the importance of a culture of challenging debate around content choice for the renewal of strong history curriculums." Schools seeking to develop enquiry-based curricula should invest in teacher professional development and create opportunities for collaborative planning.

### Pupil Readiness

Not all pupils arrive at an enquiry with the necessary prior knowledge to engage meaningfully. Effective enquiry planning includes careful consideration of what pupils need to know before they can address the enquiry question, and how this prerequisite knowledge will be established.

The Research Review Series emphasises that "teaching supports pupil progress by embedding frameworks of content and concepts that enable pupils to access future material." Enquiry planning must ensure these frameworks are in place before pupils are asked to engage with complex historical questions.

## The Future of Historical Enquiry

Since Michael Riley first invited teachers to "choose and plant" their enquiry questions in 2000, the approach has become firmly established in history education. The publication of the 2013 National Curriculum, with its explicit reference to enquiry, cemented its place in statutory requirements.

Looking forward, enquiry-based teaching in history continues to evolve. The work of the Historical Association, the journal Teaching History, and organisations such as Justice to History have expanded the range of exemplars and guidance available to teachers. Digital technologies offer new possibilities for pupils to engage with sources and construct responses. And ongoing research into history education continues to refine our understanding of how pupils learn historical thinking.

What remains constant is the central insight that enquiry represents: that history education is not merely about transmitting information about the past, but about bringing pupils "into a rich dialogue with the past and with the traditions of historical enquiry"—teaching them not just what we know about history, but how we know it, why it matters, and how they too can participate in the ongoing project of understanding the human story.
