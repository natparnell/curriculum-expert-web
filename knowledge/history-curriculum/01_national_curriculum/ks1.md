## 1. Introduction

Key Stage 1 (KS1) history marks pupils' formal entry into the National Curriculum for history. During Years 1 and 2 (ages 5–7), pupils develop foundational historical understanding that prepares them for the more demanding chronological and conceptual work of KS2.

The KS1 programme of study is deliberately constructed to:
- Build on pupils' emerging historical awareness from the EYFS "Past and Present" ELG
- Introduce pupils to the discipline of history through accessible, engaging content
- Develop core conceptual understandings (change, significance, similarity/difference)
- Establish foundational disciplinary knowledge (how we find out about the past)
- Prepare pupils for the chronologically secure knowledge required at KS2

As the Ofsted history research review (2021) notes, "In England, pupils begin their formal history education at key stage 1. What children learn in the early years foundation stage (EYFS) is crucial knowledge for them to build on in the future."

## 2. Statutory Attainment Expectations

The National Curriculum sets out a single attainment target for KS1 history:

> "By the end of each key stage, pupils are expected to know, apply and understand the matters, skills and processes specified in the relevant programme of study."

### 2.1 Pupil Outcomes by the End of KS1

Pupils should be able to:

| Domain | Expected Outcomes |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Temporal Awareness** | Develop an awareness of the past, using common words and phrases relating to the passing of time |
| **Chronological Understanding** | Know where the people and events they study fit within a chronological framework |
| **Comparison** | Identify similarities and differences between ways of life in different periods |
| **Historical Vocabulary** | Use a wide vocabulary of everyday historical terms |
| **Enquiry Skills** | Ask and answer questions, choosing and using parts of stories and other sources to show that they know and understand key features of events |
| **Disciplinary Understanding** | Understand some of the ways in which we find out about the past and identify different ways in which it is represented |

### 2.2 Critical Distinction: KS1 vs. KS2

Unlike KS2, which requires "chronologically secure knowledge and understanding," KS1 focuses on developing an **awareness** of the past. This reflects:

- Cognitive development constraints (limited time-span understanding)
- The need to build foundational concepts before demanding rigorous application
- The importance of engagement and curiosity in early history education

The National Curriculum explicitly notes: "In planning to ensure the progression described above through teaching about the people, events and changes outlined below, teachers are often introducing pupils to historical periods that they will study more fully at key stages 2 and 3."

---

## 3. Statutory Content Requirements

The National Curriculum mandates that pupils **must be taught about** four specified areas of content:

### 3.1 Changes Within Living Memory

**Statutory wording:**
> "changes within living memory – where appropriate, these should be used to reveal aspects of change in national life"

#### Key Characteristics

| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Focus** | Changes that have occurred during the lifetimes of pupils, their families, or known adults |
| **Pedagogical Purpose** | Develop understanding of change and continuity; establish foundations for historical comparison |
| **National Context** | Should, where appropriate, reveal aspects of change in national life (not just personal/family history) |

#### Typical Topics

- **Toys**: Comparing toys from today with those from parents' or grandparents' childhoods
- **Homes**: Changes in housing, heating, lighting, household objects
- **Schools**: Changes in schooling across generations (uniforms, classrooms, lessons)
- **Transport**: Evolution of transport from walking to cars, buses, trains
- **Communication**: Changes from letters to telephones to digital communication
- **Clothes**: Changes in fashion, materials, shopping for clothes
- **Shops and Shopping**: From local shops to supermarkets to online shopping
- **Technology**: The introduction and spread of household technologies

#### Teaching Approaches

The BBC Teach "Then and Now" series identifies six key themes: Clothes, Homes, Schools, Shops, Toys, and Transport—with Technology as a cross-cutting feature.

Best practice involves:
- Using artefacts and objects (old toys, household items)
- Oral history interviews with family members or older community members
- Photograph comparisons (then/now)
- Handling real objects from different periods
- Visiting local museums with handling collections

### 3.2 Events Beyond Living Memory

**Statutory wording:**
> "events beyond living memory that are significant nationally or globally [for example, the Great Fire of London, the first aeroplane flight or events commemorated through festivals or anniversaries]"

#### Key Characteristics

| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Focus** | Significant events outside pupils' direct experience or that of their families |
| **Significance Criterion** | Must be significant nationally or globally |
| **Pedagogical Purpose** | Develop understanding of events with wider significance; introduce pupils to nationally/globally significant narratives |

#### Non-Statutory Examples

The National Curriculum provides three non-statutory examples (schools may use these or select alternatives):

| Example | Significance | Teaching Notes |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **The Great Fire of London (1666)** | Transformative event in London's history; led to modern firefighting and urban planning | Most commonly taught topic at KS1; rich source material available; Samuel Pepys diary extracts accessible |
| **First Aeroplane Flight (Wright Brothers, 1903)** | Beginning of powered flight; transformative technology | Can connect to local aviation history; contrasts with modern air travel |
| **Events Commemorated Through Festivals or Anniversaries** | Includes Remembrance Day, Bonfire Night (Gunpowder Plot), Armistice Day, VE Day | Connects to national commemoration; supports British values teaching |

#### Alternative Common Topics

Schools frequently teach:
- **The Great Fire of London** (1666)
- **Gunpowder Plot / Bonfire Night** (1605)
- **Remembrance Day / World War I and II** (1918/1945)
- **First Moon Landing** (1969)
- **Titanic** (1912)
- **First Flight / Aviation History**
- **Introduction of Railways** (19th century)
- **Coronations and Jubilees**
- **Local significant events** with national resonance

#### Teaching Approaches

Effective teaching of events beyond living memory at KS1 typically involves:
- **Narrative approaches**: Telling the story engagingly and accurately
- **Sources and evidence**: Using maps, pictures, objects, and simplified documents
- **Drama and role-play**: Re-enacting key moments (safely and historically grounded)
- **Local connection**: Where possible, linking national events to local impact

### 3.3 Significant Individuals

**Statutory wording:**
> "the lives of significant individuals in the past who have contributed to national and international achievements, some should be used to compare aspects of life in different periods [for example, Elizabeth I and Queen Victoria, Christopher Columbus and Neil Armstrong, William Caxton and Tim Berners-Lee, Pieter Bruegel the Elder and LS Lowry, Rosa Parks and Emily Davison, Mary Seacole and/or Florence Nightingale and Edith Cavell]"

#### Key Characteristics

| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Focus** | Lives of significant individuals |
| **Significance Criterion** | Must have contributed to national or international achievements |
| **Pedagogical Purpose** | Develop understanding of significance; enable comparison across periods; provide accessible entry points to historical periods |
| **Comparative Element** | Some individuals should be used to compare aspects of life in different periods |

#### Non-Statutory Example Pairings

The National Curriculum provides six non-statutory pairings:

| Pairing | Historical Focus | Comparative Possibilities |
|---------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Elizabeth I and Queen Victoria** | Two iconic British monarchs from different periods | Childhood, court life, transport, empire, fashion, technology |
| **Christopher Columbus and Neil Armstrong** | Exploration across different eras | Motivations for exploration, technology available, impact of discoveries, dangers faced |
| **William Caxton and Tim Berners-Lee** | Communication technology innovators | Methods of communication, speed of information, access to knowledge, impact on society |
| **Pieter Bruegel the Elder and LS Lowry** | Artists depicting everyday life | What their paintings show about ordinary people's lives, work, leisure, environment |
| **Rosa Parks and Emily Davison** | Campaigners for rights and equality | Methods of protest, causes fought for, outcomes, historical contexts |
| **Mary Seacole and/or Florence Nightingale and Edith Cavell** | Medical heroes across different conflicts | Nursing and medical care, wartime contexts, bravery and recognition |

#### Teaching Significant Individuals

Best practice considerations:

1. **Focus on achievements**: Emphasise what the individual accomplished and why it matters
2. **Contextual understanding**: Place individuals within their historical periods
3. **Diverse representation**: Include individuals from different backgrounds, genders, and ethnicities
4. **Critical awareness**: As pupils develop, introduce that historical figures can be viewed differently
5. **Comparison**: Use pairings to highlight change and continuity across periods

#### Additional Commonly Taught Individuals

Schools frequently include:
- **Amelia Earhart** (aviation pioneer)
- **Mary Anning** (palaeontologist)
- **Grace Darling** (lifeboat heroine)
- **Scott of the Antarctic** (explorer)
- **Isambard Kingdom Brunel** (engineer)
- **Walter Tull** (footballer and soldier)

- **Local historical figures**: Notable residents, local heroes, former pupils
- **Local events**: Historical events that occurred in the area
- **Changes in the locality**: How the local area has changed over time
- **Local industries**: Historic workplaces, industries, or economic activities
- **Local monuments and memorials**: War memorials, statues, historical markers

#### Teaching Approaches

- **Local walks**: Observing historical features in the built environment
- **Local archives**: Using photographs, maps, and documents from local record offices
- **Oral history**: Interviewing long-term residents
- **Museums and sites**: Visiting local historical sites and museums
- **Maps**: Comparing historical and modern maps of the area

## 4. Sequencing and Progression Expectations

### 4.1 Chronological Understanding at KS1

The National Curriculum establishes specific expectations for chronological understanding at KS1:

| Level | Expectation |
|-------|-------------|
| **Foundation** | Use common words and phrases relating to the passing of time |
| **Framework** | Know where people and events fit within a chronological framework |
| **Application** | Identify similarities and differences between ways of life in different periods |

### 4.2 Progression from EYFS to KS1

| EYFS Foundation | KS1 Development |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Talk about lives of people around them | Study significant individuals in depth |
| Know some similarities and differences between past and present | Identify similarities and differences between ways of life systematically |
| Understand past through stories and settings | Use stories and sources to understand key features of events |
| Use simple time vocabulary (before, after, now, then) | Use wide vocabulary of everyday historical terms |
| Begin to sequence personal events | Fit people and events within chronological frameworks |

### 4.3 Sequencing the Curriculum

Schools have freedom in how they sequence KS1 history content, but effective curricula typically consider:

**Approach 1: Chronological (Within Reason)**
- Start with living memory (most immediate)
- Move to events just beyond living memory
- Then study significant individuals from various periods

**Approach 2: Thematic**
- Organise by themes (e.g., transport, homes, communication)
- Include changes within living memory and events beyond living memory within themes

**Approach 3: Enquiry-Based**
- Frame each unit around a key question
- Sequence to build conceptual understanding progressively

### 4.4 Preparing for KS2

The KS1 curriculum intentionally "introduces pupils to historical periods that they will study more fully at key stages 2 and 3." Key preparation includes:

| KS1 Foundation | KS2 Development |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Awareness of the past | Chronologically secure knowledge |
| Simple chronological frameworks | Clear narratives within and across periods |
| Some understanding of sources | Understanding how knowledge is constructed from sources |
| Beginning to understand representation | Understanding interpretations and how they are constructed |

## 5. Examples of Good KS1 History

### 5.1 Characteristics of High-Quality KS1 History

Based on Ofsted subject inspections in outstanding primary schools (2020) and Historical Association guidance, high-quality KS1 history exhibits:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Clear Purpose** | Each lesson/unit has clear historical learning objectives |
| **Substantive Knowledge** | Pupils learn specific historical content (not just skills) |
| **Conceptual Understanding** | Teaching develops understanding of change, significance, similarity/difference |
| **Disciplinary Awareness** | Pupils begin to understand how we know about the past |
| **Engaging Content** | Topics chosen to engage young learners while meeting statutory requirements |
| **Appropriate Assessment** | Assessment focuses on historical knowledge and understanding |

### 5.2 The Great Fire of London: Exemplar Unit

The Great Fire of London is the most commonly taught KS1 history topic and exemplifies good practice:

**Why it works:**
- Clear narrative structure (beginning, middle, end)
- Rich source material (Pepys' diary, contemporary maps, paintings)
- Local and national significance
- Connects to London as a place many pupils know
- Enables discussion of change (rebuilding, fire safety)

**Typical enquiry questions:**
- What happened during the Great Fire of London?
- Why did the fire spread so quickly?
- How do we know about the Great Fire?
- What changed after the Great Fire?

**Assessment example:**
Pupils use Samuel Pepys' diary entry and a contemporary painting to explain what happened and why it matters.

### 5.3 Living Memory: Toys Then and Now

A well-designed "Toys" unit exemplifies effective teaching of changes within living memory:

**Structure:**
1. **Engagement**: Pupils bring in favourite toys; discuss similarities/differences
2. **Investigation**: Handle old toys; discuss materials, mechanisms, play patterns
3. **Interview**: Speak to grandparents or older people about toys they played with
4. **Comparison**: Systematically compare toys across periods
5. **Conclusion**: Explain what changed and what stayed the same

**Historical thinking developed:**
- Change and continuity
- Causation (why did toys change?)
- Evidence (how do we know about old toys?)
- Significance (which changes matter most?)

### 5.4 Significant Individuals: Comparative Study

Teaching Christopher Columbus and Neil Armstrong as a pairing exemplifies good practice:

**Focus:**
- What did each person achieve?
- Why was their achievement significant?
- What was similar/different about their explorations?
- How did technology change between their times?

**Teaching approach:**
- Narrative accounts of each explorer
- Comparison of motivations (why did they explore?)
- Comparison of technology (what enabled their journeys?)
- Comparison of impact (what changed because of their achievements?)

### 5.5 Local History: Making It Meaningful

Effective local history at KS1:

**Example 1: School History**
- Use old photographs of the school
- Compare classrooms, uniforms, playground equipment
- Interview former pupils or teachers
- Create a timeline of school history

**Example 2: Local Building Study**
- Study a local church, castle, or significant building
- Use photographs from different periods
- Visit the building to observe features
- Understand why it was built and how it was used

## 6. Disciplinary Knowledge at KS1

### 6.1 Understanding Sources

Pupils should "understand some of the ways in which we find out about the past." At KS1, this typically includes:

| Source Type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **Objects/Artefacts** | Old toys, household items, coins, clothes |
| **Photographs** | Family photos, historical photographs, then/now comparisons |
| **Stories** | Accounts of events, diaries (simplified), oral histories |
| **Buildings** | Historical buildings in the locality |
| **Written Records** | Simple documents, letters (where accessible) |

### 6.2 Understanding Representation

Pupils should "identify different ways in which it [the past] is represented." At KS1, this includes:

| Representation | Examples |
|----------------|----------|
| **Stories and narratives** | Books, oral histories, simplified accounts |
| **Pictures and photographs** | Paintings, drawings, photographs from different periods |
| **Objects and artefacts** | Museum collections, historical items, replicas |
| **Buildings and sites** | Historical buildings, monuments, local landmarks |
| **Costumes and re-enactment** | Dressing up, drama, role-play (used carefully) |

### 6.3 Key Vocabulary for KS1 History

Developing historical vocabulary is a statutory requirement. Key terms include:

**Time-related vocabulary:**
- Past, present, future
- Before, after, then, now
- Long ago, recently, a long time
- Old, new, oldest, newest
- Year, decade, century

**Historical concepts:**
- Change, stay the same
- Same, different
- Old, ancient
- Evidence, source
- Then, now

### 6.4 Avoiding Common Misconceptions

The Ofsted history research review (2021) and Historical Association guidance identify common pitfalls in KS1 history:

| Misconception | Better Practice |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Presentism** | Avoid judging the past by modern standards |
| **Anachronism** | Ensure activities don't impose modern concepts on the past |
| **Source labelling** | Avoid teaching that sources are simply 'reliable' or 'unreliable' |
| **Decontextualised comparisons** | Ensure comparisons are historically grounded |
| **Over-simplification** | Don't reduce complex historical figures to single attributes |

## 7. Assessment and Progression

### 7.1 Formative Assessment at KS1

Effective formative assessment in KS1 history focuses on:

| Focus Area | Assessment Approaches |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Knowledge recall** | Can pupils remember key facts about people, events, periods? |
| **Chronological understanding** | Can pupils sequence events? Use time vocabulary appropriately? |
| **Comparison** | Can pupils identify similarities and differences? |
| **Use of sources** | Can pupils extract information from simple sources? |
| **Historical thinking** | Can pupils explain why things changed? Why events happened? |

### 7.2 End-of-Unit Assessment Examples

**Example 1: Living Memory (Toys)**
- Show pupils photographs of toys from different periods
- Ask them to put them in chronological order
- Ask them to explain what changed and why

**Example 2: Significant Individual**
- Provide a simple source (e.g., picture, object, short text)
- Ask pupils what it tells them about the person
- Ask why the person was significant

**Example 3: Event Beyond Living Memory**
- Ask pupils to sequence key events
- Ask how we know about the event
- Ask what changed as a result
