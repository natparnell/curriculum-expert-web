# EYFS and Early Years Geography: Understanding the World

## Introduction

The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) framework sets the statutory standards for the learning, development and care of children from birth to five years old in England. Within this framework, geography finds its home within the **Understanding the World** area of learning, one of the seven statutory areas that must shape educational programmes in early years settings.

This document explores how geography is conceptualised within the EYFS, the progression from the Early Learning Goals (ELGs) to the National Curriculum at Key Stage 1, and the pedagogical approaches that support young children's developing geographical understanding. It addresses both the statutory requirements and the broader principles of early geographical education, drawing on research into how young children make sense of place, space, and their immediate environment.

## The EYFS Statutory Framework: Understanding the World

### The Legal Basis and Structure

The EYFS statutory framework, established under the Childcare Act 2006 and subsequently revised, requires all early years providers in England to meet standards that ensure children learn and develop well and are kept healthy and safe. The framework is organised around seven areas of learning:

1. Communication and Language
2. Physical Development
3. Personal, Social and Emotional Development
4. Literacy
5. Mathematics
6. **Understanding the World**
7. Expressive Arts and Design

Understanding the World encompasses children's developing knowledge and understanding of their environment, other people, and features of the natural and built world. It provides the foundation for later work in geography, history, science, and other subjects, though it is important to recognise that the EYFS does not separate learning into subject disciplines in the manner of the National Curriculum.

### The Early Learning Goals for Understanding the World

At the end of the Reception year, children are assessed against three Early Learning Goals within Understanding the World:

#### ELG: Past and Present

Children at the expected level of development will:
- Talk about the lives of the people around them and their roles in society
- Know some similarities and differences between things in the past and now, drawing on their experiences and what has been read in class
- Understand the past through settings, characters and events encountered in books read in class and storytelling

While primarily historical in nature, this ELG contains important geographical elements, particularly the understanding of people in different roles and contexts within society.

#### ELG: People, Culture and Communities

Children at the expected level of development will:
- Describe their immediate environment using knowledge from observation, discussion, stories, non-fiction texts and maps
- Know some similarities and differences between different religious and cultural communities in this country, drawing on their experiences and what has been read in class
- Know some similarities and differences between life in this country and life in other countries, drawing on knowledge from stories, non-fiction texts and (when appropriate) maps

This ELG contains the most explicitly geographical content, requiring children to describe their environment, use maps, and recognise similarities and differences between places. The reference to "stories, non-fiction texts and maps" establishes early foundations for geographical literacy.

#### ELG: The Natural World

Children at the expected level of development will:
- Explore the natural world around them, making observations and drawing pictures of animals and plants
- Know some similarities and differences between the natural world around them and contrasting environments, drawing on their experiences and what has been read in class
- Understand some important processes and changes in the natural world around them, including the seasons and changing states of matter

This ELG addresses physical geography foundations, including environmental observation, comparison of different environments, and understanding seasonal change—concepts that will be developed systematically at Key Stages 1 and 2.

## The Nature of Early Geographical Learning

### Characteristics of Young Children's Geographical Thinking

Research into young children's spatial and geographical cognition reveals several important characteristics that should inform early years practice:

**Egocentric to Geocentric Development**: Young children initially understand space from their own perspective, gradually developing the ability to conceptualise space from other viewpoints. This developmental trajectory means that early geography must start with the immediate, tangible, and personally experienced before moving to the abstract or distant.

**Concrete and Sensory Engagement**: Young children learn about their environment through direct sensory experience—touching, smelling, walking through, and manipulating their surroundings. Abstract representations such as maps have limited meaning until children have developed sufficient symbolic understanding.

**Emergent Mapping Capabilities**: Even very young children demonstrate proto-mapping behaviours, creating representations of routes and spaces through drawing, modelling, and enactment. These emergent maps are valuable precursors to conventional cartographic understanding.

**Place Attachment and Identity**: Young children develop strong emotional attachments to familiar places, which form the foundation for later geographical understanding. These attachments are not merely sentimental but cognitive, helping children build mental models of their environment.

### The Role of Play in Geographical Learning

Play provides the primary context for geographical learning in the early years. Through play, children:

- Explore spatial relationships and boundaries
- Create and navigate imaginary worlds
- Negotiate shared understandings of place
- Experiment with different roles and perspectives
- Develop vocabulary for describing location and movement

Small world play, construction, outdoor exploration, and role-play all offer rich opportunities for geographical learning that is integrated with broader developmental goals rather than treated as separate subject content.

## Progression from EYFS to Key Stage 1

### Continuity and Transition

The transition from EYFS to Key Stage 1 represents a significant shift in how geography is organised and taught:

| Aspect | EYFS | Key Stage 1 |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Organisation** | Understanding the World area | Discrete subject: Geography |
| **Focus** | Personal, immediate, experiential | Broader locational knowledge beyond immediate experience |
| **Assessment** | Early Learning Goals (holistic) | National Curriculum attainment targets |
| **Pedagogy** | Play-based, child-initiated | More structured, teacher-directed |
| **Resources** | Sensory, concrete materials | Introduction to maps, globes, atlases |

Effective transition requires that Key Stage 1 teachers recognise and build upon the foundations laid in the early years rather than treating Year 1 as a fresh start. This means:

- Beginning with the immediate environment before moving to distant places
- Using fieldwork approaches that maintain the hands-on, experiential quality of early years exploration
- Recognising that children enter Year 1 with varying levels of experience and understanding
- Valuing children's existing geographical knowledge, including that gained outside school

### Building on ELG Foundations

Each ELG in Understanding the World provides foundations for specific National Curriculum content:

**From ELG: People, Culture and Communities**
- The requirement to "describe their immediate environment" leads to KS1 locational knowledge: naming and locating the world's seven continents and five oceans
- The use of "maps" in the ELG prepares children for using aerial photographs and plan perspectives at KS1
- Understanding "similarities and differences between life in this country and life in other countries" develops into the KS1 requirement to understand geographical similarities and differences through studying the human and physical geography of a small area of the United Kingdom and a small area in a contrasting non-European country

**From ELG: The Natural World**
- "Exploring the natural world" develops into identifying seasonal and daily weather patterns in the United Kingdom
- Understanding "similarities and differences between the natural world around them and contrasting environments" leads to comparing the UK location with a non-European country
- Knowledge of "seasons" is extended at KS1 through systematic study of weather patterns and their relationship to place

## Pedagogical Approaches for Early Geography

### The Environment as the Third Teacher

Drawing on Reggio Emilia principles, the physical environment is recognised as a powerful educator in its own right. Early years settings that support geographical understanding provide:

- **Varied spaces** that offer different scales of exploration, from cosy corners to expansive outdoor areas
- **Natural elements** including plants, water, sand, and mud that invite investigation of physical processes
- **Flexible resources** that children can manipulate to create their own spaces and representations
- **Views of the outdoors** that connect interior and exterior spaces
- **Documentation** of children's explorations that makes their learning visible and supports reflection

### Outdoor Play and Learning

The outdoor environment is particularly significant for geographical learning, offering:

- **Large-scale spatial experiences** that cannot be replicated indoors, including running, climbing, and navigating complex terrain
- **Natural features** such as slopes, vegetation, and weather phenomena that support understanding of physical geography
- **Seasonal change** that provides concrete experiences of time, change, and cyclical patterns
- **Risk and challenge** that develop children's spatial awareness and ability to judge distances and capabilities

Effective outdoor provision for geographical learning includes both structured activities (such as guided walks, mapping exercises, and weather observation) and unstructured exploration that allows children to follow their own geographical interests.

### Story and Narrative

The ELGs explicitly reference stories and non-fiction texts as sources of geographical knowledge. Stories serve multiple functions in early geographical education:

- **Expanding experience** beyond the immediate environment to distant places and times
- **Developing vocabulary** for describing places, journeys, and spatial relationships
- **Building empathy** and understanding of different perspectives and ways of living
- **Providing narrative structures** that help children organise and remember geographical information

Books such as *We're Going on a Bear Hunt* (Rosen and Oxenbury), *The Snail and the Whale* (Donaldson and Scheffler), and *The Journey Home* (Hennessey and Jullien) offer rich starting points for geographical discussion and exploration.

### Emergent Mapping

Rather than introducing formal maps immediately, effective early years practice supports emergent mapping through:

- **Treasure hunts** and trails that develop route-following and landmark recognition
- **Model-making** using blocks, boxes, and natural materials to represent spaces
- **Drawing** from observation and memory to create representations of journeys and places
- **Verbal mapping** where children describe routes and locations using gesture and language
- **Simple plan views** that introduce the convention of looking down on a space

These experiences build the foundational understanding that maps are representations of space, preparing children for the more formal map work at Key Stage 1.

## Assessment in the Early Years

### The Early Learning Goals as Assessment Framework

At the end of Reception, teachers make statutory assessments against the ELGs, determining whether children are at the expected level of development. For geography-relevant learning, this involves:

- **Observation** of children in their play and exploration
- **Discussion** with children about their experiences and understanding
- **Documentation** of learning through photographs, recordings, and written notes
- **Review** of children's creations, including drawings, models, and maps

These assessments are holistic and do not separate geography from other aspects of Understanding the World or from broader developmental progress.

### Identifying Readiness for Key Stage 1

Teachers should consider the following indicators when assessing children's readiness for Key Stage 1 geography:

- Can the child talk about their immediate environment using appropriate vocabulary?
- Does the child show curiosity about places beyond their immediate experience?
- Can the child use simple maps or create representations of spaces?
- Does the child recognise similarities and differences between places?
- Can the child identify and talk about natural features and weather?
- Does the child understand that places can be represented at different scales?

Children who have not met the ELGs will require additional support and carefully structured experiences to develop the foundations needed for Key Stage 1.

## Common Challenges and Misconceptions

### The Pressure to Formalise Too Early

A persistent challenge in early years geography is the pressure to introduce formal subject content before children are developmentally ready. This manifests as:

- Introducing world maps and globes before children have developed sufficient understanding of their immediate environment
- Expecting children to read conventional maps before they have engaged with emergent mapping activities
- Teaching country names and capital cities as disconnected facts rather than building from meaningful contexts
- Separating geographical learning from play and exploration

Effective practice resists this pressure, recognising that the EYFS provides a distinct phase of education with its own valid approaches and goals.

### Underestimating Young Children's Capabilities

Conversely, some practitioners underestimate what young children can understand and achieve geographically, assuming that:

- Young children cannot engage with environmental issues or distant places
- Abstract concepts such as scale and perspective are beyond young children's grasp
- Only concrete, immediate experience is valid for early years geography

Research demonstrates that with appropriate support and context, young children can engage with complex geographical ideas, including environmental sustainability, cultural diversity, and the relationship between local and global scales.

### The Indoor Bias

Many early years settings offer limited outdoor provision or treat outdoor learning as secondary to indoor activities. This indoor bias restricts children's opportunities for large-scale spatial learning, natural exploration, and weather observation—experiences that are fundamental to geographical understanding.

Addressing this requires:
- Equal status for indoor and outdoor learning
- Appropriate clothing and policies that enable outdoor play in varied weather
- Staffing that supports outdoor exploration as a core activity, not merely a break from 'real' learning
- Resources that facilitate geographical investigation outdoors

## Integration with Other Areas of Learning

### Communication and Language

Geographical learning provides rich contexts for developing vocabulary and communication. Describing locations, explaining routes, discussing weather, and comparing places all require and develop linguistic capabilities. The specificity of geographical vocabulary—terms for direction, distance, landforms, and human features—supports precise communication.

### Mathematics

Spatial thinking connects directly to mathematical concepts, including:
- **Shape and space**: Understanding the properties of shapes supports recognition of built forms and landforms
- **Measurement**: Comparing distances, estimating sizes, and using non-standard measures
- **Position and direction**: Language of location (above, below, beside) and movement (forwards, backwards, turn)
- **Pattern**: Recognising repeating patterns in the environment and seasonal cycles

### Physical Development

Physical activity in varied environments supports:
- **Gross motor skills** through navigating different terrains
- **Fine motor skills** through mapping, model-making, and handling geographical tools
- **Body awareness** and spatial orientation
- **Risk assessment** and judgment of physical challenges

### Expressive Arts and Design

Creative expression provides multiple media for geographical representation:
- **Drawing and painting** to record places and journeys
- **Model-making** to create three-dimensional representations of spaces
- **Dance and movement** to enact journeys and explore spatial relationships
- **Music and sound** to evoke different environments and atmospheres

## Working with Families and Communities

### Recognising Home Geographies

Children enter early years settings with diverse geographical experiences from their home lives. Some children will have:
- Experience of rural environments, farming, or natural landscapes
- Knowledge of cities, public transport, and urban features
- Experience of travel to other countries or regions
- Understanding of different languages and cultural practices
- Awareness of environmental issues through family discussion
- Experience of mapping and navigation through digital devices

Effective practice recognises and values this diversity, using children's existing knowledge as starting points rather than assuming uniform starting points.

### Extending Learning Beyond the Setting

Partnership with families can extend geographical learning through:
- **Home learning activities** that encourage exploration of the local area
- **Documentation sharing** that enables families to see and discuss their children's geographical interests
- **Family visits** that bring diverse geographical experiences into the setting
- **Community resources** such as local parks, libraries, and heritage sites

## Conclusion

The EYFS provides essential foundations for children's geographical education, embedded within the broader area of Understanding the World. While the statutory framework does not treat geography as a discrete subject, the ELGs establish crucial foundations for later learning: the ability to describe and compare environments, to use maps and other representations, to observe and talk about the natural world, and to recognise the diversity of places and cultures.

Effective early years geography is characterised by:
- **Play-based, experiential learning** that respects young children's developmental needs
- **Strong outdoor provision** that offers large-scale, sensory exploration
- **Gradual progression** from immediate experience to more distant and abstract concepts
- **Integration** with other areas of learning rather than isolated subject teaching
- **Recognition of diversity** in children's home experiences and backgrounds
- **Preparation for transition** to the more formal subject structure of Key Stage 1

As children move from Reception into Year 1, teachers must build upon these foundations, recognising that the children who can describe their immediate environment, compare contrasting places, and create simple maps are already geographers, ready to develop their understanding in new and more systematic ways.
