## 1. Legal Basis

### 1.1 Education Act 2002

The statutory foundation for the National Curriculum in England is the **Education Act 2002** (c. 32), which establishes the legal framework within which maintained schools must operate.

#### Key Provisions

**Section 78: General Requirements in Relation to Curriculum**
- Establishes that the curriculum for a maintained school must be a **"balanced and broadly based curriculum"**
- Requires the curriculum to:
  - Promote the spiritual, moral, cultural, mental and physical development of pupils
  - Prepare pupils for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of later life
- Applies to all maintained schools in England, including maintained nursery schools

**Section 80: Basic Curriculum**
- Requires every maintained school in England to provide a **"basic curriculum"**
- The basic curriculum comprises:
  - Religious education (for all pupils)
  - The National Curriculum (for pupils of compulsory school age)
  - Sex education (secondary schools only, with parental right of withdrawal)

**Section 84-87: Key Stages and National Curriculum Orders**
- Section 84: Defines the **four key stages** in England
- Section 87: Empowers the Secretary of State to establish the National Curriculum by order

### 1.2 Secondary Legislation

The detailed content of the National Curriculum is set out in **statutory orders** made under the Education Act 2002:

- **The National Curriculum in England: History Programmes of Study** — published by the Department for Education (DfE), effective September 2014
- These orders specify the **attainment targets**, **programmes of study**, and **assessment arrangements**

### 1.3 Scope of Statutory Obligation

The statutory duty applies to:
- **Maintained schools** in England (community, foundation, voluntary controlled, voluntary aided)
- **Maintained nursery schools**
- **Academies and free schools** are not legally required to follow the National Curriculum, though most choose to do so as a matter of policy

## 2. Aims of the National Curriculum for History

The aims of the National Curriculum for history (shared across Key Stages 1–3) establish the purpose and scope of history education in English schools.

### 2.1 Purpose of Study

> "A high-quality history education will help pupils gain a coherent knowledge and understanding of Britain's past and that of the wider world. It should inspire pupils' curiosity to know more about the past. Teaching should equip pupils to ask perceptive questions, think critically, weigh evidence, sift arguments, and develop perspective and judgement. History helps pupils to understand the complexity of people's lives, the process of change, the diversity of societies and relationships between different groups, as well as their own identity and the challenges of their time."

### 2.2 The Six Aims

The National Curriculum for history aims to ensure that all pupils:

| Aim | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Aim 1: National Narrative** | Know and understand the history of these islands as a coherent, chronological narrative, from the earliest times to the present day: how people's lives have shaped this nation and how Britain has influenced and been influenced by the wider world |
| **Aim 2: World History** | Know and understand significant aspects of the history of the wider world: the nature of ancient civilisations; the expansion and dissolution of empires; characteristic features of past non-European societies; achievements and follies of mankind |
| **Aim 3: Abstract Terms** | Gain and deploy a historically grounded understanding of abstract terms such as 'empire', 'civilisation', 'parliament' and 'peasantry' |
| **Aim 4: Historical Concepts** | Understand historical concepts such as continuity and change, cause and consequence, similarity, difference and significance, and use them to make connections, draw contrasts, analyse trends, frame historically valid questions and create their own structured accounts, including written narratives and analyses |
| **Aim 5: Methods of Enquiry** | Understand the methods of historical enquiry, including how evidence is used rigorously to make historical claims, and discern how and why contrasting arguments and interpretations of the past have been constructed |
| **Aim 6: Historical Perspective** | Gain historical perspective by placing their growing knowledge into different contexts: understanding the connections between local, regional, national and international history; between cultural, economic, military, political, religious and social history; and between short- and long-term timescales |

### 2.3 Key Pedagogical Principles

The NC framework implicitly embeds several pedagogical principles:

- **Chronological understanding** is foundational
- **Second-order concepts** (change, cause, similarity/difference, significance) structure historical thinking
- **Evidence and interpretation** are central to disciplinary understanding
- **Scale** (local-regional-national-international) provides multiple contexts
- **Diversity** of societies and perspectives is essential

#### Past and Present ELG (Early Learning Goal)

The **Revised EYFS Framework (2021)** includes a specific Early Learning Goal entitled **"Past and Present"** within Understanding the World:

> **ELG: Past and Present**
> 
> Children at the expected level of development will:

> - Know some similarities and differences between things in the past and now, drawing on their experiences and what has been read in class;
> - Understand the past through settings, characters and events encountered in books read in class and storytelling.

## 4. Attainment Targets

### 4.2 Structure of the Attainment Target

Unlike earlier versions of the National Curriculum (pre-2014), the current framework does not specify **level descriptors** or **national curriculum levels**. Instead, schools are expected to develop their own assessment frameworks.

The single attainment target encompasses:

1. **Knowledge** — knowing and understanding historical content
2. **Application** — applying knowledge to answer questions and analyse evidence
3. **Understanding** — understanding historical concepts, methods, and interpretations

### 4.3 Historical Second-Order Concepts (Embedded in Attainment Target)

The attainment target is operationalised through engagement with **second-order concepts**:

|---------|-------------|
| **Continuity and Change** | Understanding how and why things changed or stayed the same over time |
| **Cause and Consequence** | Analysing reasons for historical developments and their effects |
| **Similarity and Difference** | Comparing societies, periods, or events |
