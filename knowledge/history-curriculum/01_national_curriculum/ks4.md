## 1. Introduction

Key Stage 4 (KS4) represents a significant shift from the compulsory National Curriculum studied at KS1–3 to **optional, examined qualifications** in history. GCSE History is regulated by **Ofqual** and offered by multiple **awarding organisations** (exam boards), each with distinct specifications while adhering to common statutory subject content.

### 1.1 Status of History at KS4

| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Compulsory?** | No — history is optional at KS4 |
| **Statutory Entitlement** | Pupils have a statutory entitlement to study at least one arts subject, one humanities subject, and one modern foreign language |
| **Take-up** | Approximately 40–45% of pupils nationally take GCSE History (varies significantly by school type and region) |
| **Regulator** | Ofqual sets subject-level conditions and requirements |
| **Subject Content** | Defined by DfE in 'History GCSE subject content' (DFE-00346-2014) |

### 1.2 The 2014 Reform

The current GCSE specifications (first teaching 2016, first assessment 2018) resulted from the **2014 curriculum reforms**:

- **Linear structure:** All exams taken at end of course (no modular assessment)
- **9–1 grading:** Replaced A*–G grades
- **No coursework/controlled assessment:** 100% examined
- **Increased content:** Greater breadth and depth required
- **More challenging:** Higher demand in assessment objectives

## 2. Statutory Subject Content Requirements

All GCSE History specifications must comply with the **DfE subject content** (April 2014). This defines what must be studied, while awarding organisations determine how it is structured and assessed.

### 2.1 Core Requirements

The subject content requires students to study:

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Three distinct eras** | Medieval (500–1500), Early Modern (1450–1750), and Modern (1700–present) |
| **Three geographical contexts** | British history AND at least one of European/World history |
| **Five study elements** | Period study; Thematic study; British depth study; Non-British depth study; Historic environment |
| **British history minimum** | At least 40% of assessed content must be British history |

### 2.2 The Five Study Elements

#### 1. Period Study
- Focus on **at least 50 years** of a nation's history
- Develops understanding of **change and continuity** over time
- Usually focused on **international/national developments**

#### 2. Thematic Study
- Tracing a **key development** across **a long period** (typically several centuries)
- Requires understanding of **change, continuity, and turning points**
- Focus on **British history**

#### 3. British Depth Study
- Focus on a **specific period** of British history (typically 20–50 years)
- Develops **detailed knowledge** of a concentrated period
- Includes study of **specific features, events, and individuals**

#### 4. Non-British Depth Study
- Focus on a **specific period** of non-British history
- Develops understanding of **different national contexts**
- Often focuses on **conflict, crisis, or significant change**

#### 5. Historic Environment
- Study of a **specific site, building, or feature** in its historical context
- Develops understanding of **how physical evidence informs historical understanding**
- Must be **linked to the British depth study**

### 2.3 Assessment Objectives (All Boards)

All GCSE History assessments measure against four **Assessment Objectives (AOs)**:

| AO | Description | Weighting |
|----|-------------|-----------|
| **AO1** | Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the key features and characteristics of the periods studied | 35% |
| **AO2** | Explain and analyse historical events and periods studied using second-order historical concepts | 35% |
| **AO3** | Analyse, evaluate and use sources (contemporary to the period) to make substantiated judgements | 15% |
| **AO4** | Analyse, evaluate and make substantiated judgements about interpretations | 15% |
