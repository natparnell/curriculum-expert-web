## Overview

Key Stage 3 covers Years 7, 8 and 9 (pupils aged 11–14). The National Curriculum for history at KS3 represents a significant expansion in scope, complexity and disciplinary demand compared to KS2.

The KS3 Programme of Study was established by the **DfE National Curriculum in England: History Programmes of Study (2013)** and remains statutory for maintained schools.

3. **Study of an aspect or site in local history dating from a period before 1066**

### Pre-1066 Consolidation Study

**Statutory requirement:** "the study of an aspect or theme in British history that consolidates and extends pupils' chronological knowledge from before 1066"

**Non-statutory examples:**

## Common School Approaches

### Three-Year KS3 (Years 7–9)

- 2–4 hours per fortnight
- Full coverage of statutory content
- Time for depth studies
- Strong foundation for GCSE

### Two-Year KS3 (Years 7–8)

- Approximately 50% of schools have moved to shortened KS3
- Year 9 begins GCSE content
- Risks: curriculum narrowing, compression of content
- Mitigation: focus on "generative knowledge", careful content selection

**Ofsted position:** No rule barring schools with two-year KS3 from 'outstanding', but inspectors evaluate curriculum ambition.

### Sequencing Models

**Chronological approach:**
- Year 7: Medieval + Local/pre-1066
- Year 8: Early Modern + 1745–1901
- Year 9: 1901–present + World history

**Thematic approach:** Organise by themes (Power, Migration, Conflict) drawing on multiple periods.
