# KS2 History Content Requirements

## Overview

Key Stage 2 (KS2) history, covering Years 3 to 6 (ages 7-11), forms a critical component of the National Curriculum for history in England. The statutory programmes of study, first published by the Department for Education (DfE) in September 2013 and remaining in force with minor amendments, establish the content that all local-authority-maintained schools must teach. Academies and free schools are not legally bound by the National Curriculum, though most choose to follow it as a benchmark for curriculum quality.

The KS2 history curriculum is designed to help pupils gain a coherent knowledge and understanding of Britain's past and that of the wider world. It should inspire pupils' curiosity to know more about the past, equip them to ask perceptive questions, think critically, weigh evidence, sift arguments, and develop perspective and judgement. History helps pupils to understand the complexity of people's lives, the process of change, the diversity of societies and relationships between different groups, as well as their own identity and the challenges of their time.

## Statutory Programmes of Study

### The Legal Framework

The statutory programmes of study for history at KS2 are set out in the National Curriculum document published by the DfE. Schools must follow these programmes unless there is good reason not to do so. The programmes of study specify the content that must be taught but do not prescribe how it should be taught, giving schools flexibility in their pedagogical approaches and curriculum organisation.

Schools are not required by law to teach the example content shown in square brackets in the statutory document, nor content indicated as being 'non-statutory'. This provides scope for schools to adapt the content to their local context and the needs of their pupils.

### Attainment Targets

By the end of KS2, pupils are expected to know, apply and understand the matters, skills and processes specified in the relevant programme of study. The curriculum is structured around two interrelated dimensions: subject content (the 'what' of history) and disciplinary knowledge (the 'how' of history, including historical enquiry, use of evidence, and understanding of historical interpretation).

## British History: The Core Sequence

The National Curriculum specifies four units of British history that must be taught during KS2, spanning from prehistoric times to the Norman Conquest in 1066.

### Changes in Britain from the Stone Age to the Iron Age

This unit represents the earliest period of British history studied at KS2 and introduces pupils to prehistory—the time before written records. The statutory requirements specify that pupils should be taught about:

- **Late Neolithic hunter-gatherers and early farmers**: Pupils learn about the transition from nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles to settled farming communities. This includes understanding the development of agriculture, domestication of animals, and the establishment of permanent settlements.

- **Bronze Age religion, technology and travel**: The curriculum covers the development of metalworking (bronze tools and weapons), the construction of monuments such as Stonehenge, and the emergence of trade networks. Pupils explore the religious and ceremonial significance of monuments and the technological advances of the period.

- **Iron Age hill forts and tribal kingdoms**: The unit concludes with the Iron Age, examining the development of tribal societies, the construction of hill forts, and the emergence of more complex social structures. Pupils learn about Celtic culture, the Druids, and the eventual contact with the Roman world.

**Pedagogical considerations**: Teaching prehistory presents unique challenges due to the absence of written sources. Teachers must rely heavily on archaeological evidence, including artefacts, sites, and scientific techniques such as radiocarbon dating. The Historical Association emphasises the importance of helping pupils understand how we know about prehistoric periods and the limitations of the evidence.

### The Roman Empire and Its Impact on Britain

This unit examines the Roman invasion and occupation of Britain, covering the period from Julius Caesar's expeditions in 55-54 BC to the end of Roman rule around AD 410. The statutory content includes:

- **Julius Caesar's attempted invasion and its historical significance**: Although Caesar's invasions were not permanently successful, they established contact between Britain and Rome and provided written accounts of Britain that survive to this day.

- **The Roman Empire by AD 42 and the power of its army**: Pupils learn about the extent of the Roman Empire, the organisation and effectiveness of the Roman military, and the factors that made Roman expansion possible.

- **The successful invasion by Claudius and conquest, including Hadrian's Wall**: The unit covers the Claudian invasion of AD 43, the gradual conquest of Britain, and the construction of frontier defences, particularly Hadrian's Wall.

- **British resistance**, including the stories of Boudicca and Caratacus: The curriculum includes study of indigenous resistance to Roman rule, using the revolt led by Boudicca as a key case study.

- **The 'Romanisation' of Britain**: This includes the impact of Roman culture, technology, and beliefs on British society, including the development of towns, roads, sanitation, and the introduction of Christianity.

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils often view the Roman period simplistically as 'civilised Romans' versus 'uncivilised Britons'. Effective teaching challenges this binary, exploring the complexities of cultural interaction, the diversity of British experiences under Roman rule, and the selective adoption of Roman ways.

### Britain's Settlement by Anglo-Saxons and Scots

Following the end of Roman rule, this unit covers the period from approximately AD 410 to the arrival of the Vikings. The statutory requirements include:

- **Roman withdrawal from Britain**: Pupils learn about the reasons for Roman withdrawal (pressure on frontiers elsewhere, internal political instability) and the consequences for Britain.

- **The Scots invasions from Ireland to north Britain (now Scotland)**: This includes the establishment of the kingdom of Dál Riata and the movement of peoples between Ireland and Britain.

- **Anglo-Saxon invasions, settlements and kingdoms**: The unit covers the arrival of Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, the establishment of kingdoms such as Wessex, Mercia, and Northumbria, and the development of Anglo-Saxon culture.

- **Places names and village life**: Pupils explore the evidence for settlement patterns, including place name evidence (e.g., -ham, -ton, -ford endings), archaeological remains, and early written sources such as Bede's *Ecclesiastical History*.

- **Anglo-Saxon art and culture**: This includes the study of artefacts such as the Sutton Hoo burial and the Lindisfarne Gospels, exploring the sophistication of Anglo-Saxon craftsmanship and the blending of pagan and Christian influences.

- **Christian conversion**: The curriculum covers the Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England, including the missions of Augustine and the spread of monastic culture.

**Pedagogical approaches**: Teaching this period effectively requires careful handling of limited and sometimes contradictory sources. Teachers should help pupils understand the distinction between written sources (such as Bede, written centuries after the events) and archaeological evidence.

### The Viking and Anglo-Saxon Struggle for the Kingdom of England

The final British history unit covers the period from the first Viking raids to the Norman Conquest, ending in 1066. The statutory content includes:

- **Viking raids and invasion**: Pupils learn about the reasons for Viking expansion, the nature of early raids, and the subsequent settlement of Vikings in Britain (the Danelaw).

- **Resistance by Alfred the Great and Athelstan**: The unit covers Anglo-Saxon resistance to Viking expansion, the achievement of Alfred the Great in preserving Wessex, and the reconquest and unification of England under his successors, culminating in Athelstan's establishment of a kingdom of all England.

- **Further Viking invasions and Danegeld**: The curriculum includes the renewed Viking attacks of the late 10th and early 11th centuries, the payment of tribute (Danegeld), and the ultimate Danish conquest under Cnut.

- **The Anglo-Saxon laws and justice**: Pupils explore the development of English law and governance during this period, including the compilation of law codes and the establishment of local administrative structures.

- **Edward the Confessor and his death in 1066**: The unit concludes with the reign of Edward the Confessor, his death without a clear heir, and the disputed succession that led to the Norman Conquest.

**Progression in understanding**: This unit provides opportunities for pupils to develop more sophisticated understanding of historical causation and the role of individuals in history. The succession crisis of 1066 offers a rich case study for exploring multiple perspectives and contested interpretations.

## Ancient Civilisations

In addition to British history, the National Curriculum requires the study of two ancient civilisations that provide broader chronological and geographical context.

### The Achievements of the Earliest Civilisations

Pupils must study an overview of where and when the first civilisations appeared, followed by a depth study of one of the following:

- **Ancient Sumer**: Located in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq), often considered the world's first civilisation, with developments in writing (cuneiform), cities, and complex social organisation.

- **The Indus Valley**: The civilisation of the Harappan culture in modern Pakistan and India, known for its sophisticated urban planning, drainage systems, and still-undeciphered writing system.

- **Ancient Egypt**: One of the most popular choices in English primary schools, covering the period from around 3100 BC to the Roman conquest. Pupils study pharaonic rule, pyramids, hieroglyphics, religious beliefs, and daily life.

- **The Shang Dynasty of Ancient China**: The earliest confirmed Chinese dynasty, covering developments in bronze casting, writing, and early Chinese civilisation.

**Comparative thinking**: Teachers are encouraged to help pupils make comparisons between the chosen civilisation and other developments happening in the world at the same time. This supports the development of chronological understanding and an appreciation of the diversity of human societies.

### Ancient Greece

All pupils must study Ancient Greece, including:

- **A study of Greek life and achievements**: This covers aspects such as democracy, philosophy, art, architecture, theatre, and the Olympic Games.

- **Their influence on the western world**: Pupils learn about the lasting legacy of Ancient Greece, including its impact on political thought, scientific enquiry, art, and literature.

- **The development of the city-states of Athens and Sparta**: The curriculum includes study of the different political and social systems of Athens (democratic, cultural) and Sparta (militaristic, oligarchic).

- **The Persian Wars and Peloponnesian War**: Key conflicts that shaped the Greek world and demonstrated the shifting alliances and power dynamics of the period.

**Teaching approaches**: Ancient Greece offers rich opportunities for exploring the nature of historical sources, including the contrast between material remains (pottery, buildings, artefacts) and literary sources (Herodotus, Thucydides, plays, philosophy). Teachers should help pupils understand the distinction between Athenian democracy and modern democratic systems.

## A Non-European Society

The National Curriculum requires the study of a non-European society that provides contrasts with British history. Schools must choose one of the following:

- **Early Islamic civilisation, including a study of Baghdad c. AD 900**: This option covers the Abbasid Caliphate, the House of Wisdom, advances in mathematics, astronomy, and medicine, and the vibrant multicultural society of medieval Baghdad.

- **Mayan civilisation c. AD 900**: The classical period of Mayan civilisation in Central America, covering achievements in mathematics (including the concept of zero), astronomy, writing, and monumental architecture.

- **Benin (West Africa) c. AD 900-1300**: The Kingdom of Benin (in modern Nigeria), covering its art (particularly the bronze plaques), political structure, trade relationships, and encounters with European explorers.

**Rationale for inclusion**: This requirement recognises the importance of providing pupils with perspectives beyond European history and challenging Eurocentric narratives. The Historical Association notes that careful sequencing is important to ensure pupils have sufficient chronological understanding to place these civilisations in meaningful context.

## A Study Beyond 1066

The National Curriculum requires one study of an aspect or theme in British history that extends pupils' chronological knowledge beyond 1066. The choice of topic is left to schools, with example content including:

- A depth study of a turning point in British history, such as the arrival of the railways, the Battle of Britain, or significant social changes
- A study of a significant individual or movement
- An investigation of change over time in an aspect of British life

According to the Historical Association's 2022 survey, World War II remains the most popular choice for this unit, though there is increasing interest in diversifying the curriculum to include topics such as migration, the development of democracy, and the British Empire.

## Pedagogical Approaches in KS2 History

### Developing Chronological Understanding

The National Curriculum emphasises the importance of chronological understanding as a foundational element of historical learning. At KS2, pupils should:

- Continue to develop a chronologically secure knowledge and understanding of British, local, and world history
- Establish clear narratives within and across the periods they study
- Note connections, contrasts, and trends over time
- Develop the appropriate use of historical terms

The Historical Association, drawing on the research of Lee and Shemilt (2004), identifies chronological understanding as one of history's most important disciplinary organising concepts. Effective teaching involves more than simply sequencing events; it requires developing pupils' understanding of the proportional relationships between periods, the distinction between duration and date, and the complex ways in which past, present, and future are conceptualised.

### Historical Enquiry and Disciplinary Knowledge

The KS2 curriculum requires pupils to:

- Regularly address and sometimes devise historically valid questions about change, cause, similarity and difference, and significance
- Construct informed responses that involve thoughtful selection and organisation of relevant historical information
- Understand how our knowledge of the past is constructed from a range of sources

These requirements reflect a disciplinary approach to history education, where pupils learn not only historical content but also how historians work. This includes:

- **Working with sources**: Learning to evaluate historical evidence, understand the concept of provenance, and recognise that sources may provide contradictory accounts
- **Understanding interpretation**: Recognising that historical accounts represent particular viewpoints and that historical interpretations change over time
- **Constructing arguments**: Using evidence to support claims and understanding the distinction between evidence and assertion

### Local History

While not a separate statutory unit, the National Curriculum requires that pupils be taught about a local history study. This can be integrated within the British history units or taught as a separate topic. Local history provides:

- Concrete connections to pupils' own environment and community
- Opportunities to work with local archives, museums, and heritage sites
- A bridge between the abstract study of national history and pupils' lived experience
- Opportunities for fieldwork and authentic historical investigation

## Assessment and Progression

### Formative Assessment

Effective history teaching at KS2 involves ongoing formative assessment to track pupils' developing understanding. The Historical Association recommends focusing on:

- **Substantive knowledge**: What pupils know about the periods studied (people, events, developments)
- **Disciplinary knowledge**: How well pupils can use historical methods (working with sources, constructing arguments)
- **Chronological understanding**: Pupils' grasp of the big picture of history and the relationships between periods

### Common Assessment Pitfalls

Ofsted's research and inspection experience have identified common weaknesses in history assessment, including:

- **Over-reliance on written outcomes**: History learning may not always be best demonstrated through extended writing, particularly for younger pupils
- **Confusing activity with learning**: Tasks that are engaging but do not develop historical understanding
- **Assessing generic skills**: Attempting to assess 'critical thinking' or 'enquiry skills' without reference to specific historical content
- **Poorly focused end-of-unit assessments**: Questions that do not assess the key learning of the unit

### Progression Across KS2

Progression in history is not simply a matter of knowing more; it involves developing more sophisticated understanding of historical concepts and methods. By the end of KS2, pupils should demonstrate:

- More secure chronological frameworks, including the ability to place the periods studied within broader narratives of British and world history
- More sophisticated engagement with historical sources, including awareness of questions about reliability and usefulness
- Growing independence in constructing historical arguments using evidence
- An increasingly nuanced understanding of historical concepts such as cause, change, and significance

## Common Challenges and Misconceptions

### Challenge: Limited Curriculum Time

History competes with other subjects for curriculum time, and in some schools, history provision may be limited. The Historical Association's surveys consistently show that time is the most commonly cited barrier to effective history teaching. Schools must ensure sufficient time is allocated to cover the statutory content in depth and to develop pupils' disciplinary understanding.

### Challenge: Teacher Subject Knowledge

Primary teachers are generalists, and few have specialist history knowledge. The breadth of the KS2 curriculum—from prehistory to the modern day, spanning multiple continents—presents significant challenges. High-quality curriculum resources, continuing professional development, and support from subject associations are essential.

### Misconception: Presentism

Pupils often judge past societies by modern values and standards—a tendency known as 'presentism'. Effective teaching helps pupils understand past societies on their own terms while recognising the applicability of universal human rights standards.

### Misconception: Simplistic Causation

Young learners often default to monocausal explanations or focus on individuals as the sole drivers of historical change. The curriculum's emphasis on 'causes' in the plural and on structural as well as individual factors is designed to develop more sophisticated causal reasoning.

## Curriculum Organisation and Sequencing

### Chronological vs. Thematic Approaches

Schools have flexibility in how they organise the curriculum. Two common approaches are:

- **Chronological sequencing**: Teaching units in chronological order to build pupils' understanding of the narrative of British and world history
- **Thematic organisation**: Grouping units by theme (e.g., 'invasions and migrations', 'power and democracy')

Research suggests that chronological organisation is generally more effective
