# Historical Argument and Accounts

This article explores the construction of historical narratives, the processes of selection and representation that shape accounts of the past, and the epistemological foundations that underpin historical argument in school history education.

## Introduction: The Nature of Historical Accounts

Historical accounts are not neutral reproductions of the past but constructed representations shaped by the questions historians ask, the sources they select, and the frameworks they employ. Understanding how narratives are built—and why different narratives of the same events can coexist—is fundamental to developing pupils' disciplinary thinking in history.

The Ofsted research review for history (July 2021) emphasises that pupils learn how accounts of the past arise and are constructed. They learn how historians and others build on, challenge, or refine the work of others, and how argument and debate are underpinned by shared principles of enquiry. This understanding insulates pupils from narrow or distorted views of the past by revealing the constructed nature of historical narratives.

### What is a Historical Account?

A historical account is any representation of the past—including textbooks, documentaries, museum displays, and historical fiction—that presents a narrative, explanation, or argument about past events. Unlike historical sources, which are surviving traces of the past, accounts are constructed by historians working with those sources.

Christine Counsell and her colleagues note that teachers deal with the tensions inherent in their role: they must communicate core narratives of the past while enabling pupils to engage critically with those narratives and the interpretative frameworks behind them. This dual responsibility requires explicit teaching about how accounts are constructed.

## How Narratives Are Built: The Process of Historical Construction

### From Evidence to Narrative

The construction of a historical account begins with a question. Historians do not simply gather facts and arrange them chronologically; they pose specific enquiries that shape what evidence they seek and how they interpret it. This process involves:

**Selection of Sources:** Historians must select from the vast surviving evidence of the past. No historian can examine every source related to a topic. The selection process is guided by the research question, practical constraints, and the historian's theoretical framework. What is excluded can be as significant as what is included.

**Evaluation and Corroboration:** Sources must be evaluated for their reliability, provenance, and typicality. Historians corroborate sources by comparing them against other evidence, assessing consistency and identifying contradictions. This process is not mechanical; it requires judgement about the relative weight of different pieces of evidence.

**Interpretation and Synthesis:** Evidence does not speak for itself. Historians interpret sources within contexts they construct from their wider reading. They synthesise disparate pieces of evidence into coherent narratives or arguments, making connections that the sources themselves do not explicitly state.

### The Role of Narrative in History

Narrative—the organisation of events into a coherent story with beginning, middle, and end—is central to historical writing. As Daniel Willingham has demonstrated, stories are "psychologically privileged," leading to more durable learning. Pupils find it satisfying when knowledge fits within a comprehensible narrative and unsatisfying when it does not.

However, the narrative form itself imposes constraints on historical representation:

**Emplotment:** Historians must decide how to plot events—whether as tragedy, comedy, romance, or satire, in Hayden White's formulation. This choice profoundly shapes how readers understand the significance of events.

**Temporality:** Narratives require decisions about chronology, pacing, and the relationship between simultaneous events happening in different locations. These decisions are not dictated by the past itself but by the historian's purposes.

**Causation:** Narratives embed causal claims—this led to that. The selection and weighting of causes is a matter of argument and interpretation, not simply the recovery of causal chains that exist independently in the past.

### Building Historical Arguments

Historical arguments go beyond narrative to make explicit claims supported by evidence and reasoning. The Schools History Project (SHP) has long emphasised the importance of pupils constructing historical arguments based on evidence, particularly through structured enquiry questions that require evaluative responses.

Effective historical arguments typically:

- Make claims that are debatable and defensible, not merely factual assertions
- Include reasoning that explains why the claim is justified
- Deploy evidence selected from sources to support the reasoning
- Consider counter-arguments and alternative interpretations
- Use qualifiers that acknowledge the provisional nature of historical knowledge

Teaching pupils to construct arguments requires explicit instruction in claim-making, evidence selection, and reasoning. Approaches such as the C3WP (College, Career, and Community Writers Program) framework can help pupils learn to develop claims that are "debatable and defensible," supported by evidence and qualified appropriately.

## Selection and Representation in Historical Accounts

### The Problem of Selection

Every historical account involves selection at multiple levels:

**Topic Selection:** Historians and curriculum designers choose which topics to study. These choices reflect contemporary concerns, available resources, and the perceived significance of different aspects of the past. The national curriculum for history in England requires certain topics (such as the development of Church, state, and society in medieval Britain) while leaving considerable freedom for schools to design their own programmes of study.

**Content Selection:** Within topics, specific content must be chosen. A study of the Norman Conquest might focus on military campaigns, the construction of castles, changes to the English language, or the Domination Book—each selection producing a different account of the period. Teachers make these decisions at three levels: topic choices, content choices, and decisions about emphasis within lessons.

**Source Selection:** Historians select which sources to cite and how to present them. Primary sources can be quoted at length or summarised; their context can be elaborated or minimised. These choices shape how readers interpret the evidence.

### Representation and Perspective

Selection is inseparable from representation—how the selected content is presented. Historical representation involves:

**Framing:** The interpretative framework within which events are presented. The same events can be framed as a story of progress, decline, conflict, or transformation depending on the historian's perspective.

**Voice:** Whose voices are included in the account? Traditional narratives often centred on political and military leaders. Contemporary historiography increasingly seeks to represent the experiences of marginalised groups—women, the poor, enslaved people, colonised populations—whose voices survive less abundantly in the historical record.

**Scale:** Accounts can focus on the grand narrative of nations and empires (macrohistory) or on the detailed study of individuals and communities (microhistory). Each scale reveals and obscures different aspects of the past.

### Multiperspectivity in History Education

The concept of multiperspectivity recognises that historical events can be understood differently depending on the standpoint of the observer. A conflict that appears as a battle for independence to one side may appear as rebellion or terrorism to the other.

School history textbooks often present limited perspectives, which can impede the teaching of history from multiple viewpoints. Research by van der Veen and others (2022) found that including multiple perspectives in history texts influences students' representations of historical events. When pupils encounter diverse perspectives, they develop more nuanced understanding of why interpretations differ.

However, teaching multiperspectivity requires care. Pupils need sufficient substantive knowledge to understand why different groups held different views. Without this knowledge, asking pupils to "come up with their own interpretations" can lead to superficial or ill-informed responses. The Ofsted subject report (2023) found this was a common weakness in schools visited—pupils were encouraged to make interpretative judgements without the knowledge required to do so effectively.

## The Epistemology of Historical Accounts

### Constructivism and Historical Knowledge

Historical epistemology examines how historical knowledge is constructed and validated. The constructivist position, dominant in history education since the 1970s, holds that historical accounts are constructed by historians working with evidence, not discovered or copied from the past.

This constructivism does not imply that "anything goes" or that all accounts are equally valid. Historical accounts are constrained by:

**Evidence:** Accounts must be consistent with the surviving evidence, or provide convincing explanations for why particular sources should be privileged or discounted.

**Methods:** Historians follow disciplinary conventions for handling evidence, constructing arguments, and acknowledging uncertainty. These conventions are themselves subject to debate and development, but they provide shared standards for evaluation.

**Peer Review:** Historical arguments are tested through publication, review by other historians, and response to criticism. Accounts that cannot withstand critical scrutiny are modified or abandoned.

### Objectivity, Bias, and the Historian's Position

The problem of objectivity has long occupied philosophers of history. Can historians produce objective accounts, or are all histories inevitably biased by the historian's position, values, and theoretical commitments?

Mary Fulbrook describes all historical explanations as "theory-drenched." Historians operate from within analytical frameworks that shape what questions they ask, what evidence they notice, and how they interpret it. This does not mean objectivity is impossible, but that it must be understood differently—not as the absence of perspective but as the product of rigorous methodological practice and critical self-awareness.

For school history, this has important implications:

- Pupils should understand that historical accounts reflect the questions, positions, and purposes of their authors
- The goal is not to identify and eliminate "bias" (a simplistic framing) but to understand how different perspectives produce different accounts
- Historical knowledge is provisional and subject to revision as new evidence emerges or new questions are asked

### The Progression of Pupils' Epistemological Understanding

Research by Wineburg, Lee, and others has traced how pupils' understanding of historical accounts develops:

**Naïve Realism:** Younger pupils often believe that historical accounts are direct copies of the past. They may see the goal of history as establishing "what really happened" and view differences between accounts as errors to be corrected.

**Radical Relativism:** Some pupils progress to a position where they believe all accounts are merely opinion, with no basis for evaluating which are better or worse. "It's just their point of view" becomes a dismissive response to any historical argument.

**Critically Evaluative Stance:** The sophisticated understanding recognises that accounts are constructed but can be evaluated against criteria of evidence, argumentation, and consistency with what is known about the context. Pupils come to see history as a field of reasoned debate rather than fixed facts or mere opinion.

Teaching should support progression toward this critically evaluative stance by providing opportunities for pupils to compare accounts, evaluate arguments, and understand the processes of historical construction.

## Disciplinary Concepts and Historical Accounts

### Interpretations as a Second-Order Concept

In England, the national curriculum and common practice identify several "second-order" or disciplinary concepts that shape historical thinking. The concept of historical interpretations (or accounts) is fundamental among these.

The CHATA (Concepts of History and Teaching Approaches) project found that pupils' understanding of interpretations develops through recognising:

- That accounts differ and that these differences can be explained
- That accounts are answers to specific questions posed by historians
- That accounts reflect the contexts in which they were produced
- That accounts can be evaluated against evidence and criteria of argumentation

The Schools History Project (SHP) framework similarly emphasises understanding "how and why historians construct different interpretations of the past."

### Related Disciplinary Concepts

Understanding accounts is closely connected to other disciplinary concepts:

**Sources and Evidence:** Accounts are built from sources, but sources become evidence only when deployed to answer specific questions. Teaching pupils how historians use sources to construct claims helps them understand how different accounts emerge from different selections and deployments of evidence.

**Cause and Consequence:** Causal claims are embedded in historical narratives. The weight given to different causes reflects the historian's interpretative framework and the narrative they are constructing.

**Change and Continuity:** Accounts must decide what counts as significant change and what as continuity. These decisions shape the overall shape of historical narratives.

**Historical Significance:** Accounts attribute significance to particular events, people, or developments. Understanding how and why different accounts attribute significance differently is part of understanding the constructed nature of historical knowledge.

## Pedagogical Approaches to Teaching Historical Accounts

### Making Construction Visible

Effective pedagogy makes the processes of historical construction visible to pupils. Strategies include:

**Comparing Accounts:** Presenting pupils with different accounts of the same events and asking them to identify and explain differences. This can range from comparing two textbook accounts to examining how interpretations have changed over time.

**Source to Account Activities:** Showing pupils the sources historians work with and asking them to construct their own accounts, then comparing their efforts with published histories. This reveals the decisions involved in moving from evidence to narrative.

**Deconstructing Narratives:** Taking a historical narrative and asking pupils to identify the sources it is based on, the selection decisions made, and the interpretative framework employed.

### Using Enquiry Questions

Enquiry-based approaches structure learning around questions that require pupils to engage with historical arguments. Well-designed enquiries:

- Pose questions that are genuinely open to different answers
- Provide sufficient substantive knowledge for pupils to make informed judgements
- Include sources that can be used as evidence for different positions
- Require pupils to construct and justify their own arguments

The Schools History Project has developed extensive materials for enquiry-based history teaching, and research consistently shows that this approach supports the development of disciplinary thinking.

### Teaching About Narrative

Given the psychological power of narrative, explicit teaching about narrative construction is valuable:

- Help pupils recognise how narratives select, arrange, and emplot events
- Discuss how the same events can be emplotted differently (as tragedy, comedy, etc.)
- Examine how narratives embed causal claims and attributions of significance
- Consider whose stories are told in different narratives and whose are omitted

### Addressing Misconceptions

Common misconceptions about historical accounts include:

**The "Bias" Myth:** Pupils often believe that historical accounts are either objective (unbiased) or subjective (biased), with the goal being to identify and eliminate bias. More sophisticated understanding recognises that all accounts are constructed from particular perspectives, and the goal is to evaluate arguments rather than eliminate perspective.

**The "Right Answer" Myth:** Pupils may believe that there is a single correct account of the past that historians are working toward discovering. Teaching should emphasise that different accounts can be equally valid responses to different questions or perspectives.

**The "All Opinions are Equal" Myth:** In reaction to learning that accounts are constructed, some pupils conclude that all accounts are merely opinion with no basis for evaluation. Teaching must maintain the distinction between construction and arbitrariness—accounts are constructed but can be evaluated against disciplinary criteria.

## Progression in Understanding Historical Accounts

### Key Stage 1 and 2

In primary history, pupils begin to develop awareness that stories about the past can differ. The focus is on:

- Recognising that different people may tell different stories about the past
- Understanding that we learn about the past from different sources
- Beginning to ask questions about why accounts might differ

The Ofsted subject report (2023) noted that primary teachers sometimes lack expertise in teaching how historians construct accounts. Professional development in this area is essential for improving provision.

### Key Stage 3

At Key Stage 3, pupils should develop more sophisticated understanding:

- Explaining why historians construct different interpretations of the same events
- Understanding how the questions historians ask shape the accounts they produce
- Evaluating historical claims against evidence and criteria of argumentation
- Recognising how the context of production shapes historical accounts

Explicit teaching of disciplinary concepts should be embedded within rich substantive content, enabling pupils to develop both knowledge of the past and understanding of how that knowledge is constructed.

### GCSE and A Level

At examination level, pupils engage with historical interpretations more explicitly:

- GCSE specifications require pupils to analyse and evaluate interpretations
- A Level history includes depth studies focused on historical interpretations
- Extended writing requires pupils to construct their own historical arguments

Teaching at these levels should build on foundations laid earlier, supporting pupils in developing the sophisticated disciplinary thinking required for advanced study.

## Assessment of Understanding

### What to Assess

Assessment of pupils' understanding of historical accounts should focus on:

- Their ability to explain why accounts differ
- Their capacity to evaluate claims against evidence
- Their understanding of how narratives are constructed
- Their ability to construct and justify their own historical arguments

### Assessment Methods

**Written Arguments:** Essay questions that require pupils to construct and justify historical claims, supported by evidence.

**Source Evaluation:** Tasks that ask pupils to assess the value of sources for particular enquiries and to explain how sources might be used to construct different accounts.

**Interpretation Analysis:** Questions that present pupils with historical interpretations and ask them to analyse and evaluate them.

**Dialogic Assessment:** Classroom discussion that probes pupils' understanding of how accounts are constructed and their capacity to engage with historical argument.

## Implications for Curriculum Design

### Content Selection

Curriculum designers must make principled decisions about content selection at all levels. The Ofsted research review notes that high-quality curricula require:

- A clear rationale for topic selection
- Careful decisions about content emphasis within topics
- Regular opportunities for teachers to discuss content selection and its purposes
- A balance between substantive and disciplinary content

### Developing Disciplinary Thinking Over Time

Understanding historical accounts develops over time through repeated encounters with disciplinary problems embedded in rich content. Curriculum design should:

- Plan for progression in disciplinary thinking across key stages
- Return to key disciplinary ideas (such as the constructed nature of accounts) in different contexts
- Build cumulative understanding of how historical knowledge is made

### Supporting Teachers

Teaching about historical accounts requires teachers to have:

- Strong subject knowledge of the topics they teach
- Understanding of historical epistemology and disciplinary concepts
- Pedagogical strategies for making construction visible to pupils

School leaders should ensure that history teachers have access to high-quality professional development, particularly in disciplinary aspects of history that may be less familiar than content knowledge.

## Conclusion

Understanding how historical accounts are constructed—through selection, representation, and argumentation—is fundamental to pupils' development as historical thinkers. This understanding insulates them from narrow or distorted views of the past by revealing the processes through which all accounts are made.

Teaching about historical accounts requires making the processes of construction visible, providing opportunities for pupils to engage with multiple perspectives, and supporting progression toward sophisticated epistemological understanding. It requires curriculum designers and teachers to make principled decisions about content selection and to develop pupils' disciplinary thinking over time.

The goal is not merely to teach pupils that accounts differ or that history is "interpretative," but to enable them to engage critically with historical arguments, evaluate claims against evidence, and participate in the disciplined discourse through which historical knowledge is constructed, tested, and refined.
