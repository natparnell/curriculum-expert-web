# Constructing Historical Claims: From Evidence to Argument

## Introduction

Constructing historical claims is the intellectual core of the discipline. Unlike subjects where knowledge is presented as settled fact, history demands that pupils understand how claims about the past are built from evidence, subjected to scrutiny, and formed into arguments. This process—from the initial encounter with sources to the final articulation of an argument—is what distinguishes historical thinking from mere recall of information.

The Ofsted Research Review (2021) emphasises that pupils must learn "how evidence for a claim can be constituted and the conditions under which valid claims can be made." This involves understanding not only what historians claim but *how* they construct those claims through a sophisticated interplay of evidential reasoning, disciplinary concepts, and rhetorical strategies.

## The Architecture of Historical Claims

### What Constitutes a Historical Claim?

A historical claim is an assertion about the past that is supported by evidence and reasoning. Claims in history take various forms:

**Claims of fact** establish what happened, when, where, and who was involved. These might seem straightforward, but even basic factual claims require evidential support. For example, asserting that "the Battle of Hastings took place in 1066" rests on a body of documentary and archaeological evidence that historians have evaluated and corroborated.

**Claims of cause** explain why events occurred or what factors contributed to particular outcomes. These are among the most common claims historians make, requiring sophisticated reasoning about necessary and sufficient conditions, multiple causation, and the relative weight of different factors.

**Claims of significance** evaluate the importance, consequences, or meaning of historical events, people, or developments. Christine Counsell's influential "5 Rs" framework for significance—remarkable, remembered, resonant, resulting in change, and revealing—provides criteria for constructing and evaluating such claims.

**Claims about historical interpretation** address how and why accounts of the past differ. These meta-level claims require pupils to understand that history is constructed and that historians may legitimately disagree based on different evidence, questions, or perspectives.

### The Evidential Foundation

All historical claims rest on evidence, but evidence in history is unlike evidence in science or mathematics. Historical evidence is fragmentary, often contradictory, and always mediated through human creation and preservation. As the Historical Association notes, "The historian's skill lies in identifying" appropriate sources and evaluating their evidential value.

The Ofsted review draws on Christine Counsell's work to distinguish between substantive knowledge (what we know about the past) and disciplinary knowledge (how we know it). Constructing claims belongs to the latter category—it is about understanding the conditions under which valid historical claims can be made.

## The Process of Constructing Claims

### From Sources to Evidence

The first stage in constructing historical claims involves transforming sources into usable evidence. This is not a mechanical process but one requiring active interpretation and evaluation.

**Sourcing** is the foundational heuristic identified by Sam Wineburg and the Stanford History Education Group. Before reading a document for content, historians interrogate its provenance: Who created this? When? For what purpose? Under what circumstances? This sourcing heuristic is crucial because it shapes how the historian evaluates the document's evidential value.

Wineburg's research demonstrates that expert historians automatically engage in sourcing, while novices tend to read documents for literal comprehension without considering their origins. Teaching pupils to source documents before reading them is therefore essential for developing their capacity to construct valid claims.

**Contextualisation** situates sources within their historical circumstances. Understanding the context in which a document was created—including political conditions, social norms, and contemporary events—enables historians to interpret its meaning appropriately. Without contextualisation, sources can be misread through the lens of present assumptions.

**Corroboration** involves comparing multiple sources to establish what is reliable and to identify points of agreement and disagreement. No single source provides a complete picture; valid claims typically require evidence drawn from multiple sources that corroborate each other. When sources conflict, historians must evaluate their relative reliability and explain the reasons for disagreement.

### From Evidence to Claims

Once sources have been evaluated as evidence, historians construct claims through several interrelated processes:

**Identifying patterns** in the evidence is essential for moving from particular facts to general claims. This involves recognising similarities across sources, noting trends over time, and identifying relationships between phenomena. Pattern recognition requires both attention to detail and the ability to see larger structures.

**Evaluating significance** determines which evidence matters most for the claim being constructed. Not all evidence carries equal weight; historians must make judgments about relevance, typicality, and evidential strength. A vivid but atypical source may be less valuable for constructing a claim than a more mundane but representative document.

**Formulating propositions** involves articulating tentative claims that can be tested against further evidence. These propositions are working hypotheses rather than final conclusions. They provide direction for further research and a basis for organising evidence.

**Substantiation** is the process of supporting claims with appropriate evidence and reasoning. A claim without substantiation is merely an assertion; valid historical claims require explicit connections between the claim and the evidence that supports it.

## The Role of Historical Reasoning

### Causal Reasoning

Causal claims are central to historical argument, requiring sophisticated reasoning about why events occurred. Several frameworks support the construction of causal claims:

**Necessary and sufficient conditions** help historians distinguish between factors that were essential for an outcome and those that merely contributed to it. A cause may be necessary (the outcome would not have occurred without it) without being sufficient (other factors were also required).

**Multiple causation** recognises that historical events typically result from the interaction of multiple factors rather than single causes. Constructing causal claims involves identifying the various contributing factors and explaining how they combined to produce the outcome.

**Intended and unintended consequences** distinguish between outcomes that actors sought and those that resulted from their actions without being planned. This distinction is crucial for evaluating historical agency and responsibility.

**Counterfactual reasoning**—considering what might have happened under different circumstances—can illuminate the significance of particular causes. By imagining alternative scenarios, historians can assess whether a factor was genuinely consequential or merely incidental.

### Colligation and Conceptual Organisation

**Colligation** is the process of organising events and evidence under appropriate concepts. As Peter Lee (1983) argued, "colligation under appropriate conceptions is more interesting, and its importance for history extends much wider, than the area of explanation."

Constructing claims often requires finding the appropriate conceptual framework for organising evidence. For example, describing a set of changes as "revolutionary" or "evolutionary" involves colligating diverse events under a conceptual category that shapes how the claim is understood.

Conceptual thinking in history requires pupils to work with substantive concepts—such as empire, democracy, or industrialisation—in ways that recognise their contested and evolving meanings. Claims that employ these concepts must be sensitive to their historical specificity and avoid anachronistic application.

## Argument Construction in Practice

### The Structure of Historical Argument

Historical arguments have distinctive features that pupils must learn to recognise and produce:

**Thesis statements** articulate the central claim that the argument will support. A strong historical thesis is specific, contestable, and capable of being supported by evidence. Vague or obvious theses produce weak arguments.

**Evidence selection** involves choosing the sources and information that best support the claim. This requires judgment about relevance, reliability, and representative value. Good historical argument uses evidence strategically rather than merely listing facts.

**Reasoning connections** explain how the evidence supports the claim. These connections make the argument's logic explicit, showing readers why the evidence should be taken as substantiation for the claim. Without such connections, evidence and claim remain disconnected.

**Addressing counter-evidence** strengthens historical arguments by acknowledging and responding to evidence that appears to contradict the claim. This demonstrates awareness of complexity and shows that the claim can withstand scrutiny.

**Concluding claims** synthesise the argument and articulate its significance. Strong conclusions do not merely restate the thesis but extend it, showing what follows from the argument and why it matters.

### Rhetorical Strategies

Historians employ various rhetorical strategies to construct persuasive arguments:

**Narrative structure** organises claims in chronological or thematic form. Narrative is not merely a literary device but a mode of explanation that shows how events developed and why outcomes occurred.

**Analytical structure** breaks down complex phenomena into component parts for systematic examination. This approach prioritises clarity and logical organisation over chronological flow.

**Comparative structure** develops claims through comparison and contrast. By examining similarities and differences between cases, historians can construct claims about patterns, causes, and significance that would be invisible from single-case analysis.

**Evidence-based reasoning** uses the Claim-Evidence-Reasoning (CER) framework increasingly adopted in history classrooms. Pupils learn to state a claim clearly, support it with specific evidence, and explain their reasoning explicitly.

## Teaching Claim Construction

### Progression Across Key Stages

The construction of historical claims should be taught progressively, with increasing sophistication as pupils advance:

**Key Stage 1 (Years 1-2):** Pupils begin by making simple claims based on evidence from stories and sources. They learn to distinguish between claims that are supported by evidence and those that are not.

**Key Stage 2 (Years 3-6):** Pupils develop more structured approaches to claim construction. They learn to use multiple sources, evaluate their reliability, and support claims with specific evidence. They begin to recognise that different sources may suggest different claims.

**Key Stage 3 (Years 7-9):** Pupils engage with more complex evidential reasoning. They learn to construct claims that address causation, significance, and change over time. They develop awareness of how historians' perspectives shape the claims they make.

**Key Stage 4 (Years 10-11):** Pupils construct extended arguments with multiple claims supported by carefully selected and evaluated evidence. They engage with historical interpretations, constructing claims about why historians disagree.

### Practical Classroom Strategies

**Source collections** provide pupils with multiple documents related to a historical question. Working with collections rather than isolated sources develops corroboration skills and supports more nuanced claim construction.

**Claim-testing activities** invite pupils to evaluate existing claims against evidence. By assessing whether claims are well-supported, pupils develop criteria for their own claim construction.

**Argument mapping** helps pupils visualise the structure of historical arguments, identifying claims, evidence, and reasoning connections. This makes the anatomy of argument visible and supports metacognitive awareness.

**Structured academic controversy** engages pupils in constructing and defending claims while critiquing opposing positions. This develops both argumentation skills and awareness of the contested nature of historical knowledge.

**Writing frames and scaffolds** support pupils in producing structured arguments. Frames such as "I claim that... because... The evidence for this is..." provide initial structure that can be gradually removed as pupils develop independence.

## Common Challenges and Misconceptions

### Pupil Misconceptions About Historical Claims

Several misconceptions commonly impede pupils' development as claim constructors:

**The certainty misconception:** Many pupils believe that historical claims are either definitively true or false. They need to learn that historical claims are provisional, subject to revision in light of new evidence or interpretation.

**The evidence-as-facts misconception:** Pupils often fail to distinguish between sources (the documents themselves) and evidence (the information extracted from them for a particular purpose). They need explicit teaching on how historians transform sources into evidence.

**The single-cause fallacy:** Pupils frequently seek single causes for complex events. They need to develop understanding of multiple causation and the interaction of different factors.

**The presentist trap:** Pupils may judge past actions by present values or assume that people in the past thought as we do. Contextualisation skills help overcome this tendency.

**The confirmation bias:** Pupils may seek only evidence that supports their preferred claim. Teaching corroboration and counter-evidence address addresses this tendency.

### Addressing Assessment Challenges

Assessment of claim construction presents particular challenges:

**Process versus product:** While it is easier to assess the final argument pupils produce, the processes of sourcing, contextualisation, and corroboration are equally important. Assessment should address both.

**Authenticity:** Pupils may construct claims that appear sophisticated but represent little genuine historical thinking. Careful questioning about evidence selection and reasoning can reveal the depth of understanding.

**Transfer:** Pupils may demonstrate claim construction skills in structured tasks but fail to apply them independently. Assessment should include opportunities for independent application.

## The Significance of Claim Construction

Understanding how historians construct claims is not merely an academic exercise. It develops capacities that extend beyond the history classroom:

**Critical evaluation:** The ability to assess claims against evidence, recognise rhetorical strategies, and identify unsubstantiated assertions is essential for informed citizenship in an age of information overload.

**Intellectual humility:** Understanding that historical knowledge is constructed and provisional fosters appropriate intellectual humility—recognising the limits of what we can know while still pursuing knowledge with rigour.

**Argumentative competence:** The skills of constructing claims, supporting them with evidence, and responding to counter-arguments transfer to many domains of life and work.

**Appreciation for complexity:** Historical claim construction teaches that the past, like the present, resists simple explanations. This appreciation for complexity is a hallmark of mature thinking.

## Conclusion

Constructing historical claims is the heart of the discipline. It involves a sophisticated interplay of sourcing, contextualisation, corroboration, and reasoning that transforms fragmentary evidence into coherent arguments about the past. Teaching pupils to construct claims is teaching them to think historically—to go beyond passive reception of information to active engagement with how knowledge is made.

The frameworks and strategies outlined in this document provide a foundation for developing pupils' claim construction abilities from Key Stage 1 through Key Stage 4 and beyond. By making the processes of historical thinking visible and explicit, teachers can help pupils develop the disciplinary capabilities that will serve them as students of history and as informed citizens.

As Christine Counsell has argued, disciplinary knowledge is emancipatory. When pupils understand how historians construct claims, they are equipped not only to participate in historical discourse but to question and challenge claims about the past that they encounter. This critical capacity—this ability to ask "How do you know?" and "What is your evidence?"—is perhaps the most valuable outcome of history education.
