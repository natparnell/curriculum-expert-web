# Evidence and Sources in Depth

## Introduction: The Nature of Historical Evidence

Historical evidence forms the foundation upon which all historical understanding is built. Unlike the experimental sciences, historians cannot recreate the past in a laboratory; they must reconstruct it from fragmentary remains left behind. This fundamental constraint shapes every aspect of historical inquiry and makes the critical evaluation of evidence the central disciplinary skill that pupils must develop.

The National Curriculum for History (2013) recognises this by requiring pupils to "understand historical concepts such as continuity and change, cause and consequence, similarity, difference and significance, and use them to make connections, draw contrasts, analyse trends, frame historically-valid questions and create their own structured accounts, including written narratives and analyses." At the heart of this requirement lies the ability to work with evidence—interpreting sources, evaluating their reliability and utility, and synthesising multiple pieces of evidence to construct arguments.

Christine Counsell (2019) has emphasised that assessment in history must attend to "the dignity of the thing"—the specific, substantive content that gives historical study its meaning. When applied to source work, this principle reminds us that pupils must engage with the particularity of individual sources rather than applying generic analytical frameworks mechanically. Each source offers a unique window into the past, and effective teaching helps pupils to recognise both the possibilities and limitations inherent in every piece of evidence.

## Categories of Historical Sources

### Primary and Secondary Distinctions

The fundamental distinction between primary and secondary sources underpins all historical methodology. Primary sources are original materials created during the period under study—eyewitness accounts, official documents, artefacts, and contemporary records. Secondary sources are accounts produced after the events, which interpret, analyse, or synthesise primary evidence. This distinction, while foundational, is not always straightforward in practice.

For teaching purposes, it is essential to move beyond simplistic definitions. A textbook written in the twenty-first century about the Tudors is clearly secondary, but what of a Victorian history of the Civil Wars? What of a documentary film made in the 1970s about the Second World War? These sources occupy a more complex position, serving both as interpretations of past events and as primary sources for understanding the historical consciousness of their own periods.

The Library of Congress defines primary sources as "the raw materials of history—original documents and objects that were created at the time under study." However, History Skills (2023) notes that "primary sources can be quite old, they are often harder for students to find than secondary sources. However, as a result, are often the strongest evidence you can use." This observation highlights the paradox of primary source work: the most valuable evidence is often the most difficult to access and interpret.

### Classification by Type

Beyond the primary/secondary distinction, sources can be classified by their material form and mode of creation. These categories have significant implications for how historians and pupils approach their analysis.

**Written sources** include letters, diaries, official documents, laws, newspapers, pamphlets, and literary works. Each genre carries its own conventions and expectations. A private diary entry operates differently from a public proclamation; a parliamentary act serves different purposes from a contemporary newspaper editorial.

**Visual sources** encompass paintings, drawings, cartoons, photographs, maps, and diagrams. These sources communicate through image rather than text, requiring pupils to develop visual literacy alongside textual analysis skills. Facing History (2024) emphasises that "analyzing visual images—like paintings, photographs, political cartoons, and posters—is an important skill for understanding history."

**Material culture and archaeological evidence** includes artefacts, buildings, coins, pottery, tools, and other physical remains. Archaeologists study "human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture," working with "artifacts, architecture, biofacts or ecofacts, sites, and cultural landscapes" (Wikipedia, 2025). This category of evidence is particularly valuable for periods lacking written records.

**Oral and testimonial evidence** comprises eyewitness accounts, interviews, oral histories, and recorded testimonies. These sources capture lived experience but present particular challenges regarding memory, perspective, and the passage of time.

## Working with Written Sources

### Official and Administrative Documents

Government records, legal documents, and administrative archives form the backbone of much historical research. These sources offer apparent authority but require careful contextual analysis. When pupils encounter a parliamentary act, a court record, or a census return, they must consider questions of purpose, audience, and process.

Official documents were created for specific administrative purposes, not to provide transparent windows into past realities. A Poor Law record reveals official attitudes towards poverty and the operation of welfare systems, but it represents the perspective of administrators rather than the experiences of the poor themselves. Teaching pupils to read such documents against the grain—to identify what is present and what is absent, whose voices are heard and whose are silenced—develops sophisticated analytical capabilities.

The National Archives offers extensive collections of such documents for classroom use, including census records, military service papers, and government correspondence. These sources lend themselves to enquiry-based learning, where pupils construct understanding through direct engagement with authentic materials.

### Private Writings: Letters and Diaries

Personal documents offer apparent intimacy and authenticity, yet present their own analytical challenges. Diaries were rarely written as disinterested records; they served various psychological and social functions for their authors. Letters were composed with specific recipients in mind, shaped by the relationship between writer and reader.

Teaching pupils to analyse private writings requires attention to voice, register, and silences. What does the writer choose to record? What assumptions underlie their descriptions? How might the intended recipient have influenced what was written? These questions help pupils move beyond surface readings to deeper historical understanding.

The Brilliant Club's primary source toolkit (2020) suggests that pupils should begin source analysis by "identifying the nature of the source." For private writings, this means recognising the genre conventions of letter-writing or diary-keeping in the relevant period and understanding how these conventions shaped what was recorded.

### Printed and Published Materials

Newspapers, pamphlets, books, and other printed materials represent a different category of written source. These documents were produced for public circulation, shaped by commercial considerations, editorial policies, and intended audiences. They offer insight into public discourse but cannot be taken as simple reflections of public opinion.

Newspaper reports of historical events require particularly careful handling. Editorial decisions about coverage, headlines, and comment all shape how events were presented to readers. Comparing multiple newspaper accounts of the same event—perhaps from publications with different political orientations—can reveal the constructed nature of news and the role of perspective in shaping narrative.

## Working with Visual Sources

### Paintings and Drawings

Visual fine arts provide rich historical evidence but require deliberate analytical approaches. Carolyn Halpin-Healy, quoted by TeachingHistory.org, explains that analysis should "begin by describing the object—to analyse its structure, to consider the circumstance of its creation—and only then to propose an interpretation of the meaning of the piece."

This structured approach prevents pupils from jumping to conclusions based on superficial impressions. When examining a history painting depicting a famous battle or historical scene, pupils should first identify what is actually shown: the composition, the figures present, the setting, the style. Only then should they consider questions of accuracy, interpretation, and the artist's purposes.

History paintings were often produced long after the events they depict, based on written accounts and artistic imagination rather than eyewitness observation. Understanding this helps pupils recognise that such works are themselves historical interpretations, valuable for understanding how past generations viewed their history as much as for reconstructing what actually occurred.

### Photographs

Photography occupies a unique position in historical evidence. Since its invention in the 1830s, photography has offered apparent documentary objectivity—yet photographs are as constructed and interpretive as any other source. Decisions about framing, timing, captioning, and selection all shape the meaning of photographic evidence.

Pupils often approach photographs with uncritical acceptance, assuming that the camera cannot lie. Effective teaching challenges this assumption while building understanding of how photographs operate as historical sources. Questions of provenance become particularly important: who took the photograph, when, and for what purpose? Was it candid or posed? How was it originally presented and received?

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (2020) provides guidance on teaching with survivor testimony and photographic evidence, emphasising that "eyewitness testimonies are no less nor more reliable than other sources." This principle applies equally to photographic evidence: photographs offer valuable perspectives but must be evaluated critically alongside other sources.

### Cartoons and Propaganda

Political cartoons and propaganda materials present historical argument in visual form. These sources wear their purposes openly—they are designed to persuade, to caricature, to mobilise opinion. This clarity of purpose makes them accessible entry points for source analysis while still offering analytical depth.

When analysing cartoons, pupils should identify the symbols, stereotypes, and visual conventions employed. Cartoons rely on shared cultural knowledge; understanding what contemporaries would have recognised in a cartoon helps pupils enter the mental world of the past. The exaggeration and simplification inherent in cartooning can reveal contemporary attitudes and assumptions more clearly than sober prose.

Propaganda posters from the World Wars offer particularly rich material for classroom analysis. Government campaigns to recruit soldiers, encourage economy, or shape civilian morale produced striking visual materials that illuminate both official priorities and the techniques of mass persuasion.

## Material Culture and Archaeological Evidence

### Artefacts and Objects

Material culture—the physical objects created and used by past societies—provides evidence that complements and sometimes contradicts written sources. Archaeologists reconstruct past human behaviour and history through "the material remains that peoples left behind," documenting, describing, measuring, classifying, analysing, and interpreting material culture (University of Nebraska Press, 2024).

For periods before widespread literacy and for aspects of life poorly documented in written records, material culture offers essential evidence. Everyday objects—tools, clothing, household items, personal possessions—can reveal how ordinary people lived, worked, and understood their world. The Archaeological Institute of America notes that interpretation follows excavation and analysis: "the archaeologist is responsible for interpreting the findings and explaining the story of the site and the significance of the finds to the people of the past."

Teaching with artefacts develops different analytical skills from those used with written or visual sources. Pupils must learn to read objects: identifying materials, manufacturing techniques, signs of wear and use, stylistic features, and contextual associations. Handling collections—whether in museums or through classroom loan boxes—provides sensory engagement that deepens historical understanding.

### Buildings and Sites

The built environment preserves historical evidence in three dimensions. Buildings embody the technologies, aesthetic preferences, social structures, and economic conditions of their periods of construction and modification. A medieval church, a Georgian townhouse, a Victorian factory, or a 1960s housing estate each offers evidence about the society that created it.

Site visits and local history enquiries can make this evidence accessible to pupils. Examining how buildings have been modified over time reveals changing needs and technologies. Comparing buildings across different periods illuminates broader historical developments in architecture, urban planning, and social organisation.

The concept of stratigraphy—the layering of deposits over time—helps pupils understand how archaeological sites preserve chronological sequences. Just as the cross-section of a road cut reveals layers of different road surfaces spanning decades, archaeological excavation reveals the accumulated material remains of human activity over centuries.

## Oral History and Testimonial Evidence

### The Nature of Oral Evidence

Oral history has developed significantly as a historical methodology since the mid-twentieth century. Personal testimonies offer access to lived experience and individual perspective that written records rarely capture. However, oral evidence presents distinct challenges regarding reliability and interpretation.

The Smithsonian Institution Archives (2024) advises that interviewers should ask narrators for "first-person information"—"memories that the narrator can provide on a reliable basis, e.g., events in which they participated or witnessed or decisions in which they took part." This guidance reflects the recognition that memory operates selectively and constructively rather than as simple recording.

ResearchGate (2009) discusses "Reliability and validity in oral history," noting that historians must consider "the different contextual frameworks within which testimonies have developed—legal, moral, and practical." What makes a testimony 'true' or 'trustworthy' in the eyes of the observer varies across these contexts.

### Memory and Perspective

Memory is not a fixed record but an active, constructive process. Every act of recollection involves reconstruction, shaped by the time elapsed, subsequent experiences, cultural frameworks, and the context of narration. Pupils must understand that eyewitness accounts are not simple truths but interpretations offered from particular perspectives.

This does not mean that oral testimony is unusable—only that it requires careful critical analysis. As the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum notes, oral testimonies are "no less nor more reliable than other sources." Like all historical evidence, they offer valuable perspectives that must be evaluated in context and corroborated where possible.

### Teaching with Testimony

Survivor testimonies from the Holocaust, eyewitness accounts of significant events, and recorded oral histories provide powerful classroom resources. However, such materials require sensitive handling and careful framing. Pupils need guidance in what to listen for, how to evaluate what they hear, and how to place individual testimony within broader historical understanding.

The Facing History approach to teaching with testimony emphasises creating space for reflection while maintaining historical rigour. Testimony provides emotional engagement and human connection, but pupils must also develop the analytical skills to evaluate such sources critically. This balance between empathy and critical thinking lies at the heart of effective history education.

## Provenance: The Foundation of Source Evaluation

### Understanding Provenance

Provenance—the origin and history of a source—provides essential context for evaluation. Knowing who created a source, when, where, and for what purpose enables informed assessment of its reliability and utility. The Tutor Team (2021) emphasises that "learning to assess document value via provenance is a vital skill for historians and is essential to carry out any historical research."

Provenance analysis begins with basic identification: the author, date, location, and type of source. But effective analysis goes deeper to consider the circumstances of creation. Was the source produced voluntarily or under compulsion? For public or private consumption? In routine circumstances or exceptional moments? These contextual factors shape how historians read and evaluate sources.

Keystage History (2023) suggests pedagogical strategies for teaching provenance: "you could start with the provenance, without the source itself, and ask students to predict what it will say." This approach helps pupils understand how provenance shapes content and develops their ability to anticipate source perspectives before reading.

### Authorial Position and Purpose

Understanding who created a source requires attention to their position, interests, and likely purposes. A government minister writing to colleagues operates from different motivations than a dissident writing secretly; a commercial advertisement serves different purposes than a personal diary entry.

Pupils should develop the habit of asking: what did this person want to achieve? What constraints operated upon them? What audience were they addressing? These questions help pupils move beyond surface content to understand the rhetorical situation from which the source emerged.

Authorial position also shapes what sources can reliably tell us. A colonial administrator's report on indigenous populations reflects colonial assumptions and concerns; it cannot be taken as objective description. Teaching pupils to read sources critically—to recognise how position shapes perspective—develops sophisticated historical thinking.

### Circulation and Reception

Provenance includes not only creation but also circulation and reception. How was the source originally distributed? Who had access to it? How was it received by contemporaries? Understanding the life of a source beyond its creation illuminates its historical significance.

A pamphlet that circulated widely and provoked controversy played a different historical role than one that remained unread. A photograph published in a mass-circulation newspaper reached different audiences than one kept in a private family album. These considerations affect how historians evaluate the significance and representativeness of sources.

## Reliability and Utility Analysis

### Conceptualising Reliability

Source reliability concerns the accuracy, truthfulness, and trustworthiness of historical evidence. However, reliability is not an absolute quality but a relative judgment made in context. A source can be reliable for some purposes but not others; accurate in some respects but misleading in others.

Owl Tutors (2024) advises that pupils should "start by identifying the nature of the source. For example, is it a diary, an Act of Parliament, a letter or a public speech?" This identification provides the foundation for reliability assessment, as different source types have different relationships to truth and accuracy.

The Brilliant Club's toolkit (2020) suggests assessment activities focusing on "analysing the provenance of a range of sources." By comparing multiple sources on the same topic, pupils develop understanding of how reliability varies and how different sources can be used in combination.

### Assessing Utility

Utility differs from reliability: a source can be unreliable yet highly useful, or reliable but of limited utility. Utility concerns what a source can tell us and how it contributes to historical understanding. An obviously biased pamphlet may be extremely useful for understanding the attitudes it promotes; a factually accurate but banal document may contribute little to historical argument.

The concept of utility encourages pupils to consider what questions a source can help answer. A source may be useful for understanding attitudes but not events; for revealing official perspectives but not popular opinion; for documenting what people believed but not what was true. Matching sources to appropriate questions is a key historical skill.

Christine Counsell's emphasis on "the dignity of the thing" applies particularly to utility assessment. Each source offers specific possibilities for historical understanding, and effective teaching helps pupils recognise and articulate these possibilities in their particularity.

### The Problem of Bias

Bias—the partiality or prejudice inherent in sources—presents both problems and opportunities for historians. Recognising bias is essential for critical evaluation, yet bias itself becomes evidence when properly understood. A biased source does not simply mislead; it reveals the perspectives, assumptions, and purposes that shaped it.

Teaching pupils about bias requires moving beyond simple identification ("this source is biased") to sophisticated analysis ("this source reflects these particular interests and assumptions, which shape its account in these ways"). The Brilliant Club (2020) offers exercises in comparing bias across sources, helping pupils develop nuanced understanding of how perspective operates.

Propaganda materials illustrate this principle clearly. Their overt bias makes them unreliable as factual accounts but highly useful for understanding the attitudes and techniques of persuasion they embody. Pupils learn to read such
