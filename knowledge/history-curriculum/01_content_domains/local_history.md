# Local History in the Primary Curriculum

## Overview

Local history holds a distinctive and important position within the primary history curriculum. Unlike national or world history topics, local history engages pupils with the immediate environment of their school, community, and region, making the past tangible, relevant, and personally meaningful. The National Curriculum for history (2014) explicitly includes local history as both a statutory requirement at Key Stage 2 and as a recommended approach at Key Stage 1, where "changes within living memory" can be explored through the local area.

This knowledge file explores the rationale for teaching local history, the statutory requirements, pedagogical approaches, available resources, and practical strategies for developing meaningful local history enquiries. It draws on guidance from the Historical Association, Historic England's Heritage Schools programme, and Ofsted's expectations for curriculum quality.

## The Rationale for Local History

### Making History Tangible

Local history transforms abstract historical concepts into concrete, observable realities. When pupils study the Victorian era through the history of their own school building, examine how their high street has changed over time, or investigate the impact of the railway on their town, history becomes something they can see, touch, and walk through. This tangibility supports pupils' understanding of historical concepts such as change, continuity, cause, and consequence.

The Historical Association emphasises that local history provides "a way in" to broader historical understanding. As pupils investigate their immediate environment, they develop transferable historical skills and conceptual understanding that can be applied to more distant periods and places. Local history serves as the foundation upon which broader historical knowledge is built.

### Developing a Sense of Place and Identity

Place-based education, of which local history is a central component, promotes learning rooted in "the unique history, environment, culture, economy, literature, and art of a particular place." For primary pupils, understanding the history of where they live contributes to their developing sense of identity and belonging. They come to see themselves as part of a continuing story, connected to those who lived in their community before them and responsible to those who will come after.

Ofsted's inspection framework recognises the importance of personal development and preparing pupils for life in modern Britain. Local history contributes to these aims by fostering community connections, developing pride in local heritage, and encouraging active citizenship through engagement with local preservation and improvement initiatives.

### Accessibility and Inclusion

Local history is inherently democratic—all schools have a local area to study, regardless of their geographic location or economic circumstances. While some schools may be located in areas with obvious historical landmarks such as castles or stately homes, every community has a history worth exploring: the development of housing estates, changes in local industry, the impact of transport infrastructure, or the experiences of different communities who have made the area their home.

For pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, local history can be particularly powerful. It validates their own experiences and environment, demonstrating that their community has a story worth telling. The Heritage Schools programme has shown that engagement with local heritage can improve pupil outcomes, particularly for those at risk of disengagement.

## Statutory Requirements and Curriculum Placement

### Key Stage 1: Changes Within Living Memory

The Key Stage 1 National Curriculum requires pupils to study "changes within living memory." While this can be approached through national topics such as the development of communication technology, the curriculum guidance suggests that "where appropriate, these should be used to reveal aspects of change in national life." This provides an ideal opportunity to explore local changes, using the familiar environment of the school and immediate community to introduce historical concepts.

Suggested approaches for Key Stage 1 include:

**The School's Own History:** Investigating how the school has changed within living memory provides an accessible starting point. Older photographs of the school, former teachers' memories, changes to the school building or uniform, and developments in play equipment all offer concrete examples of change over time. This topic connects directly to pupils' own experiences while introducing fundamental historical concepts.

**The Local High Street:** Comparing photographs of the local shopping area from different decades reveals changes in shops, transport, clothing, and street furniture. This can be linked to broader changes in retail, from independent shops to chain stores and the impact of online shopping. Visits to local archives or libraries often yield excellent visual sources.

**Housing and Homes:** Exploring how housing in the local area has changed—from Victorian terraces to post-war estates to modern developments—introduces pupils to architectural history while addressing social themes of community, family life, and urban development. Oral history interviews with older residents about their childhood homes provide powerful primary sources.

### Key Stage 2: A Local History Study

At Key Stage 2, a local history study is a statutory requirement. The National Curriculum specifies that pupils should study "a local history study," allowing schools flexibility in choosing their specific focus. This study should be planned to build upon prior learning and prepare pupils for more complex historical understanding.

The Key Stage 2 local history study can be approached in several ways:

**Thematic Study:** Focusing on a particular theme such as transport, industry, or migration through the lens of the local area. For example, a study of how the railway came to the town, its impact on employment and housing, and how transport has continued to change through the motor age to the present day.

**Chronological Study:** Tracing the history of the locality from earliest times to the present, identifying key periods of change and continuity. This might include prehistoric settlement (evidenced by local archaeology), Roman occupation, medieval development, the impact of the Industrial Revolution, wartime experiences, and post-war changes.

**Site-Based Study:** Focusing on a particular significant local site such as a castle, abbey, factory, or historic building. This approach lends itself to in-depth investigation using a range of sources and often includes site visits that bring learning to life.

**Biographical Study:** Exploring the life of a significant local figure and their contribution to national or international achievements. Many communities have notable individuals—industrialists, reformers, inventors, or activists—whose stories illuminate broader historical themes.

### Integration with Broader Curriculum Planning

Ofsted's deep dive inspections examine how curriculum components fit together to build pupils' knowledge over time. Local history should not be taught as an isolated topic but integrated with other history units to develop coherent understanding.

For example:
- The local Victorian industrialist studied in Year 3 connects to the national study of Victorian Britain in Year 5
- The local castle investigated in Year 2 provides concrete experience of medieval life before the more abstract study of the Norman Conquest in Year 4
- Changes in local transport link to studies of the Industrial Revolution and twentieth-century technological change
- The experience of local people during World War II connects to the national and global story of the war

Effective curriculum planning makes these connections explicit, ensuring that local history serves as a foundation for broader understanding rather than a disconnected digression.

## Pedagogical Approaches to Local History

### The Enquiry Approach

The Historical Association advocates an enquiry-based approach to local history, structuring learning around historical questions that pupils investigate using evidence. A well-designed local history enquiry follows a clear structure:

**The Enquiry Question:** An open, engaging question that frames the investigation. Examples include: "How has our high street changed since our grandparents were young?" "Why did our town grow so quickly in the nineteenth century?" "What was life like for children in our area during World War II?" Effective enquiry questions are specific enough to be answerable using available sources but substantial enough to sustain investigation.

**Source Investigation:** Pupils engage with a range of primary sources including photographs, maps, census records, oral histories, artefacts, and documents. The accessibility of local sources is a significant advantage—many can be examined in the classroom, local library, or through digital archives.

**Analysis and Interpretation:** Pupils analyse sources for information, evaluate their reliability, compare different accounts, and begin to understand how historians construct knowledge from evidence. Local history provides excellent opportunities for this because pupils can often access multiple perspectives on the same events.

**Drawing Conclusions:** Pupils synthesise their findings to answer the enquiry question, recognising the limitations of the available evidence and the possibility of different interpretations.

**Communicating Findings:** Pupils present their conclusions through various formats—displays, presentations, digital projects, or contributions to local heritage projects. Authentic audiences, such as local history societies or community groups, add purpose and motivation.

### Using the Local Environment

The immediate environment is a rich learning resource for local history. Effective teaching uses the local area in multiple ways:

**Fieldwork and Site Visits:** Walking tours of the local area, visits to heritage sites, and exploration of the built environment provide direct experience of historical evidence. Pupils learn to "read" the landscape, identifying architectural styles, understanding how street patterns reflect historical development, and recognising evidence of past industries or transport infrastructure.

Fieldwork is not merely an enjoyable extra but an essential component of historical learning. When pupils examine the construction of local buildings, compare old and new architecture, or map the location of historical features, they develop skills of observation and inference that are fundamental to historical thinking.

**Oral History:** Interviewing older residents about their experiences provides unique primary sources while fostering intergenerational connections. The Historical Association provides guidance on conducting oral history projects with primary pupils, including ethical considerations, interview techniques, and approaches to analysing testimony.

**Handling Artefacts:** Objects from the local past—whether borrowed from museums, heritage organisations, or collected by families—provide tangible connections to historical periods. Artefact analysis develops pupils' skills in deduction, inference, and evidence evaluation.

### Working with Heritage Organisations

Historic England's Heritage Schools programme supports schools in making effective use of local heritage resources. The programme provides:

**Teacher Training:** CPD sessions on planning and teaching local history, using heritage resources, and developing effective fieldwork.

**Resource Materials:** How-to guides, case studies, image banks, and teaching kits that support curriculum development.

**Connections to Heritage Providers:** Links to local archives, museums, historic sites, and heritage organisations that can support school history teaching.

**Recognition and Accreditation:** Heritage Schools Award for schools demonstrating effective local history provision.

The programme emphasises that heritage is not merely "old things" but the full range of physical and cultural resources that tell the story of a place. This includes listed buildings, conservation areas, archaeological sites, landscapes, and intangible heritage such as traditions, dialects, and community memories.

## Sources for Local History

### Archives and Record Offices

Local authority record offices (often called county record offices or local history centres) hold a wealth of primary sources suitable for primary history:

**Maps:** Tithe maps, enclosure maps, Ordnance Survey maps from different periods, and estate maps show how the landscape has changed over time. Comparing maps from different periods is an excellent way to demonstrate change and continuity.

**Photographs:** Local photographic collections document street scenes, buildings, events, and people from the Victorian period to the present day. Many archives have digitised their collections, making them accessible in the classroom.

**Census Records:** Census returns from 1841 to 1921 (and soon 1931) provide detailed information about who lived in particular streets, their occupations, family structures, and places of birth. Pupils can trace the residents of their own street or school over several decades.

**School Records:** Log books, admission registers, and punishment books from local schools provide fascinating insights into educational history and children's lives in the past.

**Newspapers:** Local newspapers report on events, big and small, providing contemporary accounts of everything from royal visits to village fêtes. They also offer insights into how people in the past viewed their world through editorials and letters.

### Museums and Heritage Sites

Local museums often have collections specifically related to the area's history, including artefacts, photographs, and documents. Many offer school programmes including handling sessions, workshops, and outreach visits. Historic sites in or near the local area provide immersive experiences that bring history to life.

The Association of Independent Museums and Museums Association both provide resources for schools wishing to work with museum collections.

### Digital Resources

An increasing range of local history resources is available online:

**Historic England Archive:** Over 10,000 educational images from the national collection, searchable by location and theme.

**Britain from Above:** Historic aerial photographs of Britain from the early twentieth century, showing how towns and landscapes have changed.

**Old Maps:** Digital collections of historical maps, many georeferenced to allow comparison with modern maps.

**Local History Online:** Resources, forums, and links to local history societies across the UK.

**University and Library Digital Collections:** Many universities and major libraries have digitised local history materials, including manuscripts, photographs, and newspapers.

### Family and Community Sources

Pupils and their families can be valuable sources of local history material. Old photographs, documents, artefacts, and family stories all contribute to historical understanding. Family history projects, where pupils investigate their own family's connection to the local area, can be powerful learning experiences while developing speaking and listening skills as pupils share their findings.

## Progression in Local History

### Early Years Foundation Stage

While not part of the statutory history curriculum, the EYFS framework includes "Understanding the World," which encompasses learning about the past. Local history in the early years focuses on:

- Talking about past and present events in children's own lives and the lives of family members
- Identifying similarities and differences between the past and present
- Exploring the immediate environment through walks, visits, and observations
- Handling simple historical artefacts and talking about what they might be

The Ofsted inspection framework for the EYFS expects inspectors to consider how provision builds foundations for future learning. Early experiences of exploring the local environment and talking about change over time prepare children for more formal history study in Key Stage 1.

### Key Stage 1: Developing Foundations

By the end of Key Stage 1, pupils should be able to:

- Identify changes within living memory in their local area
- Use simple sources such as photographs and objects to find out about the past
- Ask and answer questions about local history
- Begin to understand that there are different ways to find out about the past
- Talk about what they have found out using simple historical terms

Local history topics at this stage should be tightly focused and concrete. Rather than attempting to cover the entire history of the locality, select specific, manageable themes such as "how our school has changed" or "shops in our high street then and now."

### Lower Key Stage 2: Building Enquiry Skills

By the end of Year 4, pupils should be able to:

- Conduct historical enquiries about their local area using a range of sources
- Understand that different sources provide different types of information
- Begin to evaluate sources in simple terms (Who made this? When? Why?)
- Identify similarities and differences between periods in local history
- Place local events in a broader national context
- Present their findings in organised ways

Local history studies at this stage can be more ambitious in scope, perhaps tracing the history of a particular site or investigating a significant local event. Pupils should engage with a wider range of sources and begin to understand that historical knowledge is constructed from evidence.

### Upper Key Stage 2: Developing Historical Thinking

By the end of Year 6, pupils should be able to:

- Devise historically valid questions about change, cause, similarity, difference, and significance in their local area
- Select and combine information from different sources
- Understand that sources may be interpreted differently and begin to suggest reasons why
- Connect local, national, and international history, understanding how local events reflect or result from broader developments
- Evaluate the usefulness and reliability of sources based on their nature, origin, and purpose
- Communicate their understanding in sophisticated ways, acknowledging uncertainty and alternative interpretations

Upper Key Stage 2 local history should challenge pupils to think historically, not merely to collect information. Enquiries might address questions such as: "Was the coming of the railway good for our town?" (addressing cause, consequence, and interpretation) or "Why do different sources tell different stories about the same event?" (addressing source evaluation and perspective).

## Addressing Diversity and Inclusion in Local History

### Whose History?

A critical question for local history is whose stories are being told. Traditional local history often focused on "great men," notable buildings, and celebrated events, while marginalising the experiences of working people, women, migrants, and minority communities. A diverse and inclusive local history curriculum actively seeks out these hidden histories.

This might include:
- The experiences of industrial workers in local factories or mines
- The lives of domestic servants in large local houses
- The contributions of migrant communities to local industry and culture
- Women's roles in wartime, suffrage campaigns, or social reform
- The experiences of children in workhouses, schools, or evacuation
- LGBTQ+ history and the stories of individuals who lived differently

The Historical Association's resources on diversity in history provide guidance on researching and teaching these often-overlooked aspects of local heritage.

### Controversial and Difficult History

Local history, like all history, includes difficult and contested episodes. Industrial accidents, wartime bombing, racial tensions, or disputes between communities may all be part of a locality's history. These topics should not be avoided but approached with sensitivity and appropriate support.

Strategies for teaching difficult local history include:
- Ensuring pupils have sufficient contextual knowledge before addressing traumatic topics
- Using age-appropriate sources and avoiding gratuitous detail
- Providing opportunities for pupils to discuss their feelings and questions
- Connecting past events to positive developments (how communities recovered, what was learned)
- Being aware that some pupils may have personal connections to difficult history

### Ensuring Representation

All pupils should be able to see themselves and their communities represented in local history. This means actively researching and including the histories of all groups who have lived in the area, not just the majority population. For schools in areas with significant minority communities, this might involve investigating when and why these communities arrived, their contributions to local life, and their experiences of acceptance or discrimination.

## Assessment in Local History

### Assessing Knowledge and Understanding

Assessment in local history should evaluate pupils' grasp of both substantive knowledge (what happened in the local past) and disciplinary knowledge (how we know about it and how we construct historical understanding).

Effective assessment tasks might include:
- Written explanations of how the local area has changed and why
- Source-based questions requiring pupils to extract information and draw inferences
- Comparisons of different periods or places, using local examples
- Evaluation of the usefulness of different sources for particular enquiries
- Extended writing addressing enquiry questions, showing understanding of how evidence supports conclusions

### Assessing Historical Skills

Local history provides excellent opportunities to assess historical skills in authentic contexts:

**Chronological Understanding:** Can pupils place local events in the correct order? Can they use dates and period terms accurately when discussing local history?

**Source Analysis:** Can pupils extract information from local sources such as photographs, maps, and documents? Can they begin to evaluate the reliability and usefulness of sources?

**Historical Enquiry:** Can pupils ask valid historical questions about their local area? Can they select appropriate sources to investigate these questions?

**Communication:** Can pupils present their findings clearly, using historical vocabulary and supporting their claims with evidence?

### Using Assessment to Inform Teaching

Assessment in local history should inform future planning. If pupils struggle to connect local events to national developments, this suggests a need for more explicit teaching of these connections. If pupils find it difficult to evaluate sources, this indicates the need for more scaffolded practice in source analysis.

The concrete nature of local history makes it particularly suitable for formative assessment. Teachers can observe pupils handling artefacts, discussing photographs, and exploring the local environment, gaining immediate insights into their developing understanding.

## Cross-Curricular Connections

### Geography

Local history and geography are natural partners. Historical maps develop geographical skills while providing historical evidence. Understanding how the physical geography of an area influenced its settlement and development is essential for both subjects. Fieldwork in the local area contributes to both geographical and historical learning.

### Literacy

Local history provides authentic contexts for developing literacy skills. Reading historical sources, including challenging texts such as nineteenth-century documents, develops comprehension skills. Writing about local history—whether explanatory texts, narratives, or persuasive pieces about heritage preservation—provides meaningful writing purposes. Speaking and listening skills are developed through oral history interviews, presentations, and discussions.

### Mathematics

Handling dates and timelines develops chronological understanding and number skills. Analysing census data involves data handling and statistics. Measuring and mapping develop spatial awareness and mathematical reasoning. The real-world context of local history makes these mathematical applications meaningful.

### Art and Design

Artefacts, buildings, and historical photographs provide inspiration for artwork. Architectural drawing develops observational skills. Creating reconstructions or models of historical scenes combines historical understanding with design and construction skills.

### Computing

Digital technologies support local history in multiple ways: digital cameras for documenting fieldwork, databases for organising research, presentation software for sharing findings, and online archives for accessing sources. Older pupils might create digital timelines, virtual tours, or simple websites showcasing their local history research.

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Limited Local Sources

Some schools feel their area lacks obvious historical sources or significant historical events. However, every locality has a history worth exploring. The challenge is often not lack of sources but knowing where to find them.

**Solutions:**
- Contact the local record office or history centre for guidance on available sources
- Engage with the Heritage Schools programme for support and resources
- Explore online archives such as Historic England's collections
- Consider "mundane" sources such as housing developments, shopping changes, or transport routes as valid historical topics
- Involve the community—older residents, local history societies, and families may hold valuable sources

### Lack of Teacher Confidence

Some teachers feel they lack sufficient knowledge of their local area to teach it effectively. This is understandable, particularly for teachers who are not from the locality themselves.

**Solutions:**
- The enquiry approach positions teachers as co-learners with pupils, investigating together
- Local history organisations often provide CPD and can advise on resources
- Start with topics close to the school that are readily observable
- Build knowledge gradually, adding depth to the curriculum year by year
- Use published schemes and resources from the Historical Association and other providers

### Time Constraints

With an already packed curriculum, some schools struggle to find time for local history alongside national and world history topics.

**Solutions:**
- Integrate local history with other topics rather than treating it as a separate unit
- Use local examples to illustrate national themes
- Consider the local history study as providing depth while broader topics provide breadth
- Make use of the local environment for shorter, ongoing investigations rather than discrete units

### Ensuring Progression

Without careful planning, local history can become repetitive, with pupils studying similar topics in different years without developing more sophisticated understanding.

**Solutions:**
- Plan the local history curriculum across key stages to ensure progression in both content and skills
- Use different types of enquiry in different years (thematic, chronological, site-based, biographical)
- Ensure that each local history study builds on prior learning and prepares for future study
- Make explicit connections between local, national, and international history

## Case Studies in Local History

### Case Study 1: The School as History (Key Stage 1)

A Year 2 class investigated how their school had changed over time. The enquiry began with a photograph of the school from the 1950s, prompting questions about what was the same and different. Pupils interviewed a former pupil (now a grandparent of a current student) who shared memories of her school days. They examined old log books from the school archive, discovering how school life had changed—different punishments, the impact of wartime evacuation, and the addition of new buildings.

The enquiry concluded with pupils creating a "then and now" display for the school entrance, explaining to parents and visitors how the school had changed. This local study provided a concrete foundation for later studies of Victorian education and twentieth-century childhood.

### Case Study 2: The Coming of the Railway (Key Stage 2)

A Year 4 class studied the impact of the railway on their town in the nineteenth century. Using maps from before and after the railway arrived, census records showing the growth of population, and photographs of the railway station and associated development, pupils investigated how the railway had transformed the local area.

The enquiry question "Was the railway good for our town?" required pupils to consider different perspectives—those who gained employment, those whose homes were demolished for the railway works, the environmental impact, and the connection to broader industrial and economic changes. Pupils wrote balanced arguments supported by evidence, developing both historical understanding and literacy skills.

This local study connected to the national study of the Industrial Revolution in Year 5, with pupils able to understand abstract national developments through the concrete example of their own town's experience.

### Case Study 3: Hidden Histories (Upper Key Stage 2)

A Year 6 class focused on uncovering the histories of underrepresented groups in their local area. Working with local archives and community groups, they researched the experiences of Caribbean migrants who came to work in local factories in the 1950s and 1960s, the lives of women in domestic service in Victorian times, and the experiences of disabled people in the workhouse.

This inclusive approach ensured that all pupils could see their own communities represented in the history curriculum. It also developed sophisticated historical understanding as pupils considered why some stories are told while others are forgotten, and how historians can recover hidden histories.

## Resources for Teaching Local History

### Historical Association

The Historical Association provides extensive resources for teaching local history, including:
- Primary History magazine with regular features on local history

## Conclusion

Local history is far more than a statutory requirement to be ticked off the curriculum—it is a powerful approach that makes history meaningful, develops essential skills, and connects pupils to their community and heritage. By investigating the history of their immediate environment, pupils develop the skills and conceptual understanding that underpin all historical learning.

Effective local history teaching requires careful planning to ensure progression, integration with the broader curriculum, and sensitivity to diversity and inclusion. It benefits enormously from partnerships with heritage organisations, archives, museums, and the local community.

Ofsted's emphasis on curriculum quality, including the coherence and sequencing of learning, applies fully to local history. When well-planned, local history provides the foundation upon which pupils build their understanding of national and global history, making the past relevant and the discipline of history accessible to all learners.
