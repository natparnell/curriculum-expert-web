# Diversity in History: Principles, Content and Pedagogical Approaches

## Introduction: Defining Diversity in the History Curriculum

Diversity in history education refers to the inclusion of multiple perspectives, voices and experiences that reflect the complexity of human societies across time and place. It moves beyond the traditional focus on political, military and economic history dominated by elite white European men to embrace the histories of women, working-class people, ethnic minorities, indigenous peoples, LGBTQ+ communities and those from the Global South. The Historical Association (HA) has consistently advocated for curricula that enable pupils to understand that "people were more rounded and complex than the labels people in power/society gave them" and that historical actors "do not just appear in our curriculum to be 'done unto' by people in power."

The concept of diversity extends beyond simply adding marginalised voices to an otherwise unchanged narrative. As research from the Universities of Manchester and Cambridge has demonstrated through the influential "Our Migration Story" project, genuine curriculum diversity requires a fundamental reconsideration of whose stories are told, whose perspectives are centred and how historical significance is determined. This means asking critical questions about any historical enquiry: Does it help pupils understand the diverse past in ways that illuminate the diverse present? Does it allow pupils to study people as "fully human" regardless of whether they were "white, rich, northern European and male"?

The current National Curriculum for history in England (2014) provides flexibility for schools to teach diverse histories, though critics have noted that the prescribed content retains a strong emphasis on British "island story" at the expense of global connections and the contributions of Britain's ethnic minority communities. However, the Department for Education has stated that "pupils should be taught about different societies, and how different groups have contributed to the development of Britain, including the voices and experience of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic people."

## Why Diversity Matters: The Educational Case

### Cognitive and Academic Benefits

Teaching diverse histories develops pupils' historical thinking by exposing them to multiple perspectives on the same events. When pupils engage with sources from different social positions—enslaved people and enslavers, colonised peoples and colonisers, workers and industrialists—they develop sophisticated skills in evaluating bias, understanding causation and recognising that all historical accounts are constructed from particular viewpoints. The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities (CRED, 2021) noted that teaching history from multiple perspectives is "a vital element of becoming a citizen."

Research by Harris and Reynolds (2014) has shown that when pupils encounter transnational themes such as migration linked to local history, this "would present an inclusive local identity without requiring a 'radical overhaul' of the curriculum." The enquiry-based approach advocated by the Historical Association enables pupils to construct their own understanding of the past through engagement with diverse evidence rather than receiving a single authorised narrative.

### Identity, Belonging and Engagement

For pupils from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, the absence of their ancestors' histories from the curriculum can reinforce messages of marginalisation and exclusion. As Paul Campbell's research at the University of Leicester found, "the lack of a sufficiently diverse or decolonised curriculum and faculty meant it was often difficult for black students to be able to connect content and assessments directly to their own lived realities." This disconnection has been linked to lower engagement and achievement in history.

Conversely, when pupils see their own heritage reflected in the curriculum, this can significantly enhance engagement and academic outcomes. The Runnymede Trust's research found that pupils are increasingly likely to demand the inclusion of diverse histories, and that when these are taught, all students—not only those from minority backgrounds—benefit from a "multi-perspective British 'Island Story'" that engenders inclusivity and challenges ethnocentric assumptions.

### Citizenship and Social Cohesion

The 1999 Macpherson Report and subsequent reviews concluded that a diverse, non-Eurocentric school curriculum focused on colonial and Black history is key to combatting racism in Britain. By understanding the historical roots of contemporary diversity, pupils develop the knowledge and critical thinking skills necessary to challenge stereotypes, recognise structural inequalities and participate constructively in democratic debate.

As the British Educational Research Association (BERA) has argued, teaching diverse histories enables students to "critically engage with a diverse canon of knowledge rather than being passive recipients of it." This transformative potential extends beyond individual classrooms to contribute to broader social cohesion in an increasingly diverse society.

## Key Content Areas for Diverse Histories

### Black British History

Black British history encompasses over two millennia of African presence in Britain, from the Roman period through to contemporary Black British communities. The National Curriculum provides opportunities to teach aspects of this history, particularly at Key Stage 3 where the transatlantic slave trade, its effects and eventual abolition form part of the prescribed content.

However, the Historical Association and other organisations have argued strongly against limiting Black history to the slave trade. While this topic is essential, an exclusive focus on Black people as victims of oppression presents a distorted and damaging narrative. Black British history also includes:

- **Early Black presence in Britain**: The African Roman soldiers on Hadrian's Wall, the Black Tudor courtiers and merchants documented by historian Miranda Kaufmann, and the Black Georgians who contributed to 18th-century British society.
- **The abolition movement**: The role of Black abolitionists such as Olaudah Equiano, Ignatius Sancho and Mary Prince, whose autobiographies and activism were crucial to the campaign against slavery.
- **Post-emancipation Black British life**: The settlement of Black communities in British port cities following the abolition of slavery, and their contributions to Victorian and Edwardian society.
- **The Windrush Generation**: The post-1945 migration from the Caribbean that fundamentally shaped modern Britain, including the experiences of the Windrush generation in rebuilding Britain after the Second World War and their ongoing struggles against discrimination.

The Black Curriculum organisation has developed comprehensive teaching materials covering these topics, emphasising that Black history should be taught as British history—integral to understanding the nation's development—not as a separate or peripheral topic.

### Migration and Mobility

Migration has been a constant feature of British history, from the Roman conquest through to the present day. The "Our Migration Story" project (run by the Runnymede Trust in partnership with Manchester and Cambridge universities) provides extensive resources documenting how migration has shaped Britain's economy, culture, politics and demographics.

Key migration themes for the curriculum include:

- **Historical migrations**: Anglo-Saxon settlement, Viking incursions, Norman Conquest, Huguenot refugees, Irish migration during the famine, Jewish refugees from Eastern Europe and Nazi Germany.
- **Colonial and post-colonial migration**: The movement of people from Britain's colonies and former colonies to the UK, including from South Asia, the Caribbean, Africa and Hong Kong.
- **Local migration histories**: Schools can work with pupils to uncover the specific migration stories of their own communities, connecting national narratives to local experience.

The AQA GCSE specification includes an optional unit on "Britain: Migration, empires and the people: c.790 to the present day," which enables schools to teach migration as a continuous thread through British history. This approach recognises that Britain has always been shaped by movement and that contemporary diversity has deep historical roots.

### The British Empire and Its Legacies

The British Empire represents one of the most significant and contested areas of history curriculum development. The Historical Association has published extensive guidance on teaching empire in ways that are balanced, rigorous and appropriate for different age groups.

Effective teaching of imperial history requires:

- **Multiple perspectives**: Examining the empire from the viewpoints of colonised peoples as well as colonisers, acknowledging resistance and agency alongside domination and exploitation.
- **Global contexts**: Understanding the empire within wider patterns of global exchange, competition and transformation.
- **Contemporary legacies**: Exploring how imperial history continues to shape contemporary Britain and the wider world, including patterns of inequality, cultural exchange and international relations.
- **Avoiding simplistic narratives**: Moving beyond both uncritical celebration and blanket condemnation to engage with the complexity and contradictions of imperial history.

Dr Sadiah Qureshi (University of Birmingham) notes that students are increasingly demanding engagement with imperial and racial histories as part of decolonising their learning. Teaching these topics well requires teachers to be secure in their subject knowledge and confident in handling potentially sensitive discussions.

### Women's History

Women's experiences have historically been marginalised in school history curricula, with female historical actors often appearing only as exceptions or footnotes to predominantly male narratives. Integrating women's history requires more than simply adding famous women to existing topics—it demands attention to the structural factors that shaped women's lives differently from men's.

Key areas include:

- **Political activism**: The suffrage movement, but also women's participation in earlier and later political struggles, including Chartism, abolitionism, trade unionism and civil rights movements.
- **Economic contribution**: Women's work in domestic industry, factories, agriculture and the service sector, as well as the gendered division of labour and its historical transformation.
- **Social and cultural history**: Women's experiences of family life, education, religion and leisure, and how these have changed over time.
- **Intersectionality**: Recognising that women's experiences differ significantly based on class, race, ethnicity and other factors.

The Historical Association's resources on women's history emphasise the importance of avoiding tokenism—simply inserting a few famous women into an otherwise unchanged curriculum—and instead developing genuine integration of gender as a category of historical analysis.

### Working-Class History and Local Communities

Social history has transformed the discipline over the past half-century, bringing attention to the lives of ordinary people whose experiences were excluded from traditional political and military narratives. For school history, this offers opportunities to connect national narratives to pupils' own communities and family histories.

Local history projects can investigate:
- The industrial and economic development of the local area
- Working conditions and labour organisation
- Migration patterns and community formation
- Changes in housing, leisure and daily life
- The impact of national events on local communities

The connection between local and national history is particularly powerful for helping pupils understand that "history" is not something that happened elsewhere to other people, but a process that has shaped their own families, communities and identities.

## Pedagogical Approaches for Teaching Diverse Histories

### Enquiry-Based Learning

The enquiry question approach advocated by the Historical Association provides an effective framework for teaching diverse histories. Rather than presenting a fixed narrative, enquiry questions pose genuine historical problems that pupils investigate through source work and argumentation.

Effective enquiries for diverse history might include:
- "Was Britain's role in the slave trade inevitable?"
- "How should we remember the British Empire?"
- "Why did the Windrush Generation come to Britain?"
- "What have women contributed to political change?"

These open-ended questions require pupils to engage with multiple perspectives, evaluate evidence and construct supported arguments—developing both historical knowledge and disciplinary thinking.

### Using Diverse Sources

The sources teachers select profoundly shape pupils' understanding of whose history matters. Diverse source selection includes:

- **Oral histories**: Recorded testimonies from migrants, workers, activists and ordinary people can bring personal voices into the classroom.
- **Material culture**: Objects, images and artefacts can provide access to the lives of people who left few written records.
- **Alternative archives**: Community archives, diaspora collections and online resources such as the "Our Migration Story" website offer perspectives absent from traditional archives.
- **Fiction and creative sources**: Literature, film and art by and about diverse communities can provide emotional engagement and different forms of historical insight.

When using sources from marginalised communities, teachers should be mindful of the power dynamics involved in their production and survival. Many historical sources about Black, working-class or colonised peoples were produced by outsiders or oppressors, and pupils need to develop skills in reading against the grain and recognising absences.

### Handling Sensitive Topics

Many diverse histories involve trauma, violence and ongoing political controversy. The Historical Association provides guidance on teaching sensitive topics including slavery, empire, the Holocaust and recent conflicts.

Key principles include:
- **Age-appropriateness**: Ensuring content and approaches are suitable for pupils' developmental stage
- **Contextualisation**: Providing sufficient historical context so pupils understand the specificity of past events
- **Avoiding trauma tourism**: Not sensationalising suffering or reducing people to their experience of victimisation
- **Recognising agency**: Highlighting resistance, resilience and achievement alongside oppression
- **Creating safe spaces**: Establishing classroom norms that enable respectful discussion of difficult topics
- **Teacher preparation**: Ensuring teachers have the subject knowledge and confidence to handle challenging content

When teaching slavery, for example, the Historical Association recommends ensuring pupils understand that slavery has existed in many forms across history and geography, that the transatlantic slave trade had distinctive features that made it particularly brutal and systematic, and that enslaved people were never merely passive victims but always maintained their humanity, culture and resistance.

### Decolonising the Curriculum

"Decolonising the curriculum" has become a significant discourse in education, though the term is often misunderstood. At its core, decolonising involves questioning the assumptions, categories and narratives that emerged from colonial power relations and continue to shape knowledge production.

For history teaching, this might involve:
- **Questioning Eurocentric periodisation**: The conventional division of history into Ancient, Medieval and Modern is derived from European experience and may not fit other parts of the world.
- **Recognising multiple modernities**: Understanding that modernity was not simply exported from Europe but took different forms in different contexts.
- **Centring other perspectives**: Examining historical events from the viewpoints of those outside Europe as well as from within.
- **Critiquing progress narratives**: Questioning assumptions that history moves inevitably toward Western-style development.

As the Political Studies Association notes, decolonising in its most basic sense means "learning history from a non-colonial view." This does not mean simply replacing one orthodoxy with another, but opening space for multiple perspectives and critical engagement.

## Curriculum Planning and Implementation

### Auditing Existing Provision

Before implementing changes, schools should audit their current curriculum to identify what diverse histories are already taught and where gaps exist. The Historical Association provides audit tools that help departments assess:
- Which groups are represented in the curriculum and which are absent?
- Do certain groups only appear in specific contexts (e.g., Black history only as slavery)?
- Is diversity integrated throughout or treated as a separate topic?
- What resources and CPD are needed to support diverse history teaching?

### Integrating vs. Separating

Schools face choices about whether to integrate diverse histories throughout the curriculum or teach them as distinct topics. Both approaches have advantages:

**Integration** ensures that diverse histories are treated as central to understanding British and world history, avoiding the impression that they are peripheral or supplementary. It enables pupils to make connections between different groups' experiences and to understand historical processes in their full complexity.

**Focused study** allows for depth of engagement with specific communities or experiences that might otherwise be lost in a broader narrative. It can provide space for topics that are otherwise squeezed out of crowded curricula.

Many successful curricula combine both approaches: integrating diverse perspectives throughout while also including focused studies of particular topics such as migration, empire or women's history.

### Staff Development and Support

Teaching diverse histories effectively requires subject knowledge that many teachers did not acquire during their own education or initial teacher training. Schools should provide:
- **Subject-specific CPD**: Opportunities to develop knowledge of unfamiliar topics
- **Resource sharing**: Systems for sharing effective resources and lesson plans within and between schools
- **External expertise**: Engagement with historians, community organisations and museums that can provide specialist input
- **Time for planning**: Recognition that developing new curriculum content requires significant investment of teacher time

The Historical Association, the Black Cultural Archives, the Runnymede Trust and other organisations provide training, resources and support for teachers seeking to diversify their history provision.

## Assessment and Progression

### Assessing Historical Thinking

Assessment in diverse history should focus on developing historical disciplinary skills rather than testing recall of marginalised figures. Effective assessment might evaluate pupils' ability to:
- Evaluate sources from different perspectives
- Construct arguments using diverse evidence
- Explain change and continuity across different groups
- Recognise how historical narratives are constructed
- Connect historical study to contemporary questions

The enquiry-based approach naturally supports this kind of assessment, with enquiries building toward substantial outcomes that require pupils to deploy knowledge and skills.

### Progression Across Key Stages

Diverse history should be planned across the key stages to ensure progression in both knowledge and understanding:

**Key Stage 1**: Pupils can encounter diversity through topics such as significant individuals from different backgrounds, changes within living memory that affected different communities, and local history that reveals migration and change.

**Key Stage 2**: Pupils can engage with longer narratives of diversity, such as migration over time, the ancient civilisations of the non-European world, and the experiences of different groups during key periods like the Victorian era or the Second World War.

**Key Stage 3**: Pupils can develop more sophisticated understanding of empire, slavery, migration and social change, engaging with multiple perspectives and contested interpretations.

**GCSE and A-Level**: Examination specifications increasingly offer options for studying diverse histories, including migration, empire and the non-European world.

## Challenges and Controversies

### Political Debates

Curriculum diversity has become a contested political issue, with debates about "British values," cultural identity and the teaching of empire generating significant controversy. Teachers may face pressure from various directions—some arguing that diverse histories undermine national cohesion, others that current provision remains inadequate.

The Historical Association and academic researchers have consistently argued that teaching honest, rigorous history—including the difficult aspects of Britain's past—strengthens rather than weakens citizenship and social cohesion. Understanding the historical roots of contemporary diversity enables informed debate about present challenges.

### Resource Limitations

Compared to established topics such as the Tudors or the World Wars, resources for teaching diverse histories may be less readily available. However, this situation is improving rapidly with organisations such as The Black Curriculum, the Runnymede Trust and the Historical Association developing extensive free resources. Digital archives and community museums also provide growing access
