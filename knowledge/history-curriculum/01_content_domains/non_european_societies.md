# Non-European Societies in the Primary History Curriculum

The study of non-European societies represents a crucial component of the Key Stage 2 history curriculum, offering pupils opportunities to understand the diversity of human civilisation beyond Europe and to develop more nuanced perspectives on historical development. Since the 2014 National Curriculum, primary schools have been required to teach "a non-European society that provides contrasts with British history," selecting from early Islamic civilisation (including Baghdad c. AD 900), Mayan civilisation (c. AD 900), or Benin in West Africa (c. AD 900-1300). This requirement reflects broader educational imperatives toward global understanding, decolonising perspectives, and challenging Eurocentric narratives that have traditionally dominated school history.

## The National Curriculum Requirement

### Statutory Framework

The Department for Education's history programmes of study (2013) specify that pupils should "know and understand significant aspects of the history of the wider world: the nature of ancient civilisations; the expansion and dissolution of empires; characteristic features of past non-European societies; achievements and follies of mankind." The non-European society study directly addresses these aims, ensuring pupils encounter sophisticated civilisations that developed independently of European influence.

The statutory requirement at Key Stage 2 specifies:

> "A non-European society that provides contrasts with British history – one study chosen from: early Islamic civilisation, including a study of Baghdad c. AD 900; Mayan civilization c. AD 900; Benin (West Africa) c. AD 900-1300."

This formulation is significant for several reasons. First, the requirement for contrast with British history encourages comparative thinking—pupils should understand these societies not merely as exotic alternatives but as contexts that illuminate distinctive features of British historical development. Second, the chronological anchor around c. AD 900 provides a rough synchronism, enabling pupils to connect these studies with their learning about Anglo-Saxon and Viking Britain. Third, the optional nature (schools choose one) acknowledges time constraints while ensuring all pupils encounter at least one major non-European civilisation in depth.

### Rationale and Educational Value

The inclusion of non-European societies responds to multiple educational imperatives recognised by Ofsted and the historical community:

**Global citizenship**: In an interconnected world, understanding diverse cultural traditions and historical trajectories is essential for responsible citizenship. The Historical Association's 2021 report on "Teaching Global History" emphasises that encounters with non-European pasts cultivate "historical empathy across cultural boundaries" and challenge assumptions about Western superiority.

**Countering Eurocentrism**: Traditional school history has often presented European civilisation as the primary engine of historical change, with non-European societies depicted as peripheral, primitive, or passive recipients of European influence. The non-European requirement explicitly disrupts this narrative, positioning Baghdad, Maya city-states, and Benin as centres of sophisticated cultural achievement.

**Diverse representation**: For pupils from heritage backgrounds connected to these societies, seeing their ancestors represented as historical agents with complex cultures supports identity and belonging. The 2023 Ofsted research review on history notes that "inclusive curriculum content enables pupils to see themselves in the past" and connects historical learning to pupils' lived experiences.

**Comparative historical thinking**: Studying societies that developed different solutions to universal human challenges—governance, agriculture, knowledge transmission, religious expression—develops pupils' capacity for comparison and contrast, a key second-order historical concept.

## Early Islamic Civilisation: Baghdad and the Golden Age

### Historical Context

The Abbasid Caliphate, established in 750 CE with its capital at Baghdad from 762, presided over what historians call the Islamic Golden Age—a period of remarkable cultural, scientific, and intellectual flourishing that lasted roughly from the eighth to thirteenth centuries. By c. AD 900, Baghdad had become perhaps the greatest city in the world, with a population estimated between 300,000 and 1,000,000, surpassing contemporary Constantinople and rivalling later medieval European cities.

The Abbasids represented a new dynasty following the Umayyads, claiming descent from Muhammad's uncle al-Abbas. Their revolution promised more inclusive governance, and indeed the Abbasid period saw conversion to Islam accelerate across the empire, which stretched from North Africa through the Middle East to Central Asia. Baghdad's location on the Tigris River made it a natural hub for trade routes connecting the Mediterranean, Indian Ocean, and Silk Road networks.

### The House of Wisdom (Bayt al-Hikma)

Central to Baghdad's intellectual significance was the Bayt al-Hikma, or House of Wisdom, established by Caliph al-Ma'mun in the early ninth century (though possibly originating as a library under his predecessor Harun al-Rashid). This institution exemplifies the Abbasid commitment to knowledge and learning:

**Translation movement**: The House of Wisdom sponsored systematic translation of Greek, Persian, Indian, and Syriac texts into Arabic. Scholars rendered works by Aristotle, Plato, Galen, Hippocrates, and numerous others into Arabic, preserving classical knowledge that would later influence European Renaissance learning. Hunayn ibn Ishaq, a Christian Arab scholar, translated over 100 texts and was reportedly paid in gold by the caliph—an indication of the value placed on intellectual labour.

**Original scholarship**: Beyond translation, the House of Wisdom supported original research across disciplines. Al-Khwarizmi developed algebra (the word derives from his text "al-Jabr") and introduced Hindu-Arabic numerals to the Islamic world. Al-Razi (Rhazes) wrote comprehensive medical encyclopaedias. Al-Kindi integrated Greek philosophy with Islamic theology. These scholars did not merely transmit knowledge but transformed it.

**Institutional model**: The House of Wisdom functioned as library, research academy, and university—a prototype for later European institutions. It hosted scholars from diverse religious and ethnic backgrounds: Muslims, Christians, Jews, and others collaborated in an atmosphere of relative intellectual freedom.

### Baghdad as a Cosmopolitan Centre

By c. 900, Baghdad presented a strikingly cosmopolitan character:

- **Population diversity**: Arabs, Persians, Turks, Kurds, and others lived alongside communities of Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, and others, all granted protected status (dhimmi) under Islamic law.
- **Urban planning**: The city was designed as a circular fortress-palace complex (the Round City), with the caliph's residence and main mosque at the centre, surrounded by residential quarters, markets, and gardens.
- **Economic vitality**: Baghdad's markets offered goods from across the known world—Chinese porcelain, Indian spices, African ivory, European amber—financed by sophisticated banking and credit systems.
- **Cultural production**: Poetry, music, and literature flourished. The "Thousand and One Nights" (Arabian Nights) draws upon this milieu, with stories reflecting Baghdad's cosmopolitan character.

### Pedagogical Approaches

When teaching early Islamic civilisation, effective practice involves:

**Connecting to prior knowledge**: Pupils should relate Baghdad to their understanding of Anglo-Saxon England (roughly contemporary), recognising that while Alfred the Great was consolidating Wessex, the Abbasid Caliphate presided over a vastly larger and more urbanised realm.

**Challenging stereotypes**: Many pupils arrive with media-influenced assumptions about Islam and the Middle East. Teaching about the House of Wisdom, scientific achievements, and cosmopolitan culture counters narratives that present Islamic societies as inherently backward or anti-intellectual.

**Source work**: Artefacts such as illuminated manuscripts, astrolabes, and architectural photographs provide concrete evidence of achievement. The BBC Teach video "Baghdad in 900AD" offers accessible visual material.

**Comparative thinking**: Teachers might ask: "How was Baghdad similar to and different from London today?" or "Why could the House of Wisdom develop in Baghdad but not in Anglo-Saxon England?" Such questions develop comparative reasoning while avoiding simplistic hierarchies.

## The Mayan Civilisation

### Geography and Chronology

The Maya civilisation developed in Mesoamerica (southern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and parts of Honduras and El Salvador) over three millennia. The so-called "Classic Period" (c. 250-900 CE) represents the height of Mayan urban civilisation, with the c. AD 900 anchor point coinciding with the mysterious collapse of many southern lowland cities—a topic that continues to fascinate archaeologists and pupils alike.

Unlike the Abbasid Caliphate's vast territorial empire, the Maya region comprised city-states (Tikal, Calakmul, Palenque, Copán, and many others) linked by shared culture, religion, and trade but politically independent. These city-states competed and allied in shifting patterns reminiscent of ancient Greek poleis or Italian Renaissance city-states.

### Achievements and Distinctive Features

**Architecture and urban planning**: Maya cities featured monumental architecture including pyramids, palaces, ball courts, and observatories. Tikal's Temple I rises 47 metres above the surrounding jungle, while Palenque's Temple of the Inscriptions contains the tomb of Pacal the Great—one of the most significant archaeological discoveries in the Americas. Cities were planned around ceremonial centres, with residential areas extending outward.

**Writing system**: The Maya developed one of only five independently created writing systems in human history (alongside Sumerian cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs, Chinese characters, and Indus script—though the latter remains undeciphered). Maya hieroglyphs combine logographic and syllabic elements, recording historical events, religious texts, and astronomical observations. Recent decades have seen dramatic breakthroughs in decipherment, revealing dynastic histories and political intrigue previously unknown.

**Mathematics and astronomy**: Maya mathematicians developed the concept of zero independently of Indian mathematicians (a rare achievement in human history) and used a vigesimal (base-20) system. Their astronomers calculated the solar year with remarkable accuracy and tracked Venus's cycles. The famous Long Count calendar enabled precise dating across centuries—a sophisticated response to the problem of time reckoning.

**Agriculture and environment**: Maya civilisation supported dense populations through sophisticated agriculture, including slash-and-burn (milpa) cultivation, raised fields in wetlands, and terrace systems in hilly terrain. The relationship between Maya societies and their tropical environment offers rich opportunities for exploring environmental history and sustainability.

### The Classic Maya Collapse

Around c. 900 CE, many southern lowland Maya cities were abandoned—a phenomenon known as the Classic Maya Collapse. This represents one of history's great mysteries and offers excellent opportunities for developing historical reasoning:

**Multiple hypotheses**: Archaeologists have proposed various explanations, including drought and climate change, overpopulation and environmental degradation, warfare between city-states, and political system breakdown. No single cause explains all cases, and different cities may have collapsed for different reasons.

**Evidence evaluation**: Teachers can present pupils with different types of evidence—lake sediment cores showing drought patterns, archaeological evidence of warfare, demographic estimates—and ask them to evaluate which explanations the evidence supports. This develops critical thinking about causation and evidence.

**Avoiding determinism**: It's important not to present the Maya as simply "disappearing"—Mayan peoples and culture continued (and continue) in the Yucatán and highland Guatemala. The "collapse" refers specifically to the abandonment of particular cities and the decline of Classic Period political structures.

### Pedagogical Approaches

The Maya offer distinctive opportunities for primary history teaching:

**Material culture**: The abundance of artefacts—pottery, jade carvings, painted ceramics, architectural remains—enables concrete engagement with the past. The Maya's distinctive artistic style, with its curvilinear forms and glyphic inscriptions, captures pupil imagination.

**Hands-on activities**: Creating Maya glyphs, calculating using the base-20 system, or building model pyramids provides experiential learning. The National Geographic Kids resources offer accessible visual materials.

**Ethical dimensions**: The treatment of Maya heritage raises important questions. Many artefacts were removed from Guatemala and Mexico during the colonial and post-colonial periods; discussions about repatriation and cultural heritage can develop pupils' ethical reasoning.

**Living legacy**: Unlike ancient civilisations that exist only in archaeological remains, Maya peoples maintain cultural continuity. Showing contemporary Maya communities (while being careful to avoid romanticising or primitivising) demonstrates that indigenous cultures survive and adapt.

## The Kingdom of Benin

### Historical Overview

The Kingdom of Benin (located in modern-day Nigeria, distinct from the modern Republic of Benin) represents one of West Africa's most sophisticated pre-colonial states. Founded in the twelfth century, Benin reached its territorial and cultural height between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries, with the c. AD 900-1300 anchor point capturing its formative period and early development.

The kingdom was centred on Benin City (Edo), strategically positioned in tropical rainforest some distance from the coast. Unlike the other non-European options, Benin maintained continuous existence into the modern period, only falling to British colonial forces in 1897—a date within living memory of oral historical transmission.

### Political Structure and the Oba

Benin's political system centred on the Oba (king), who combined spiritual, political, and judicial authority:

**Divine kingship**: The Oba was considered semi-divine, descended from the original kings who were children of the gods. This sacral authority enabled the Oba to command loyalty and maintain social order across a diverse kingdom.

**Bureaucratic administration**: Despite the Oba's paramount authority, Benin developed sophisticated administrative structures. Palace officials, titled chiefs, and district governors managed daily governance. The uzama (kingmakers) and eghaevbo (state councils) balanced monarchical power.

**Military organisation**: Benin maintained professional military forces including warriors, archers, and specialised units. The kingdom's armies expanded territory and protected trade routes. Unlike European feudal levies, Benin's forces represented state-controlled professional soldiers.

**Territorial extent**: At its height, Benin controlled territory extending from the Niger River delta to the coast and inland toward the Yoruba states, encompassing diverse ecological zones and ethnic groups within a unified political framework.

### The Benin Bronzes and Artistic Achievement

Benin's most celebrated cultural achievements are the brass castings known as the "Benin Bronzes" (though many are actually brass, with some ivory and wood):

**Technical sophistication**: Benin brass casters used the lost-wax (cire perdue) technique to create detailed plaques, busts, and sculptures. The craftsmanship rivals anything produced in contemporary Europe, demonstrating advanced metallurgical knowledge and artistic skill.

**Historical documentation**: The bronze plaques depict court life, historical events, and diplomatic encounters, providing visual primary sources for understanding Benin's history. Portuguese visitors from the late fifteenth century appear in bronzes, documenting early European-African contact from an African perspective.

**Cultural significance**: The bronzes served ceremonial purposes, honouring ancestors and legitimising the Oba's authority. Their creation and display reinforced social hierarchy and cultural values.

**Colonial violence and restitution**: In 1897, British forces attacked Benin City, burning the palace and looting thousands of artefacts including bronzes. These objects entered museums across Europe, primarily the British Museum. The ongoing controversy over their restitution—Nigeria has requested their return since independence—raises important questions about colonialism, cultural heritage, and historical justice that pupils can engage with age-appropriately.

### Trade and International Relations

Benin's economic prosperity derived from long-distance trade:

**Pre-European networks**: Before Portuguese arrival in the late fifteenth century, Benin traded with the interior (providing salt, European goods) and connected to trans-Saharan networks bringing North African and Middle Eastern goods.

**Atlantic commerce**: From the 1480s, Portuguese traders sought Benin's pepper, ivory, and eventually enslaved people. Benin maintained diplomatic relations with Portugal, exchanging ambassadors and establishing direct contact with European courts. The kingdom initially controlled this trade, dictating terms to European merchants rather than being dominated by them—a nuance important for understanding early modern Africa-Europe relations.

**Economic diversification**: Beyond trade, Benin agriculture supported dense populations. Palm oil production (which would become crucial in the nineteenth century) had traditional roots, while craft specialisation (textiles, woodcarving, ironworking) created economic complexity.

### Pedagogical Approaches

Teaching Benin effectively requires attention to several pedagogical considerations:

**Challenging "tribal" stereotypes**: Many pupils arrive with vague notions of "tribes" as primitive and disorganised. Benin's urban sophistication, bureaucratic government, and artistic achievements directly counter such assumptions.

**Centre the African perspective**: Unlike the other options where sources derive primarily from archaeology, Benin's history includes indigenous written and oral traditions alongside European accounts. The bronzes themselves represent African historical consciousness—Africans documenting their own history.

**Engage with difficult history**: The 1897 British invasion and continuing restitution debates introduce pupils to colonial violence and ongoing historical justice questions. The Historical Association's 2022 guidance on "Teaching Difficult History" suggests age-appropriate approaches to such topics, emphasising empathy, evidence-based reasoning, and connecting past injustice to present consequences.

**Local connections**: For schools with pupils of Nigerian or broader West African heritage, Benin offers opportunities for family and community knowledge to enter the classroom respectfully. However, teachers should avoid singling out pupils based on heritage or assuming all African-heritage pupils identify with West African history.

## Comparative Perspectives and Curriculum Choices

### Selecting Which Society to Teach

Schools must choose one non-European society, raising questions about selection criteria:

**Resources and expertise**: Schools with teachers knowledgeable about particular regions or with access to relevant museums (e.g., the British Museum's African collections for Benin) may reasonably prioritise those options.

**Pupil demographics**: Schools with significant numbers of Muslim pupils might prioritise Baghdad to validate those pupils' heritage; schools with African-Caribbean populations might prioritise Benin. However, such considerations should supplement rather than replace educational criteria—pupils benefit from learning about societies beyond their immediate heritage.

**Thematic coherence**: Teachers might select based on how well each option connects to other curriculum content. Baghdad connects to medieval Europe and the Crusades; the Maya to environmental history and geography; Benin to the transatlantic slave trade and empire.

**Available resources**: The quality and accessibility of teaching materials varies. The Maya have been widely taught in British schools since the 2014 curriculum, generating substantial resources. Benin materials have expanded considerably following curriculum inclusion and increased museum attention. Baghdad resources, while growing, may be less developed in some areas.

### Common Pupil Misconceptions

Teaching non-European societies requires explicit attention to misconceptions that pupils frequently hold:

**"They were primitive"**: Pupils may unconsciously assume that European societies were more "advanced" than their non-European contemporaries. Explicit comparison—showing that Baghdad c. 900 had plumbing, street lighting, and universities while Anglo-Saxon England did not—challenges such assumptions without denigrating European history.

**"They didn't change"**: The notion that non-European societies were static while Europe progressed represents a persistent misconception. Each of these societies underwent significant transformation: Baghdad's decline following the Mongol destruction of 1258, the Classic Maya Collapse, and Benin's evolution from forest polity to Atlantic trading power.

**"They were isolated"**: Pupils may imagine these societies as disconnected from wider worlds. In fact, all three participated in extensive trade networks—Baghdad as a hub of Afro-Eurasian commerce, Benin connected to trans-Saharan and Atlantic systems, the Maya linked through Mesoamerican exchange networks.

**"They disappeared"**: While the Maya city-states were abandoned, Maya peoples continued; Baghdad declined but remains a major city; Benin maintained continuity until 1897. Helping pupils distinguish between political transformations and cultural extinction develops more sophisticated historical understanding.

## Decolonising Approaches and Teaching Strategies

### Moving Beyond "Contribution" History

Eurocentric curricula often present non-European societies through "contribution" narratives—focusing on what they gave to Europe (Arabic numerals, the zero, chocolate) rather than understanding these societies on their own terms. Decolonising pedagogy requires shifting perspective:

**Internal narratives**: Present historical developments from the perspective of people within these societies. When discussing the House of Wisdom, emphasise what Abbasid scholars sought to achieve for their own intellectual traditions, not merely that they "preserved" Greek knowledge for Europe.

**Agency and complexity**: Show these societies as complex, internally diverse, and shaped by internal dynamics rather than merely responding to external forces. Benin's history cannot be reduced to its encounters with Europeans; the Maya collapse requires understanding Mesoamerican politics, not just environmental determinism.

**Critiquing civilisational hierarchies**: Avoid implicit or explicit ranking of societies as "advanced" or "backward." Instead, explore how different societies developed different solutions to shared problems, each with advantages and limitations.

### Addressing Sensitive Topics

Teaching non-European societies inevitably involves sensitive topics requiring careful handling:

**Human sacrifice**: Both Maya and Benin sources mention human sacrifice, which may disturb pupils or reinforce stereotypes about "primitive" practices. Contextualisation is essential—European contemporaries also practiced public execution and torture; religious rationales for sacrifice require respectful explanation without endorsement.

**Slavery**: Benin's involvement in the transatlantic slave trade and the Maya's practice of taking captives require nuanced treatment. Pupils should understand that slavery took different forms in different societies, and that the racialised chattel slavery of the Atlantic system represented a distinctive and particularly brutal form.

**Colonial violence**: The 1897 Benin Punitive Expedition involved massacre, looting, and destruction. The Historical Association recommends age-appropriate approaches: focusing on specific individuals whose lives were affected, using evidence to reconstruct what happened, and connecting historical violence to present-day debates about restitution.

### Practical Teaching Strategies

**Use of artefacts**: Objects provide concrete connections to past societies. Whether examining images of Benin bronzes, Maya pottery, or Islamic scientific instruments, encourage pupils to ask: "What can this object tell us?" "What can't it tell us?" "What questions do we still have?"

**Diverse sources**: Combine archaeological evidence, written texts (where available), and oral traditions. For Benin, the bronzes themselves constitute primary sources created by African artists; for Baghdad, contemporary accounts by travellers and scholars; for the Maya, deciphered hieroglyphic texts.

**Mapping exercises**: Have pupils map trade routes, city locations, or territorial extent. Visualising spatial relationships helps pupils understand connectivity and scale.

**Role play and simulation**: Carefully structured activities—such as simulating a Maya city-state council meeting or a Benin trading negotiation—can develop empathy and understanding of social structures. Such activities require careful framing to avoid trivialising or exoticising.

**Connecting to contemporary issues**: Drawing explicit connections between past and present—ongoing debates about Benin bronze restitution, the living Maya communities in Central America, the continuing significance of Baghdad in Iraqi history—demonstrates history's relevance to contemporary concerns.

## Assessment and Progression

### What Pupils Should Know and Understand

By the end of Key Stage 2, pupils studying a non-European society should be able to:

- Locate the society geographically and temporally, understanding its relationship to British history and other studied topics
- Describe key features of the society's social, political, and cultural organisation
- Identify and explain at least one significant achievement (intellectual, artistic, or technological)
- Use evidence to support claims about the past
- Identify similarities and differences between this society and other societies studied
- Recognise that historical narratives can be told from different perspectives

### Assessing Historical Thinking

Effective assessment goes beyond factual recall to evaluate historical understanding:

**Comparison tasks**: "How was the government of Benin similar to and different from Anglo-Saxon government?" Such questions assess whether pupils can identify relevant points of comparison and explain significance.

**Evidence evaluation**: Present pupils with conflicting accounts or incomplete evidence and ask them to suggest what further information would help answer a historical question.

**Perspective recognition**: "How might an Abbasid scholar and a Frankish monk have different views about the importance of translating Greek texts?" Questions like this assess understanding that historical actors had different knowledge, values, and concerns.

## Conclusion

The non-European society requirement represents a significant opportunity for primary history teaching. When taught effectively, these topics challenge Eurocentric assumptions, develop global awareness, and cultivate historical thinking through encounters with diverse ways of organising human societies. Whether schools choose Baghdad, the Maya, or Benin, the key lies in treating these societies with the same complexity and respect afforded to European topics—presenting them as dynamic, sophisticated civilisations shaped by intelligent agents making choices within particular circumstances.

The decolonising imperative that informs much contemporary educational discourse is not merely about "adding" non-European content to an unchanged curriculum, but about transforming how history is conceived and taught. The non-European requirement, properly implemented, contributes to this transformation—helping pupils understand that human achievement and historical significance are not European monopolies, but characteristics of diverse civilisations across time and space.

For teachers, success requires adequate subject knowledge, sensitive pedagogical approaches, and willingness to engage with difficult histories. The resources and scholarly community available to support this teaching have expanded considerably since the 2014 curriculum's introduction, making high-quality non-European history teaching increasingly achievable for all primary schools.
