# Britain 1745–1901: Ideas, Political Power, Industry and Empire

## Overview and National Curriculum Context

The study of Britain between 1745 and 1901 forms a statutory unit within the Key Stage 3 National Curriculum for history, appearing under the heading "ideas, political power, industry and empire: Britain, 1745-1901" (Department for Education, 2013). This period encompasses transformative developments that fundamentally reshaped British society, economy, governance, and global position. The National Curriculum non-statutory guidance suggests this unit might include: the Enlightenment in Europe and Britain with links back to 17th-century thinkers and scientists and the founding of the Royal Society; the agricultural revolution; the industrial revolution; the development of the British Empire; and campaigns for social justice and political reform.

This era represents what the Historical Association describes as "a pivotal moment in human history"—the transformation of England from a rural, agricultural country to an urban, industrialised one (Historical Association, 2023). The period witnessed massive dislocation and radically altered the nature of society, making it essential that pupils understand not merely a sequence of inventions and reforms, but the profound interconnections between intellectual, economic, social, and political change.

## The Intellectual Foundations: The Enlightenment and Scientific Revolution

### The Enlightenment in Britain

The Enlightenment, or Age of Reason, began in Europe between the 17th and 18th centuries and fundamentally altered people's attitudes towards politics, science, economics, and society (Historic UK, 2023). In Britain, the Enlightenment built upon earlier scientific developments while developing distinctive characteristics rooted in empirical observation, practical application, and gradual reform rather than revolutionary upheaval.

Key British Enlightenment thinkers included:

**John Locke (1632–1704)**, whose ideas about natural rights, government by consent, and the separation of powers influenced political developments throughout the period. Locke's concept that government required the consent of the governed provided intellectual foundations for later constitutional developments.

**David Hume (1711–1776)**, whose sceptical empiricism challenged prevailing assumptions about causation, religion, and human nature. Hume's work exemplified the Enlightenment commitment to subjecting received wisdom to rational scrutiny.

**Adam Smith (1723–1790)**, whose *Wealth of Nations* (1776) articulated the principles of free-market economics that would shape British economic policy and industrial development. Smith's concept of the "invisible hand" of market forces provided an intellectual framework for understanding the emerging industrial economy.

### The Royal Society and Institutional Science

The Royal Society of London for Promoting Natural Knowledge, established in 1660 and granted a royal charter by Charles II in 1662, served as the premier scientific body in Britain (Royal Society, 2024). As the world's oldest national scientific society, it played a crucial role in institutionalising scientific enquiry and establishing the norms of empirical investigation, peer review, and public dissemination of knowledge that characterise modern science.

The Society's motto—*Nullius in verba* (Take nobody's word for it)—encapsulated the empirical spirit of the scientific revolution. Key figures associated with the Royal Society during this period include:

**Isaac Newton (1643–1727)**, whose *Principia Mathematica* (1687) established the laws of motion and universal gravitation, providing a mathematical framework for understanding the physical universe that would remain authoritative for centuries.

**Joseph Banks (1743–1820)**, who as President of the Royal Society from 1778 until his death, presided over British science during a period of explosive growth and directed scientific attention toward the practical challenges of empire and industry.

**Humphry Davy (1778–1829)** and **Michael Faraday (1791–1867)**, whose chemical and electrical researches at the Royal Institution demonstrated the practical applications of scientific knowledge to industrial processes.

## The Agricultural Revolution

### Changes in Farming Practice

The period 1745–1901 witnessed profound transformations in British agriculture that both enabled and responded to industrialisation. These changes included:

**Enclosure**: The consolidation of scattered strips into compact fields, legally formalised through Parliamentary Enclosure Acts (particularly 1750–1850), transformed the landscape and social structure of rural England. While enclosure increased agricultural efficiency, it displaced many small farmers and cottagers, contributing to the supply of labour for industrial towns.

**Technological Innovation**: New farming implements including Jethro Tull's seed drill (1701), the Rotherham plough, and later mechanised reapers increased productivity. The four-field crop rotation system (wheat-turnips-barley-clover) replaced the medieval three-field system, improving soil fertility and enabling year-round livestock husbandry.

**Selective Breeding**: Pioneered by Robert Bakewell (1725–1795) and others, systematic selective breeding of livestock dramatically improved yields of meat, wool, and dairy products. Bakewell's Dishley Leicester sheep and Longhorn cattle demonstrated how scientific principles could be applied to agriculture.

### Consequences of Agricultural Change

The agricultural revolution produced several interconnected consequences that pupils should understand:

**Population Growth**: Increased food production supported a population that grew from approximately 6 million in 1750 to over 30 million by 1901. This growing population provided both the workforce for industry and the domestic market for manufactured goods.

**Rural Depopulation**: As farming became more capital-intensive and less labour-intensive, many rural workers migrated to towns and cities in search of employment. This migration pattern established the urban-rural demographic balance that characterises modern Britain.

**Social Stratification**: The agricultural revolution accelerated the differentiation between wealthy capitalist farmers, struggling smallholders, and landless labourers—a social hierarchy that would shape rural politics throughout the 19th century.

## The Industrial Revolution

### The Nature of Industrial Transformation

The Industrial Revolution represents what the Core Knowledge Foundation describes as "a sweeping transformation in how people worked and lived" (Core Knowledge, 2024). Beginning in Britain in the 1760s–1830s and subsequently spreading to Europe and North America, this revolution lured people away from the land to factories and cities in massive numbers, fundamentally altering human existence.

Key characteristics of the Industrial Revolution include:

**Mechanisation**: The substitution of machine power for human and animal labour, exemplified by the spinning jenny (1764), water frame (1769), spinning mule (1779), and power loom (1785) in textiles; and by steam engines, blast furnaces, and rolling mills in metallurgy.

**Factory System**: The concentration of workers in large-scale production facilities under centralised supervision, replacing the domestic system of cottage industry. This transformation changed not only how goods were produced but how workers experienced time, space, and social relationships.

**Steam Power**: James Watt's improvements to the steam engine (1769–1784) provided a portable, reliable power source that could be applied to manufacturing, mining, and transport. Steam power liberated industry from dependence on watercourses and facilitated the concentration of production in towns.

**Iron and Coal**: The shift from charcoal to coke in iron smelting (perfected by Abraham Darby at Coalbrookdale, 1709) and the development of puddling and rolling techniques (Henry Cort, 1784) made Britain the world's leading iron producer. Coal mining expanded to fuel steam engines, iron furnaces, and domestic heating.

### Transport Revolution

The Industrial Revolution required and enabled dramatic improvements in transport infrastructure:

**Canals**: The "canal age" (c. 1760–1830), initiated by the Duke of Bridgewater's canal (1759–1761), provided efficient bulk transport for heavy goods. Engineers such as James Brindley, Thomas Telford, and John Rennie created a network connecting industrial regions to ports and markets.

**Turnpike Roads**: Improved road surfaces engineered by John Metcalf, Thomas Telford, and John McAdam enabled faster, more reliable coaching services and facilitated the distribution of manufactured goods.

**Railways**: The railway era, inaugurated by the Stockton and Darlington Railway (1825) and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (1830), transformed both freight and passenger transport. By 1850, over 6,000 miles of track crisscrossed Britain; by 1900, the network exceeded 18,000 miles. Railways standardised time (leading to the adoption of Greenwich Mean Time nationwide in 1880), enabled commuter suburbs, and created new patterns of leisure and tourism.

### Industrialisation and Society

The social consequences of industrialisation were profound and controversial:

**Urbanisation**: Towns such as Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, and Sheffield grew from modest market centres to industrial metropolises. Manchester's population increased from 25,000 in 1772 to over 300,000 by 1851. This rapid, unplanned growth created unprecedented problems of housing, sanitation, and public health.

**Working Conditions**: Factory work imposed new disciplines of time, motion, and supervision. Working hours were long (commonly 12–14 hours daily), child labour was extensive, and industrial accidents were frequent. The factory system replaced the seasonal rhythms of agricultural labour with the regular, machine-paced routine of industrial production.

**Living Conditions**: Industrial towns developed densely packed housing—back-to-back terraces, cellar dwellings, and tenements—with inadequate sanitation, contaminated water supplies, and high mortality rates. Chadwick's *Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population* (1842) documented these conditions and stimulated public health reforms.

**Standards of Living**: Historians debate whether real wages rose or fell during the early Industrial Revolution. The "optimist" position, associated with R.M. Hartwell and others, argues that industrialisation eventually raised living standards; the "pessimist" position, associated with E.P. Thompson and others, emphasises the qualitative losses in autonomy, skill, and community that accompanied industrial employment. As Thinking History notes, pupils need a baseline understanding of pre-industrial living standards to evaluate such claims (Thinking History, 2024).

## Political Power and Constitutional Development

### The Legacy of 1688 and the Hanoverian Succession

The period opened in 1745 with the final Jacobite rising, an attempted restoration of the Stuart monarchy that ended decisively at the Battle of Culloden (1746). The failure of the '45 confirmed the Hanoverian succession and the dominance of parliamentary institutions over dynastic claims.

The Glorious Revolution of 1688 had established key principles that developed during this period:

**Parliamentary Sovereignty**: The supremacy of statute law over royal prerogative, confirmed by the Bill of Rights (1689) and the Act of Settlement (1701), became increasingly entrenched as customary practice.

**Cabinet Government**: The emergence of the Cabinet as the effective executive, responsible to Parliament rather than the monarch, developed gradually through the 18th century. The appointment of Robert Walpole as First Lord of the Treasury (1721–1742) is often taken as marking the emergence of prime ministerial government.

**Party Politics**: The Whig and Tory parties, originally factions supporting different dynastic claims, evolved into organised political parties competing for parliamentary majorities and ministerial office.

### Reform and Democratisation

The period witnessed gradual extension of political participation and reform of institutions:

**The Reform Act 1832**: Responding to pressure from the political unions and the threat of revolutionary upheaval (the "Days of May" 1832), the Whig government secured passage of the Great Reform Act. This measure abolished "rotten boroughs," redistributed seats to growing industrial towns, and extended the franchise to the middle classes. Though limited in immediate impact, it established the principle that the constitution could be peacefully reformed.

**The Chartist Movement**: The People's Charter (1838) demanded universal male suffrage, annual parliaments, equal constituencies, payment of MPs, abolition of property qualifications, and the secret ballot. Though Chartism failed to achieve its immediate objectives, its demands were gradually realised over subsequent decades.

**Further Reform Acts**: The Reform Acts of 1867 (Disraeli) and 1884 (Gladstone) progressively extended the franchise. By 1885, approximately 60% of adult males could vote; by 1918, universal adult suffrage was achieved.

**The Role of Women**: Women were explicitly excluded from the franchise by the 1832 Act (the first time such exclusion had been statutory). The women's suffrage movement, developing from the 1860s and intensifying after 1903 with the formation of the Women's Social and Political Union, campaigned for political equality. Partial success came in 1918; equal franchise was achieved in 1928.

### The Growth of the State

The period saw significant expansion of government functions:

**Law and Order**: The professionalisation of policing, beginning with the Metropolitan Police Act (1829) and extending to borough and county forces, replaced informal systems of constables and watchmen. The prison system was reformed along penitentiary lines, influenced by Benthamite utilitarianism.

**Poor Relief**: The Poor Law Amendment Act (1834) reorganised poor relief on the "less eligibility" principle, establishing workhouses as deterrent institutions. The distinction between the "deserving" and "undeserving" poor shaped welfare provision for generations.

**Public Health**: The Public Health Act (1848) and subsequent legislation established local boards of health, sanitary inspectors, and building regulations. The germ theory of disease, accepted from the 1880s, provided scientific foundations for public health measures.

**Education**: State intervention in education grew gradually: the monitorial and Lancasterian schools of the early 19th century; the Factory Acts requiring factory children to attend school; the grant system for denominational schools (1833 onwards); and eventually the Elementary Education Acts (1870, 1876, 1880) establishing universal, compulsory, secular elementary education.

## The British Empire

### Expansion and Consolidation

The period 1745–1901 witnessed the transformation of Britain from a significant European power to the world's leading imperial nation. This expansion occurred through multiple mechanisms:

**Conquest and Annexation**: Territorial acquisition through military conquest, exemplified by the conquest of Bengal after Plassey (1757), the defeat of Mysore and the Marathas in India, the acquisition of Cape Colony (1795, confirmed 1814), and the expansion of settler colonies in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.

**Settlement**: The establishment of settler colonies in North America (though the thirteen colonies were lost in 1783), Australia (from 1788), New Zealand (Treaty of Waitangi, 1840), and Canada (responsible government granted 1848). These colonies received substantial British immigration and developed self-governing institutions.

**Trade and Informal Empire**: The establishment of commercial dominance in regions not formally annexed, particularly Latin America (after independence c. 1820) and China (following the Opium Wars and Treaty of Nanking, 1842). British capital, shipping, and manufactured goods dominated these markets.

**The "Scramble for Africa"**: The late 19th-century partition of Africa, formalised at the Berlin Conference (1884–1885), added vast African territories to the British Empire. By 1901, British control extended from Egypt to Cape Colony across eastern Africa, and included substantial West African possessions.

### Imperial Ideologies

British imperialism was justified and contested through various ideological frameworks:

**Mercantilism**: The 18th-century view that colonies existed for the benefit of the mother country, providing raw materials and markets for manufactures. This perspective was challenged by Adam Smith's free-trade arguments and gradually supplanted by laissez-faire approaches.

**The "Civilising Mission"**: The Victorian belief that British rule brought progress—Christianity, commerce, and civilisation—to "backward" peoples. This paternalistic ideology justified intervention and annexation while occluding exploitation and violence.

**Racism and Scientific Racism**: Theories of racial hierarchy, developing from the 1850s and given pseudo-scientific respectability by writers such as Robert Knox and later social Darwinists, provided ideological foundations for imperial domination.

**Anti-Imperialism**: Significant opposition to empire existed throughout the period, from the radical critics of the 18th century (Burke on Warren Hastings, the Rockingham Whigs on America) to the Little Englanders of the mid-19th century (Cobden, Bright) to the humanitarian critics of the "Scramble for Africa."

### Imperial Economics

The empire's economic significance evolved during this period:

**The Old Colonial System**: Before 1846, protected markets in the American and West Indian colonies, enforced by the Navigation Acts, provided guaranteed markets for British exports and sources of strategic materials.

**Free Trade Imperialism**: The repeal of the Corn Laws (1846) and Navigation Acts (1849) marked a shift to free trade. Britain became "the workshop of the world," exporting manufactured goods and importing raw materials and foodstuffs from across the globe.

**Imperialism of Free Trade**: The mid-Victorian period saw British hegemony maintained through commercial and naval supremacy rather than formal territorial control. The Royal Navy guaranteed freedom of the seas; the gold standard (formally adopted 1821, fully operational by 1870s) provided international monetary stability; and British capital financed infrastructure development worldwide.

**New Imperialism**: From the 1880s, formal empire regained importance. The empire provided markets for surplus capital investment, sources of raw materials (particularly for the new electrical and chemical industries), and opportunities for emigration.

## Social Movements and Reform

### The Campaign Against Slavery

The abolition of the slave trade (1807) and slavery itself (1833) represented significant humanitarian achievements:

**The Abolitionist Movement**: Led by William Wilberforce, Thomas Clarkson, and the Quaker community, the campaign against the slave trade combined moral argument, economic analysis, and mass mobilisation. The boycott of slave-produced sugar, the distribution of medallions bearing the image of a kneeling slave with the motto "Am I not a man and a brother?", and the presentation of evidence from former slaves built public pressure for abolition.

**Emancipation**: The Slavery Abolition Act (1833) emancipated enslaved people throughout the British Empire, though with a system of "apprenticeship" that delayed full freedom until 1838. The government paid £20 million in compensation to slave-owners—representing approximately 40% of government expenditure—while the formerly enslaved received nothing.

**Limitations**: Abolition within the British Empire did not prevent British merchants and manufacturers from benefiting from slave-produced commodities (particularly cotton from the American South) or from participating in the slave trades of other nations.

### Labour and Trade Unionism

The period saw the emergence of organised labour movements:

**Combination Acts and Their Repeal**: The Combination Acts (1799–1800), passed in response to fears of revolutionary contagion, prohibited trade unions. Their repeal (1824–1825) legalised collective bargaining, though with significant restrictions.

**The Tolpuddle Martyrs**: The prosecution of agricultural labourers from Tolpuddle, Dorset, in 1834 for administering unlawful oaths highlighted continuing legal vulnerabilities. The subsequent pardon, following massive public petitioning, demonstrated growing support for labour organisation.

**New Model Unionism**: From the 1850s, skilled craft unions such as the Amalgamated Society of Engineers adopted respectability, centralisation, and provision of friendly benefits. These "new model" unions rejected radical politics in favour of pragmatic bargaining.

**The Rise of New Unionism**: From the 1880s, organisation spread to unskilled and semi-skilled workers—the "matchgirls" (1888), the London dockers (1889). The strikes of this period demonstrated the power of solidarity across occupational boundaries.

**The Labour Party**: The formation of the Labour Representation Committee (1900), following the Taff Vale decision (1901) which made unions liable for strike losses, established independent political representation for labour. By 1906, this had become the Labour Party.

### Women's Rights and Social Reform

Beyond the suffrage campaign, women contributed to and led various reform movements:

**Education**: Campaigners including Emily Davies, Barbara Bodichon, and Anne Jemima Clough established schools and colleges providing academic education for girls and women. Girton College, Cambridge (1869) and Newnham College (1871) pioneered higher education for women, though full membership of Cambridge University was not achieved until 1948.

**Marriage and Property**: The Married Women's Property Acts (1870, 1882) gradually established married women's right to own property independently of their husbands. The Matrimonial Causes Act (1857) transferred jurisdiction over divorce from ecclesiastical to civil courts.

**Social Purity and Temperance**: Women played prominent roles in movements for social purity, temperance, and moral reform. Josephine Butler's campaign against the Contagious Diseases Acts (repealed 1886) challenged the double standard of sexual morality.

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Teaching the Industrial Revolution

The Historical Association and other professional bodies offer guidance on effective pedagogy for this period:

**Avoiding Telegraphic Narratives**: Rather than treating the Industrial Revolution as a list of inventions (the spinning jenny, the water frame, the steam engine), effective teaching emphasises the interconnected nature of economic, social, and political change. The Thinking History website advises that pupils need to understand pre-industrial living standards before they can evaluate claims about improvement or deterioration (Thinking History, 2024).

**Using Local History**: The Industrial Revolution offers rich opportunities for local history investigation. Most regions of Britain contain evidence of industrial development—mills, canals, railway viaducts, workers' housing—that can make abstract national narratives concrete and particular.

**Handling Evidence**: The period provides abundant primary sources suitable for classroom use: parliamentary reports (particularly the Factory Commission reports and Chadwick's Sanitary Report), visual sources (engravings, paintings, photographs from the later period), and literary sources (Dickens, Gaskell, Engels). These sources can be used to develop pupils' skills in evaluating provenance, handling bias, and constructing arguments.

**Continuity and Change**: Effective teaching addresses both the dramatic nature of change and significant continuities. While industrialisation transformed much of British life, many aspects of social structure, political power, and cultural practice persisted or adapted rather than disappearing.

**Significance**: Pupils should consider why this period matters—how the developments of 1745–1901 shaped the Britain they inhabit today. Questions of significance connect historical study to contemporary concerns about inequality, environmental degradation, urban life, and globalisation.

### Progression Across Key Stages

**Key Stage 2**: Pupils may encounter aspects of Victorian Britain through thematic study (e.g., "a significant turning point in British history" or "a study of an aspect or theme in British history that extends chronological knowledge beyond 1066"). Topics might include the lives of children in Victorian Britain, the development of transport (Brunel and the railways), or the achievements of Victorian engineers and reformers.

**Key Stage 3**: The National Curriculum specifies the study of "ideas, political power, industry and empire: Britain, 1745-1901" as a statutory unit. This should provide comprehensive coverage of the developments outlined above, with attention to the interconnections between intellectual, economic, political, and imperial change.

**GCSE**: Examination specifications offer various options for studying this period, typically including thematic studies (e.g., migration, empire, power and the people) and depth studies (e.g., Britain 1745-c.1900). The period provides abundant material for developing the analytical and evaluative skills required at this level.

## Common Misconceptions

Teachers should be alert to common misconceptions pupils hold about this period:

**The Industrial Revolution as Sudden Change**: Pupils often imagine the Industrial Revolution as a sudden, dramatic transformation. In fact, industrialisation was a gradual process extending over many decades, with significant regional and sectoral variation. Many areas of Britain remained predominantly agricultural throughout the period.

**Universal Urban Squalor**: While urban conditions in rapidly growing industrial towns were often appalling, this was not universal. Some industrial towns (Saltaire, Bournville) were purpose-built with worker welfare in mind. Moreover, the period also saw the construction of elegant terraces, squares, and suburbs for the prosperous middle classes.

**The Steam Engine as Cause Rather Than Consequence**: Pupils often attribute the Industrial Revolution to the invention of the steam engine. In fact, steam power was one element in a complex process of change, and its widespread application came relatively late. Water power remained significant throughout the period, and many industries (notably pottery, glass, and chemicals) developed without heavy mechanism.

**Empire as Uncontested**: The British Empire is often presented as an unproblematic achievement. In fact, empire was always contested—by colonised peoples, by domestic critics, and by rival powers. Pupils should understand empire as a site of conflict, negotiation, and resistance as well as domination.

**Progress as Inevitable**: The reforms of the period—parliamentary reform, factory legislation, public health measures—can appear as inevitable responses to obvious problems. In fact, reform was hard-won, often delayed, and rarely comprehensive. Understanding the obstacles to reform helps pupils appreciate the significance of achievements.
