# Anglo-Saxon and Viking Britain

## Overview and Statutory Context

Anglo-Saxon and Viking Britain represents a foundational topic within the Key Stage 2 history National Curriculum, spanning two statutory study units: "Britain's settlement by Anglo-Saxons and Scots" and "The Viking and Anglo-Saxon struggle for the Kingdom of England to the time of Edward the Confessor." This period, from approximately AD 410 to 1066, covers more than six centuries of profound cultural, political, and social transformation.

The Department for Education (DfE, 2013) specifies that pupils should study the Roman withdrawal from Britain around AD 410, the subsequent Anglo-Saxon invasions and settlements, the establishment of kingdoms, and the later Viking raids and invasions. This period culminates with the death of Edward the Confessor in 1066, which serves as the traditional endpoint before the Norman Conquest.

This topic offers rich opportunities for developing pupils' chronological understanding, substantive knowledge of invasion and settlement patterns, and disciplinary thinking about cause, consequence, continuity, and change. The Historical Association (n.d.) identifies this as "the most formative period in British history," during which the foundations of modern England were established through successive waves of migration, conflict, and cultural synthesis.

## The Anglo-Saxon Settlement and Kingdoms

### Roman Withdrawal and the Adventus Saxonum

The traditional narrative holds that Roman forces withdrew from Britain around AD 410 to defend other parts of the crumbling Western Roman Empire. However, recent archaeological and historical scholarship complicates this picture. Rather than a sudden vacuum of power, the transition was likely more gradual, with Romanised Britons maintaining administrative structures for decades while facing increasing pressure from Pictish raiders from the north and Irish settlers (the Scotti) from the west.

The Anglo-Saxon migrations—traditionally termed the Adventus Saxonum (Coming of the Saxons)—began in the mid-fifth century and continued for over a century. According to the Venerable Bede, writing in the eighth century, three main groups arrived: the Angles (from modern-day Denmark and northern Germany), the Saxons (from the North Sea coast of Germany), and the Jutes (from the Jutland peninsula). Archaeological evidence suggests additional contributions from Frisians and other Germanic peoples.

These migrations were not initially organised invasions but rather movements of warbands, settlers, and mercenaries. The famous legend of Hengist and Horsa, invited by the British leader Vortigern to fight the Picts, reflects the tradition of Germanic mercenary service in late Roman Britain—though the historicity of this specific story remains debated among historians.

### The Heptarchy and the Emergence of Kingdoms

By the sixth and seventh centuries, Anglo-Saxon settlement had crystallised into a patchwork of competing kingdoms, traditionally known as the Heptarchy (Seven Kingdoms), though the number fluctuated. The major kingdoms included:

**Kent** in the southeast, traditionally founded by Jutish settlers. Kent maintained close contacts with Frankish Gaul and was the first kingdom to convert to Christianity under King Æthelberht.

**Wessex** (West Saxons) in the southwest, which would eventually rise to dominance under Alfred the Great and his successors. The kingdom traced its origins to Cerdic and Cynric, though the earliest genealogies blend history and legend.

**Essex** (East Saxons) and **Sussex** (South Saxons) represent smaller kingdoms that were eventually absorbed by their more powerful neighbours.

**East Anglia**, the kingdom of the East Angles, which produced the famous ship burial at Sutton Hoo and the martyred King Edmund.

**Mercia** in the Midlands, which rose to dominance under kings such as Penda, Wulfhere, and Offa. Mercia controlled vast territories and established the boundary with Welsh kingdoms along Offa's Dyke.

**Northumbria**, formed from the union of Bernicia and Deira, which became a centre of learning and culture during the seventh century, producing scholars such as Bede and the illuminated manuscripts of Lindisfarne.

These kingdoms were not fixed entities but fluctuated in power and territory. The concept of a single English identity emerged only gradually, and regional identities remained strong throughout the Anglo-Saxon period.

### Place Names and Evidence of Settlement

One of the most enduring legacies of Anglo-Saxon settlement is the transformation of Britain's place name landscape. The distribution of Anglo-Saxon place names provides archaeologists and historians with valuable evidence about the patterns and density of settlement.

Common Old English place name elements include:

- **-ton** or **-tun** (farmstead, enclosure, village): Northampton, Taunton, Luton
- **-ham** (homestead, village): Birmingham, Nottingham, Tottenham
- **-bury** or **-borough** (fortified place): Shrewsbury, Peterborough, Scarborough
- **-ford** (river crossing): Oxford, Hereford, Watford
- **-field** (open land, cleared land): Sheffield, Huddersfield
- **-worth** (enclosure): Tamworth, Kenilworth

Place names with Celtic (British/Welsh) elements often survived in areas where Anglo-Saxon settlement was less dense, particularly in the west and north. The pattern of Anglo-Saxon versus Celtic place names provides a rough map of settlement density and cultural dominance.

Topographical names indicating Anglo-Saxon settlement include:
- **-ley** or **-leigh** (clearing, meadow): Barnsley, Dudley
- **-hurst** (wooded hill): Ockhurst, Lyndhurst
- **-den** or **-don** (hill, down): Croydon, Wimbledon

Teaching pupils to identify these place name elements in their local area offers a tangible connection to the Anglo-Saxon past and demonstrates how historical evidence surrounds us in everyday life.

### Anglo-Saxon Culture and Society

Anglo-Saxon society was hierarchical, though the bonds of kinship and lordship created complex webs of obligation and loyalty. At the top stood the king (cyning), supported by ealdormen and thegns who administered territories and raised the fyrd (militia). The majority of the population comprised ceorls (freemen farmers), with enslaved people (theows) at the bottom of the social order.

The Anglo-Saxons brought with them their Germanic language, which evolved into Old English—the direct ancestor of modern English. Despite the eventual dominance of English, Celtic languages survived in western areas, and Latin remained the language of the Church and scholarship.

Anglo-Saxon material culture is exemplified by the spectacular finds from Sutton Hoo (Suffolk), where a ship burial containing exquisite metalwork, weapons, and jewellery was discovered in 1939. The Sutton Hoo helmet, with its distinctive face-mask, has become an iconic symbol of Anglo-Saxon craftsmanship. The Staffordshire Hoard, discovered in 2009, further demonstrates the wealth and artistic sophistication of Anglo-Saxon metalworkers.

## The Viking Age in Britain

### Raiders, Traders, and Settlers

The Viking Age in Britain traditionally begins with the raid on Lindisfarne (Holy Island) in AD 793. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recorded that "on 8 June, the ravages of heathen men miserably destroyed God's church on Lindisfarne, with plunder and slaughter." This dramatic attack on one of England's most sacred sites shocked contemporaries and marked the beginning of two and a half centuries of Scandinavian involvement in British affairs.

However, the Viking presence in Britain was far more complex than simple raiding. Scandinavians came as traders, explorers, mercenaries, and settlers as well as warriors. The term "Viking" itself is problematic—it may derive from Old Norse víkingr (pirate, raider) or refer to the vík (bay, inlet) from which they sailed. Not all Scandinavians were Vikings, and not all Vikings were raiders.

The initial raids of the late eighth and early ninth centuries targeted wealthy monasteries and coastal settlements. The monasteries made attractive targets because they combined concentrated wealth (in the form of precious metalwork and manuscripts) with limited defences. Raids gradually escalated into larger expeditions, with Viking forces over-wintering in England and establishing temporary bases.

### The Great Heathen Army and the Conquest of the Kingdoms

In 865, a "Great Heathen Army" (mycel hæþen here) arrived in East Anglia, signalling a new phase in Viking activity. Unlike previous raiding parties, this was a substantial force capable of conquering and occupying entire kingdoms. Led initially by the sons of the legendary Ragnar Lothbrok—Ivar the Boneless, Halfdan, and Ubba—the army conquered Northumbria (killing King Ælla, allegedly by the "blood eagle"), East Anglia (where King Edmund was martyred), and much of Mercia.

Only Wessex, under the leadership of Alfred and his brother King Æthelred, resisted the onslaught. By 878, the Vikings controlled nearly all of eastern and northern England, with Alfred reduced to a fugitive in the Somerset marshes. The famous legend of Alfred burning the cakes dates from this period of hiding and regrouping.

### Alfred the Great and the Birth of England

Alfred's recovery from the nadir of 878 represents one of the most remarkable turnarounds in English history. After gathering forces in the Somerset Levels (traditionally at Athelney), Alfred defeated the Viking army at the Battle of Edington (878). The subsequent Treaty of Wedmore established a boundary between Alfred's Wessex and Viking-controlled territory.

This boundary ran roughly from Chester to London, with the area north and east becoming known as the Danelaw—the area under Danish law and custom. The Danelaw was not a unified state but a collection of territories where Scandinavian settlement was concentrated. Within the Danelaw, Norse laws, customs, and language influenced local administration and culture.

Alfred's achievements extended beyond military success. He established a system of fortified towns (burhs) across his kingdom, creating defensible strongpoints that could resist Viking incursions. He reformed the coinage, issued a legal code, and promoted education in English. His translations of important Latin texts (including works by Pope Gregory the Great and Boethius) helped establish Old English as a literary and scholarly language.

Perhaps most significantly, Alfred began the process of creating a unified English identity. His successors—Edward the Elder, Æthelstan, and Edmund—gradually expanded West Saxon control over the Danelaw and the other English kingdoms. By the mid-tenth century, a single kingdom of the English had emerged, with kings who styled themselves "King of the English" (Rex Anglorum) or even "King of Britain" (Rex Totius Britanniae).

### The Danelaw and Scandinavian Settlement

The Danelaw represents one of the most significant migrations in British history, comparable in scale to the original Anglo-Saxon settlement. Scandinavian place names in eastern and northern England reveal the extent of settlement, with Norse elements including:

- **-by** (farmstead, village): Grimsby, Whitby, Derby
- **-thorpe** (outlying farm): Scunthorpe, Mablethorpe
- **-thwaite** (clearing): Braithwaite, Slaithwaite
- **-kirk** (church): Ormskirk, Falkirk
- **-dale** (valley): Rochdale, Clydesdale

The density of Scandinavian place names is highest in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, and the East Midlands, suggesting these areas received the heaviest settlement. Unlike the Anglo-Saxons, who largely replaced or absorbed the existing population in lowland areas, the Viking settlers often established themselves in marginal areas or alongside existing communities.

Archaeological evidence from York (Jorvik), the greatest Viking city in Britain, reveals a cosmopolitan settlement engaged in international trade. The Coppergate excavations uncovered workshops producing everything from jewellery to combs, while the Jorvik Viking Centre recreates the sights, sounds, and even smells of tenth-century York.

### Later Viking Period and the Road to 1066

The period after Alfred saw fluctuating fortunes in the struggle between English and Scandinavian forces. Æthelstan's victory at Brunanburh (937) defeated a coalition of Norse, Scots, and Strathclyde Welsh, establishing English dominance. However, renewed Viking attacks in the late tenth century—particularly during the reign of Æthelred "the Unready"—weakened the kingdom.

Æthelred's reign was marked by a policy of paying Danegeld—tribute money to buy off Viking raiders. While this brought temporary peace, it also funded further expeditions and proved unsustainable. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records increasingly desperate payments, culminating in a massive payment of 48,000 pounds in 1012.

In 1013, Sweyn Forkbeard, King of Denmark, conquered England, forcing Æthelred into exile. Though Sweyn died shortly after, his son Cnut established a North Sea Empire encompassing England, Denmark, Norway, and parts of Sweden. Cnut's reign (1016-1035) brought stability and integration between Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian elites. He ruled according to English law, patronised the Church, and married Æthelred's widow Emma of Normandy.

The restoration of the Anglo-Saxon dynasty under Edward the Confessor (1042-1066) brought its own complications. Edward, raised in Normandy, surrounded himself with Norman advisors and favourites, creating tensions with the English earls—particularly the powerful Godwin family. His childlessness created a succession crisis that would culminate in the events of 1066: the death of Edward on 5 January, the crowning of Harold Godwinson, the Norwegian invasion of Harald Hardrada (defeated by Harold at Stamford Bridge), and the Norman Conquest that followed.

## Everyday Life in Anglo-Saxon and Viking Britain

### Rural Economy and Village Life

The vast majority of the population in Anglo-Saxon and Viking Britain lived in rural settlements and engaged in agriculture. The typical settlement consisted of a cluster of farms (often linked by kinship ties), with each farmstead comprising a main hall for living, sleeping, and eating, plus outbuildings for animals and storage.

Anglo-Saxon and Viking buildings were typically constructed using timber frames with wattle-and-daub walls (woven branches plastered with mud or clay) and thatched roofs. The size and quality of buildings varied according to status, from the great halls of kings and nobles to the modest dwellings of ceorls.

Agriculture was mixed, combining arable farming (cereals such as wheat, barley, and rye) with animal husbandry (cattle, sheep, pigs, and poultry). The open-field system, with its characteristic ridge-and-furrow pattern (still visible in some areas), began to develop during this period. Fields were divided into strips, with each household holding scattered strips across the village's arable land to ensure fair distribution of good and poor soil.

Technology was sophisticated in its own way. Iron ploughshares enabled deeper cultivation of heavier soils, while watermills (mentioned in the Domesday Book but established earlier) ground grain. Textile production—spinning, weaving, and dyeing—was largely domestic, with women responsible for producing the cloth needed for household use and tribute.

### Trade and Towns

While most people lived in rural settlements, the period saw significant growth of towns (burhs or boroughs). Many of these developed from the fortified sites established by Alfred and his successors, combining defensive, administrative, and commercial functions.

Trade was extensive, both within the British Isles and across the North Sea and Atlantic. Viking traders reached as far as Constantinople (via the Russian rivers), the Mediterranean, and North America. Archaeological finds from Viking towns include goods from the Middle East, the Baltic, and the Mediterranean, demonstrating the cosmopolitan nature of these settlements.

Coinage became increasingly important during this period. While early Anglo-Saxon trade may have relied on bullion (precious metal by weight), by the time of Alfred coinage was well-established. Alfred's reform of the coinage introduced a standardised silver penny that would remain the basis of English currency for centuries.

### Women, Family, and Social Structure

Anglo-Saxon and Viking societies were patriarchal, but women held significant rights and responsibilities that would be eroded in later medieval periods. Anglo-Saxon women could own property, make wills, and in some cases sue for divorce. High-status women could be significant landowners and patrons of religious houses.

Viking women enjoyed comparable or greater rights. They could inherit property, initiate divorce, and in some circumstances fight alongside men (though the popular image of shield-maidens is debated among historians). The graves at Birka in Sweden include a high-status warrior burial that recent DNA analysis identified as female, challenging assumptions about gender roles.

Marriage was an important social institution, linking families and transferring property. Dowries and bride-prices cemented these alliances. However, divorce was possible under certain circumstances, particularly in Norse society.

Slavery (thralls, theows) was widespread in both Anglo-Saxon and Viking societies. Slaves were property, bought and sold, though they could be freed and some legal protections existed. The Church encouraged manumission (freeing of slaves) as a pious act, and by the end of the Anglo-Saxon period slavery was gradually declining, replaced by villeinage (serfdom).

## Religion and the Conversion to Christianity

### Pagan Beliefs

Before the conversion to Christianity, both Anglo-Saxons and Vikings followed pagan religions derived from their Germanic heritage. These religions were polytheistic, with pantheons of gods and goddesses associated with war, fertility, wisdom, and the natural world.

Anglo-Saxon paganism is poorly documented, as literacy arrived with Christianity. The names of days of the week preserve some god names: Tiw (Tuesday), Woden (Wednesday), Thunor/Thor (Thursday), and Frige (Friday). The Norse pantheon is better documented through later Icelandic sources, including the Prose Edda and Poetic Edda, though these were written centuries after the Viking Age and reflect a specifically Icelandic context.

### The Conversion of the Anglo-Saxons

The conversion of Anglo-Saxon England to Christianity was a gradual process spanning more than a century. The mission sent by Pope Gregory the Great in 597, led by Augustine, established Christianity in Kent but initially made little progress elsewhere. More significant was the Irish mission to Northumbria from Iona, led by Aidan, which established the monastery at Lindisfarne and converted King Oswald and his court.

The Synod of Whitby (664) resolved tensions between the Roman and Irish traditions, opting for Roman practices regarding the dating of Easter and the shape of the monastic tonsure. This decision aligned the English Church with Roman Christianity and strengthened ties to continental Europe.

The conversion had profound cultural consequences. Monasteries became centres of learning, preserving and copying manuscripts, including not only religious texts but also works of classical literature. The Venerable Bede, a monk at the monastery of Wearmouth-Jarrow, wrote his Ecclesiastical History of the English People—the single most important source for early Anglo-Saxon history. The artistic achievements of the period, exemplified by the Lindisfarne Gospels, demonstrate the fusion of Celtic, Anglo-Saxon, and Mediterranean artistic traditions.

### The Conversion of the Vikings

The conversion of the Scandinavian settlers followed a different pattern. Viking armies and settlers initially remained pagan, and the period of Viking settlement saw the destruction of many monasteries and churches. However, the settled Scandinavian population gradually adopted Christianity through contact with the Anglo-Saxon population and through the conversion of Viking leaders.

The conversion of Guthrum, the Viking leader defeated by Alfred at Edington, was a significant moment. As part of the peace settlement, Guthrum accepted baptism, taking the Christian name Æthelstan. This political conversion set a pattern that would be followed by other Scandinavian rulers in England and Scandinavia.

By the eleventh century, both England and Scandinavia were largely Christian. King Cnut, despite his Scandinavian heritage, was a pious Christian who patronised the Church and made pilgrimages to Rome. The fusion of Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian populations was partly facilitated by their shared Christian identity.

## Teaching Approaches and Pedagogical Considerations

### Developing Chronological Understanding

The Anglo-Saxon and Viking period presents particular challenges for developing chronological understanding. The period spans over 600 years—comparable to the time between the present day and the fourteenth century—yet pupils often compress this into a single undifferentiated "olden days."

Effective teaching establishes clear chronological markers: the Roman withdrawal (c. 410), the Adventus Saxonum (fifth-sixth centuries), the conversion to Christianity (seventh century), the Viking raids (late eighth century onwards), Alfred's reign (871-899), and the Norman Conquest (1066). Creating a large-scale timeline that pupils can add to throughout the topic helps establish this chronology.

It is also important to help pupils understand the overlaps and simultaneities within the period. The Viking raids were happening while Anglo-Saxon England was already well-established; Alfred the Great was fighting Vikings at the same time as other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were flourishing or falling. The traditional division between "Anglo-Saxon" and "Viking" periods obscures the fact that these were concurrent and overlapping phenomena.

### Using Evidence and Sources

The Anglo-Saxon and Viking period offers rich opportunities for working with historical evidence. Archaeological evidence—from spectacular finds like Sutton Hoo and the Staffordshire Hoard to everyday objects like pottery and tools—provides tangible connections to the past. Pupils can learn to "read" archaeological evidence, considering what objects tell us about the people who made and used them.

Written sources, though limited, offer opportunities for source analysis. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Bede's Ecclesiastical History, and various charters and wills can be excerpted for classroom use. Pupils can consider the perspective of these sources—why were they written, who wrote them, what might they have left out?

Place names and linguistic evidence offer another form of historical source. Mapping Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian place names in the local area connects the national narrative to pupils' own experience. Exploring words of Old English and Old Norse origin in modern English demonstrates the linguistic legacy of this period.

### Addressing Common Misconceptions

Several common misconceptions need addressing when teaching this topic:

**The "empty Britain" myth:** Pupils often imagine that Roman withdrawal left an empty landscape waiting for Anglo-Saxon settlers. In fact, a substantial Romanised British population remained, and the Anglo-Saxon settlement was a process of interaction, conflict, and assimilation rather than simple replacement.

**The unified Viking identity:** Popular culture presents Vikings as a unified nation or ethnicity. In fact, "Viking" describes an activity (raiding, trading, exploring) rather than an ethnic identity. Scandinavians came from different kingdoms and regions (Denmark, Norway, Sweden) and often fought each other as much as they fought the Anglo-Saxons.

**The "dark ages":** The term "Dark Ages" suggests a period of decline and ignorance. While the period certainly saw disruption and violence, it also produced remarkable cultural achievements—the Lindisfarne Gospels, the poetry of Beowulf, the scholarship of Bede—and significant technological and social developments.

**Stereotypes of violence:** While violence was certainly a feature of the period (as of most historical periods), an exclusive focus on raids, battles, and invasions distorts the picture. Most people lived peaceful agricultural lives, and much of the contact between Anglo-Saxons, Britons, and Scandinavians involved trade, intermarriage, and cultural exchange.

### Enquiry Questions and Historical Thinking

Effective teaching of this topic is organised around enquiry questions that promote historical thinking:

- How do we know about the Anglo-Saxons and Vikings? (Evidence and interpretation)
- Why did the Anglo-Saxons and Vikings come to Britain? (Cause and consequence)
- How did the coming of the Anglo-Saxons and Vikings change Britain? (Change and continuity)
- How similar were Anglo-Saxon and Viking ways of life? (Similarity and difference)
- How should we remember Alfred the Great? (Significance)
- Were the Vikings really so bad? (Interpretations)

These enquiry questions connect the substantive content to disciplinary concepts, helping pupils develop their historical understanding while learning about the period.

### Local and Regional Connections

The Anglo-Saxon and Viking period offers excellent opportunities for local history studies. Many areas retain physical evidence from the period—earthworks, churches with Anglo-Saxon fabric, place names, and field patterns. Local museums often hold collections of Anglo-Saxon and Viking material, and archaeological units may be able to provide information about recent excavations.

The pattern of Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian settlement varied significantly across the country. Areas with heavy Scandinavian settlement (Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, East Midlands) have a very different heritage from areas where British kingdoms survived longer (Wales, Cornwall, Cumbria) or where Anglo-Saxon settlement was less dense. Exploring these regional differences helps pupils understand that "British history" is not a single uniform narrative but a patchwork of local and regional experiences.

### Cross-Curricular Links

The Anglo-Saxon and Viking period offers rich opportunities for cross-curricular learning:

**English:** Old English and Old Norse vocabulary; the poetry of Beowulf and other Anglo-Saxon literature; place name studies.

**Geography:** Settlement patterns and site selection; trade routes and connections; the physical geography of the British Isles and Scandinavia.

**Art and Design:** Anglo-Saxon and Viking art styles, particularly interlace decoration and animal ornament; illuminated manuscripts; metalwork and jewellery.

**RE:** The conversion to Christianity; pagan beliefs and practices; the role of monasteries; Christian art and architecture.

**Computing:** Using databases to analyse archaeological finds; creating digital timelines; exploring virtual reconstructions of Anglo-Saxon and Viking settlements.

## Conclusion

Anglo-Saxon and Viking Britain stands as one of the most important topics in the primary history curriculum. This period of over six centuries saw the emergence of England as a political entity, the establishment of English as a language, and the creation of many of the institutions and patterns of settlement that would shape British history for centuries to come.

Teaching this topic effectively requires balancing the narrative of invasion and conflict with an understanding of everyday life, cultural exchange, and gradual change. It requires helping pupils navigate the complexities of evidence—from archaeology, place names, written sources, and linguistic survivals—to build their own understanding of the period. And it requires connecting the national narrative to local and regional experiences, helping pupils see how this distant past relates to their own lives and communities.

The period also offers a valuable opportunity to explore historical concepts and develop pupils' disciplinary thinking. Questions of cause and consequence, change and continuity, similarity and difference, significance and interpretation run throughout the topic, providing a rich context for developing historical understanding.

As the Historical Association notes, this was indeed "the most formative period in British history." The Anglo-Saxon and Viking legacy surrounds us—in our language, our place names, our institutions, and our genetic heritage. Understanding this period is essential for understanding how Britain became the country it is today.
