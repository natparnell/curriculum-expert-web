# Medieval Britain 1066-1509

## Overview

Medieval Britain (1066-1509) represents one of the most transformative periods in British history and forms a core component of the Key Stage 3 National Curriculum. This era witnessed the Norman Conquest, which fundamentally reshaped English society, the development of parliamentary institutions through Magna Carta, devastating demographic collapse during the Black Death, and significant social upheaval epitomised by the Peasants' Revolt. Understanding this period is essential for pupils to comprehend the long arc of British constitutional development, the evolution of social hierarchies, and the interplay between Church, state, and society that characterises medieval history.

The National Curriculum specifies that pupils should study "the development of Church, state and society in Medieval Britain 1066-1509." While the Department for Education provides suggested content—including the Norman Conquest, Christendom and the Crusades, struggles between Church and crown, Magna Carta, the Black Death, and the Peasants' Revolt—schools have considerable flexibility in determining which particular events to include and how to combine overview and depth studies.

## The Norman Conquest 1066

### Historical Context and Events

The Norman Conquest of 1066 represents a watershed moment in British history, marking the last successful invasion of England. The death of Edward the Confessor in January 1066 triggered a succession crisis that drew in claimants from across Europe. Harold Godwinson, Earl of Wessex, was crowned king by the Witan, but his position was immediately contested by William, Duke of Normandy, who claimed Edward had promised him the throne, and Harald Hardrada of Norway.

The events of 1066 unfolded with remarkable speed. Harold defeated Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September, but three days later, William's forces landed at Pevensey. The Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066 saw Harold's death and the decisive Norman victory. William was crowned King of England in Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066.

The conquest was not immediately secure. William faced rebellions across England between 1067 and 1071, leading to the brutal "Harrying of the North" in 1069-1070. The Domesday Book of 1086, commissioned to assess the kingdom's resources for taxation, provides unprecedented evidence of the social and economic transformation that occurred within a generation.

### The Norman Transformation of England

The Norman Conquest brought profound changes to English governance, society, and culture. William introduced the feudal system, whereby land was held in exchange for military service, creating a hierarchical structure with the king at its apex. Norman French became the language of the court, administration, and the elite, profoundly influencing the development of the English language.

The construction of motte-and-bailey castles, and later stone keeps, established Norman military control across the landscape. The church was reorganised, with Norman bishops and abbots replacing English incumbents. Large areas of land were granted to Norman followers, displacing the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy. By 1086, as Domesday reveals, the great majority of landholders were Norman.

### Pedagogical Approaches: Teaching the Norman Conquest

#### Enquiry Questions

Effective teaching of the Norman Conquest employs enquiry questions that develop pupils' disciplinary thinking. Rather than simply recounting the events of 1066, enquiry-based approaches encourage pupils to engage with historical evidence and construct arguments:

- **"Why did William win the Battle of Hastings?"** — This classic enquiry requires pupils to evaluate multiple factors: William's military tactics, Norman cavalry versus Saxon infantry, Harold's exhausted army, Harold's strategic errors, and divine intervention (as contemporaries believed). Pupils learn that historical explanation requires weighing competing factors.

- **"How much did England change after 1066?"** — This enquiry moves beyond the events of conquest to assess impact. Using Domesday Book extracts, pupils can compare Anglo-Saxon and Norman England, evaluating continuities and changes in landholding, language, architecture, and law.

- **"Was the Norman Conquest a good thing for England?"** — This judgement question, whilst anachronistic, encourages pupils to consider multiple perspectives: the Norman aristocracy who gained land, English peasants whose lives may have continued largely unchanged, Anglo-Saxon nobles who lost status, and the Church which gained magnificent cathedrals but lost independence.

#### Using Sources and Evidence

The Bayeux Tapestry provides an invaluable but problematic source for teaching. As a Norman-sponsored artefact created within a generation of the conquest, it offers detailed visual evidence of contemporary military equipment, ships, and tactics. However, pupils should analyse its biases: Harold's oath to William (of which English sources are silent), the portrayal of Harold's death, and the legitimisation of Norman rule. Comparing the Tapestry with Anglo-Saxon Chronicle accounts develops pupils' understanding of contested historical interpretation.

#### Common Pupil Misconceptions

Research and classroom experience reveal several persistent misconceptions about the Norman Conquest:

- **The arrow in the eye:** Many pupils believe Harold definitely died from an arrow to the eye, as shown in the Bayeux Tapestry. Historians debate this, and the Tapestry itself is ambiguous. The earliest narrative sources describe Harold being cut down by Norman knights.

- **Immediate transformation:** Pupils often assume England changed overnight in 1066. In reality, change was gradual—Domesday Book shows significant English landholders still existed in 1086, and English remained the language of the majority.

- **Norman superiority:** Textbooks sometimes imply the Normans were culturally superior to the English. Teachers should challenge this by highlighting Anglo-Saxon achievements in administration, law, and literature that continued after 1066.

#### Teaching Strategies

**Role play and simulation:** Pupils can stage the Witan's deliberations over the succession, defending the claims of Harold, William, and Edgar Ætheling. This develops understanding of how legitimacy was constructed in medieval politics.

**Castle building:** Practical activities involving constructing model motte-and-bailey castles help pupils understand the military logic of Norman fortification and the labour resources required.

**Domesday detective work:** Using translated extracts from Domesday Book, pupils can investigate specific manors, comparing values before and after 1066, identifying Norman landholders, and assessing the extent of displacement.

## Magna Carta and the Emergence of Parliament 1215

### Historical Background

King John's reign (1199-1216) was marked by military failures, including the loss of Normandy to Philip II of France in 1204, and costly conflicts that strained royal finances. John's arbitrary taxation, abuse of feudal customs, and conflicts with the Church (particularly the Interdict of 1208-1214) alienated the baronage and broader political community.

By 1215, rebellion was widespread. Barons gathered at Stamford and Lincoln, renouncing their homage to John. They captured London in May 1215, forcing John to negotiate. The resulting document, sealed at Runnymede on 15 June 1215, was not originally called "Magna Carta"—this name emerged later to distinguish it from the smaller Charter of the Forest.

Magna Carta contained 63 clauses addressing specific grievances: protection from arbitrary imprisonment (clause 39, the basis of habeas corpus), limits on taxation without consent, standardisation of weights and measures, and restrictions on royal interference with the Church. The original charter was annulled by Pope Innocent III, leading to the First Barons' War. John died in October 1216, leaving his nine-year-old son Henry III as king.

### The Evolution of Magna Carta's Significance

The immediate significance of Magna Carta should not be exaggerated. It was a feudal document addressing feudal grievances, and its clauses were reissued, modified, and selectively enforced over subsequent centuries. However, Magna Carta acquired symbolic importance as a touchstone for constitutional liberties.

Henry III's minority government reissued the charter in 1216 and 1217 to secure support. Edward I's Confirmation of the Charters in 1297 established the principle that taxation required parliamentary consent—a crucial development in the emergence of Parliament as an institution. In the seventeenth century, opponents of Stuart absolutism cited Magna Carta against Charles I, interpreting it through the lens of their own political struggles.

### The Development of Parliament

The emergence of Parliament during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries transformed English governance. Originally meaning simply "discussion" or "meeting," Parliament evolved from the king's council into a representative institution with defined powers.

Simon de Montfort's Parliament of 1265, held during the Second Barons' War, was significant for including burgesses from towns alongside knights of the shire. Though de Montfort was defeated at Evesham, his parliament served as a model. Edward I's "Model Parliament" of 1295 established the precedent that representatives of the shires, boroughs, and clergy should attend, giving Parliament its characteristic composition.

By the fourteenth century, Parliament had separated into two Houses—Lords and Commons—and gained the power to grant taxation and petition the king. The development of impeachment and the requirement that statutes receive parliamentary consent marked the emergence of Parliament as a constitutional check on royal power.

### Pedagogical Approaches: Teaching Magna Carta

#### Enquiry Questions

- **"Why was King John forced to sign Magna Carta?"** — This enquiry examines the causes of the 1215 crisis, helping pupils understand how medieval kingship worked, the balance of power between crown and baronage, and the specific grievances that motivated rebellion.

- **"Did Magna Carta really change anything in 1215?"** — This challenging question encourages pupils to distinguish between Magna Carta's immediate impact and its later symbolic significance. Evidence of its annulment, the Barons' War, and Henry III's minority helps pupils understand the charter's limitations.

- **"Why is Magna Carta still important today?"** — This connects medieval history to contemporary citizenship, exploring how subsequent generations reinterpreted Magna Carta. Pupils can trace its influence on the US Constitution, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and modern conceptions of the rule of law.

#### Teaching Constitutional Significance

Magna Carta offers an opportunity to teach pupils about the rule of law and constitutional development. Key teaching points include:

**Clause 39:** "No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land."

Whilst the narrow definition of "free man" and the feudal context must be acknowledged, this clause established the principle that the king was subject to law—a revolutionary concept in medieval Europe.

**The "tyranny" narrative:** Pupils should understand how seventeenth-century opponents of Charles I reinterpreted Magna Carta, projecting their own concerns onto the medieval document. This teaches valuable lessons about anachronism and the changing uses of historical symbols.

#### Common Misconceptions

- **Democratic document:** Pupils often assume Magna Carta established democracy. Teachers must clarify that it protected feudal privileges, not universal rights, and applied only to a small elite.

- **Immediate effect:** Many pupils believe Magna Carta immediately limited royal power. In fact, it was annulled within weeks, and the struggle between crown and Parliament continued for centuries.

- **Written constitution:** Pupils sometimes describe Magna Carta as "Britain's constitution." While influential, Britain has no single written constitution, and Magna Carta's clauses were substantially modified over time.

#### Classroom Strategies

**Source analysis:** Comparing the 1215 charter with Edward I's 1297 Confirmation reveals how the document was adapted. Pupils can identify which clauses were retained and which discarded.

**Role play:** Simulating the 1215 negotiations between John and the barons helps pupils understand the power dynamics and competing interests. Pupils can represent different groups—royal officials, northern barons, London merchants, Church leaders—and negotiate their own charter.

**Longitudinal study:** Following Magna Carta's "afterlife" through the seventeenth century (Coke, the Petition of Right, the Civil War) shows pupils how historical documents acquire new meanings in different contexts.

## The Black Death 1348-1350

### The Pandemic and Its Course

The Black Death arrived in England in June 1348, carried by ships entering Melcombe Regis (modern Weymouth) in Dorset. Within eighteen months, it had swept through the entire kingdom, killing between one-third and one-half of the population—approximately 1.5 to 2 million people. The pandemic was caused by Yersinia pestis, transmitted by fleas carried on black rats, though recent research suggests human fleas and lice may also have played a role.

The plague spread rapidly along trade routes and river systems. Contemporary chronicler Geoffrey le Baker described the symptoms: painful swellings (buboes) in the lymph nodes, fever, and the characteristic black spots that gave the disease its name. Most victims died within days. The psychological impact was profound—chroniclers report widespread despair, religious fervour, and social breakdown.

Successive outbreaks occurred throughout the later fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The plague returned in 1361-1362 (the "Children's Plague," which particularly affected the young), 1369, 1375, and repeatedly thereafter. These recurrent outbreaks prevented population recovery, keeping England's population depressed until the early sixteenth century.

### Social and Economic Impact

The demographic catastrophe of the Black Death transformed English society. The labour shortage caused by population collapse fundamentally altered the balance of power between lords and peasants:

**Labour mobility:** With fewer workers available, surviving peasants could demand higher wages or seek better conditions elsewhere. The Statute of Labourers (1351), which attempted to fix wages at pre-plague levels, proved largely unenforceable and generated resentment.

**The decline of serfdom:** Personal unfreedom (serfdom/villeinage) declined rapidly after the plague. Lords increasingly commuted labour services for money payments, freeing peasants from direct servitude while maintaining economic exploitation through rent.

**Rising living standards:** Surprisingly, the Black Death improved living standards for the surviving peasantry. With abundant land available, peasants could negotiate better terms. Real wages rose substantially in the later fourteenth century, though this trend reversed in the fifteenth century.

**Religious and cultural changes:** The Church's inability to prevent the plague undermined its authority. The rise of vernacular theology, the popularity of mysticism, and eventually the Lollard movement (associated with John Wycliffe) reflected dissatisfaction with institutional religion.

### The Peasants' Revolt 1381

The Peasants' Revolt of 1381 represents the most significant popular uprising of the medieval period. Triggered by the poll tax of 1380—a flat-rate tax that fell disproportionately on the poor—the revolt spread rapidly across south-east England. Rebels under Wat Tyler, Jack Straw, and the radical priest John Ball marched on London.

The rebels occupied London on 13-15 June 1381, destroying legal records (which documented villein status and debts), burning John of Gaunt's palace at the Savoy, and executing the Archbishop of Canterbury and other officials. At Mile End and Smithfield, the fourteen-year-old Richard II met the rebels, promising charters of emancipation.

The revolt collapsed after Wat Tyler's death at Smithfield. Richard's promises were revoked, and the rebellion was brutally suppressed. However, the poll tax was abandoned, and the long-term trends toward peasant freedom continued.

### Pedagogical Approaches: Teaching the Black Death

#### Enquiry Questions

- **"Was the Black Death a disaster for everyone?"** — This counter-intuitive question challenges pupils to consider differential impacts. While catastrophic for individuals, the plague improved conditions for surviving workers, weakened serfdom, and created opportunities for social mobility.

- **"Why did the Peasants' Revolt happen in 1381?"** — This requires pupils to connect long-term causes (post-plague social changes) with short-term triggers (the poll tax), developing understanding of historical causation.

- **"What was it like to live through the Black Death?"** — This empathetic enquiry uses contemporary sources (chronicles, wills, manorial records) to help pupils understand individual experiences whilst maintaining historical distance.

#### Using Sources and Evidence

Contemporary accounts of the Black Death present both opportunities and challenges for teaching. Sources include:

**Chronicles:** Geoffrey le Baker, Henry Knighton, and the Anonimalle Chronicle provide vivid but often exaggerated descriptions. Pupils should analyse how medieval writers interpreted the plague—often as divine punishment—and compare their accounts with modern scientific understanding.

**Manorial records:** Court rolls documenting land transfers, labour shortages, and wage demands provide quantitative evidence of the plague's economic impact. Even simple exercises—counting entries before and after 1349—reveal dramatic demographic change.

**Archaeological evidence:** Excavations of mass burial sites (such as East Smithfield, London) provide physical evidence of the plague's scale and the emergency measures taken.

#### Common Misconceptions

- **Everyone died:** Pupils often overestimate mortality, imagining total collapse. While devastating, 40-50% mortality meant most communities survived, albeit transformed.

- **Immediate revolt:** The 1381 revolt is sometimes presented as a direct response to the plague. Teachers should emphasise the thirty-year gap and intervening factors (poll tax, Statute of Labourers).

- **Simple cause-effect:** Pupils may assume the plague "caused" the end of serfdom. In reality, the relationship was complex—lords resisted change, and serfdom's decline was gradual and contested.

#### Teaching Strategies

**The plague village simulation:** Role play exercises where pupils experience decision-making in a plague-affected community help develop understanding of the social tensions the pandemic
