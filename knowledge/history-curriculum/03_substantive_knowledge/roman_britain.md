# Roman Britain

## Overview and National Curriculum Position

Roman Britain represents one of the most substantial and well-documented periods in British history, occupying a central position within the Key Stage 2 National Curriculum. The statutory programmes of study require pupils to study "the Roman Empire and its impact on Britain," making this topic essential for primary history teaching. The 2014 National Curriculum brought significant changes to how this topic should be approached, most notably placing Roman Britain within the broader context of the Roman Empire rather than treating it as an isolated British episode.

The Historical Association emphasises that this topic offers exceptional opportunities for developing pupils' understanding of historical concepts including causation, change and continuity, and historical significance. The richness of archaeological and literary evidence from this period makes it particularly valuable for teaching source evaluation and historical interpretation. Unlike many earlier periods, Roman Britain offers a combination of physical remains, contemporary written accounts, and extensive archaeological discoveries that enable pupils to engage authentically with historical enquiry.

From the founding of Rome in the 8th century BC, Roman power expanded steadily across the Mediterranean world. By the 1st century AD, Rome controlled an empire stretching across three continents. Britain became part of this empire following the successful invasion of AD 43, remaining under Roman rule for nearly four centuries until the withdrawal of troops in AD 410. This extended period of occupation left an indelible mark on the British landscape, language, culture, and governance that persists into the present day.

## The Invasion and Conquest of Britain

### Caesar's Expeditions (55-54 BC)

Julius Caesar's two brief expeditions to Britain in 55 and 54 BC represent the first recorded contact between Britain and the Roman world. These were not attempts at conquest but rather reconnaissance missions designed to gather intelligence and demonstrate Roman power to the tribes of Gaul who maintained connections with their British counterparts. Caesar's own writings, preserved in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico (Commentaries on the Gallic War), provide our earliest detailed descriptions of Britain and its inhabitants.

For teaching purposes, Caesar's accounts offer valuable opportunities to introduce pupils to the concept of historical sources and bias. Caesar wrote to enhance his own reputation and justify his campaigns to the Roman Senate. His descriptions of Britons as barbaric and his exaggeration of Roman successes should be examined critically with pupils. The Historical Association recommends using extracts from Caesar's writings alongside archaeological evidence to help pupils understand how historians reconstruct the past from multiple sources.

### The Claudian Invasion of AD 43

The proper conquest of Britain began in earnest in AD 43 under the Emperor Claudius. Unlike Caesar's fleeting visits, this was a substantial military campaign involving four legions—approximately 40,000 troops—along with auxiliary forces. The invasion force landed at Richborough in Kent and quickly established a beachhead from which to advance into the British interior.

Contemporary accounts suggest that Claudius himself visited Britain shortly after the initial invasion, bringing elephants to overawe the native tribes. This detail, recorded by Roman historians, provides an excellent entry point for discussing Roman propaganda and the theatre of power with pupils. The rapid establishment of the province of Britannia, the construction of roads connecting strategic points, and the founding of towns including Londinium (London), Eboracum (York), and Verulamium (St Albans) followed swiftly.

Teaching this period effectively requires balancing narrative excitement with substantive historical understanding. The invasion can be approached through enquiry questions such as "Why did the Romans invade Britain?" and "How were they able to conquer so quickly?" These questions encourage pupils to consider economic motivations (Britain's mineral resources, particularly tin, lead, and silver), political factors (Claudius's need for military glory to secure his position), and military advantages (Roman discipline, engineering, and tactics).

### Resistance and Romanisation

The Roman conquest was not achieved without resistance. The most significant early opposition came from Caratacus (Caractacus), a chieftain of the Catuvellauni tribe who led a protracted guerrilla campaign against Roman forces. His eventual capture and the speech he reportedly gave before the Roman Senate, as recorded by Tacitus, provides another rich source for exploring different perspectives on empire and resistance.

The process of Romanisation—the adoption of Roman customs, language, and lifestyle by native Britons—varied significantly across regions and social classes. In towns and villas, Britons adopted Latin, Roman dress, and Roman architectural styles. The countryside, however, saw less dramatic change, with many rural Britons continuing traditional ways of life while acknowledging Roman political authority through taxation and occasional participation in Roman religious practices.

## Boudica and the Revolt of AD 60/61

### Historical Context

The Boudican revolt represents the most serious challenge to Roman rule in Britain during the first century AD. According to Tacitus and Cassius Dio, the immediate causes lay in the mistreatment of Boudica (commonly spelled Boudicca in older sources), queen of the Iceni tribe, and her daughters following the death of her husband Prasutagus. Roman officials seized Iceni territory, had Boudica flogged, and assaulted her daughters, provoking a desperate uprising.

The revolt was not merely a spontaneous outburst of anger but reflected wider resentment against Roman taxation, confiscation of land, and cultural imposition. Boudica united several tribes including the Iceni and Trinovantes, amassing a substantial force that achieved significant initial successes. The rebels destroyed Camulodunum (Colchester), the first Roman colonia in Britain, killing its inhabitants and burning the temple dedicated to the Emperor Claudius. They then proceeded to destroy Londinium and Verulamium, massacring the Roman and Romanised populations.

### Teaching Boudica: Interpretations and Significance

Boudica has become one of the most iconic figures in British history, yet her historical significance is complex and contested. For teaching purposes, she offers exceptional opportunities to explore historical interpretation. Pupils can examine how Boudica has been portrayed differently across time periods—as a British patriot in Victorian accounts, a feminist icon in modern interpretations, and a destructive force in Roman sources.

The Keystage History approach recommends using the concept of a "living graph" to help pupils understand the trajectory of Boudica's rebellion. This visual tool plots the ups and downs of her campaign, from the initial provocation through the victories at Camulodunum, Londinium, and Verulamium to the final defeat and her apparent suicide. This approach helps pupils grasp the narrative while developing understanding of causation and consequence.

Key enquiry questions for this topic include: "Was Boudica a hero or a villain?" and "Why do different sources portray Boudica so differently?" These questions encourage pupils to recognise that historical interpretation depends on perspective and purpose. Roman sources emphasised her ferocity and the destruction she caused; later British sources celebrated her resistance to foreign oppression. Neither portrayal is simply "true" or "false"—each reflects the values and concerns of its time.

### Archaeological Evidence

The destruction layers left by Boudica's revolt provide rare archaeological confirmation of historical events. Excavations in London, Colchester, and St Albans have revealed distinctive red-burned layers dating to AD 60/61, containing melted coins, charred building remains, and occasional human remains. This archaeological evidence allows pupils to engage directly with the physical traces of historical events, making abstract narratives concrete and tangible.

English Heritage and the Museum of London offer extensive teaching resources based on these archaeological discoveries. The presence of a red-burned layer beneath modern London, for instance, can be used to demonstrate how historians combine written sources with material evidence to reconstruct the past. Pupils can examine photographs of excavations, handle replica artefacts, and consider what different types of evidence can and cannot tell us about historical events.

## Hadrian's Wall and the Northern Frontier

### Construction and Purpose

Hadrian's Wall stands as the most dramatic physical monument of Roman Britain. Built on the orders of Emperor Hadrian following his visit to Britain in AD 122, the Wall stretched 73 miles (80 Roman miles) across northern Britain from Wallsend on the River Tyne to Bowness-on-Solway in Cumbria. Construction was undertaken by the Roman army over approximately six years, involving the three legions stationed in Britain.

The traditional view that Hadrian's Wall was built simply to keep Scottish tribes out has been revised by modern scholarship. Current understanding, supported by English Heritage research, suggests a more complex purpose involving control of movement, customs collection, demonstration of Roman power, and management of the frontier zone. The Wall was not merely a defensive barrier but part of a sophisticated system of frontier management that included forts, milecastles, turrets, and the Vallum (a substantial earthwork running parallel to the Wall).

### Teaching Hadrian's Wall

Hadrian's Wall offers exceptional opportunities for site visits and virtual learning. English Heritage maintains several sites along the Wall including Housesteads (the most complete Roman fort in Britain), Birdoswald, and Chesters. These sites enable pupils to experience the scale of Roman engineering and imagine the lives of soldiers stationed on this remote frontier.

For schools unable to visit in person, English Heritage provides extensive digital resources including virtual tours, 3D reconstructions, and animated films depicting life along the Wall. The story of the Wall can be approached through individual narratives—Marcus the legionary, the commander at Housesteads, or the local British family living near the fort—to make the grand historical narrative accessible to primary pupils.

The diversity of the Roman army provides another valuable teaching angle. Archaeological evidence from the Wall reveals that Roman soldiers came from across the empire—Syria, Spain, Germany, and North Africa. This diversity challenges modern assumptions about the ancient world and offers opportunities to discuss migration, cultural exchange, and the cosmopolitan nature of the Roman Empire. The famous tombstone of Regina, a British woman who married a Syrian soldier at South Shields, exemplifies these cross-cultural connections.

### The World on the Wall

Recent archaeological research has revealed the extraordinary cosmopolitan nature of Hadrian's Wall. Inscriptions and artefacts demonstrate that soldiers from Syria, Dacia (modern Romania), Spain, and North Africa served alongside native Britons and soldiers from other parts of the empire. This diversity extended to religious practices, with evidence of worship of Eastern deities including Mithras alongside traditional Roman gods and local British cults.

Teaching this cosmopolitan aspect of Roman Britain helps counter the tendency to view the past as monolithically "white" or homogeneous. Pupils can learn that the Roman Empire, like modern Britain, was characterised by movement of peoples, cultural exchange, and diverse identities. The Historical Association's "World on the Wall" resources provide lesson plans and materials for exploring these themes with primary pupils.

## Daily Life in Roman Britain

### Towns and Urban Life

Roman Britain saw the introduction of urban life to a previously rural island. Towns served as administrative centres, marketplaces, and demonstrations of Roman civilisation. The layout of Roman towns followed a standardised pattern with a forum (market square and administrative centre), basilica (town hall), temples, baths, and grid-pattern streets. This regularity reflects the Roman approach to urban planning and administration.

Archaeological excavations at towns including Silchester, Caerwent, and St Albans have revealed substantial stone buildings, sophisticated water systems, and evidence of trade with across the empire. Teaching about Roman towns can incorporate virtual tours of these sites, examination of plans and reconstructions, and consideration of how urban life differed from the rural existence of most Britons.

The Roman baths represent one of the most distinctive aspects of Roman urban culture. These were not merely places to wash but social centres where people conducted business, exercised, and relaxed. The baths at Bath (Aquae Sulis), with their hot springs dedicated to the goddess Sulis-Minerva, demonstrate the fusion of Roman and British religious traditions that characterised much of Romano-British culture.

### Villas and Country Life

Roman villas—the country houses of wealthy Romans and Romanised Britons—represent the most visible archaeological remains of Roman rural life. Over 1,000 villa sites have been identified across Britain, with notable examples including Fishbourne, Bignor, and Chedworth. These buildings typically featured mosaic floors, hypocaust heating, bath suites, and formal gardens, demonstrating the adoption of Roman architectural styles and comforts by the British elite.

Teaching about villas offers opportunities to discuss social class and inequality in Roman Britain. While villa owners enjoyed luxuries imported from across the empire, most Britons continued to live in simple roundhouses not fundamentally different from those of the pre-Roman Iron Age. This contrast helps pupils understand that the impact of Roman rule was experienced very differently by different social groups.

### The Roman Army

The Roman army was the institution that made empire possible, and its presence shaped every aspect of life in Roman Britain. At its peak, approximately 50,000 soldiers were stationed in Britain, representing about 10% of the entire Roman army. These soldiers were not merely fighters but engineers, administrators, and agents of Romanisation.

The army built the roads that connected Britain, constructed towns and forts, and provided a market for British goods and services. Soldiers who completed their 25 years of service received citizenship and a pension, often settling in Britain and intermarrying with the local population. This process contributed significantly to the Romanisation of Britain.

Teaching about the Roman army can incorporate examination of equipment and tactics, discussion of army organisation (legions, cohorts, centuries), and consideration of what life was like for ordinary soldiers. The Vindolanda tablets—letters and documents preserved in the anaerobic conditions at the fort of Vindolanda near Hadrian's Wall—provide an unparalleled glimpse into the daily concerns of Roman soldiers, from requests for warm clothing to birthday party invitations.

## The End of Roman Britain

### Withdrawal and Collapse

The end of Roman Britain was not a single dramatic event but a gradual process spanning several decades. In AD 410, the Emperor Honorius wrote to British cities informing them that they must look to their own defence—the Roman army was being withdrawn to meet threats closer to Rome. This date traditionally marks the end of Roman Britain, though the reality was more complex.

Archaeological evidence suggests that Roman-style life continued in some areas for several generations after 410. Towns remained occupied, coins continued to circulate (though new coinage from Rome ceased), and Roman ways of life persisted. The "end" of Roman Britain was a process of transformation rather than sudden collapse, with Roman, British, and incoming Anglo-Saxon elements gradually combining to create new cultural forms.

### Teaching the End of Roman Britain

The transition from Roman Britain to Anglo-Saxon England presents teaching challenges because it lacks the clear narratives and heroic figures of earlier periods. However, it offers valuable opportunities to discuss how historical periods are defined and how change happens gradually rather than suddenly. Pupils can examine the evidence for continuity and change, considering what aspects of Roman life disappeared and what persisted.

The concept of the "Dark Ages"—once used to describe this period—can be examined critically. Modern archaeology has revealed that this was not a period of total collapse but of transformation and adaptation. This challenges pupils to question traditional historical narratives and consider how new evidence changes our understanding of the past.

## The Legacy of Roman Britain

### Visible Remains

The physical legacy of Roman Britain surrounds us still. Roads originally built by the Romans—including Watling Street, Ermine Street, and the Fosse Way—determined the routes of modern major roads. Towns founded by the Romans remain important urban centres today. London, York, Chester, St Albans, and many other cities began as Roman settlements and have continued to the present day.

Hadrian's Wall and other frontier remains attract millions of visitors annually, serving as tangible connections to the Roman past. These sites enable pupils to experience history directly, walking where Romans walked and touching stones they placed. English Heritage, National Trust, and other organisations provide educational programmes that help schools make the most of these extraordinary resources.

### Language and Culture

The Roman occupation left a permanent mark on the English language. Although English is fundamentally a Germanic language (descended from the tongues of the Anglo-Saxons who arrived after the Roman period), approximately 30% of English vocabulary derives from Latin, largely through the channels of Roman Britain and later Christianisation. Words related to law, government, architecture, and education often have Roman origins.

Place names across Britain preserve Roman memory. Names ending in -chester, -cester, or -caster (from Latin castra, meaning camp) mark Roman fortifications. The River Thames retains its Roman name (Tamesis), as do several other major rivers. These linguistic fossils provide opportunities for local history investigations, as most schools are within reach of a Roman-influenced place name.

### Historical Significance

Ofsted's 2023 history subject report, "Rich Encounters with the Past," emphasised the importance of teaching pupils to understand historical significance—the ways in which events and developments from the past continue to matter in the present. Roman Britain offers exceptional opportunities for developing this understanding.

Pupils can investigate Roman legacies in their own locality, examining road alignments, place names, and architectural influences. They can consider why Roman remains are preserved and celebrated while other aspects of British history receive less attention. These enquiries develop not only historical knowledge but historical consciousness—an understanding of how the past shapes the present.

## Teaching Approaches and Pedagogy

### Enquiry-Based Learning

The Historical Association and Ofsted both recommend enquiry-based approaches to history teaching, and Roman Britain lends itself particularly well to this methodology. Rather than simply transmitting information about Roman Britain, teachers can structure learning around genuine historical questions that pupils investigate using evidence.

Effective enquiry questions for this topic include:
- What impact did the Romans have on Britain?
- Why did Boudica rebel against the Romans?
- How do we know what life was like in Roman Britain?
- Why did the Romans build Hadrian's Wall?
- What did the Romans do for us?

These questions are open-ended enough to sustain investigation while focused enough to guide learning. They require pupils to engage with historical evidence, construct arguments, and reach supported conclusions—developing genuine historical thinking rather than merely memorising facts.

### Using Evidence

Roman Britain offers an unusually rich range of evidence types for primary pupils to engage with. Archaeological evidence includes physical remains (walls, roads,
