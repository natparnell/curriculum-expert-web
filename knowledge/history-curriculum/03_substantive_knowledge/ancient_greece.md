# Ancient Greece: Teaching the Greeks at KS2

## Overview and Rationale

Ancient Greece holds a distinctive position within the primary history National Curriculum as one of the most popular and enduring non-European civilisation studies. The statutory requirement (DfE, 2013) specifies that pupils should study "a study of a non-European society that provides contrasts with British history"—with Ancient Greece being one of three recommended options alongside the early Islamic civilisation and the Mayan civilisation.

The rationale for including Ancient Greece extends far beyond statutory compliance. As the Historical Association (2015) notes, the Ancient Greeks' legacy to us is enormous, ranging from philosophy and architecture to word roots, drama, education, and democracy. The Ancient Greeks were great thinkers and inquirers who wrote down their theories, poems, plays, investigations, and histories, leaving us many and varied texts as well as a rich architectural and archaeological heritage.

Unlike many ancient civilisations, Ancient Greece offers primary teachers an abundance of written sources alongside material evidence. This dual evidentiary base creates unique opportunities for developing pupils' disciplinary understanding of how historians work with different source types.

## National Curriculum Position and Expectations

### Statutory Requirements

The National Curriculum (DfE, 2013) places Ancient Greece within the Key Stage 2 programmes of study under the requirement for "a study of a non-European society." The relevant attainment target requires pupils to know and understand:

- The characteristic features of the period studied
- The social, cultural, religious, and ethnic diversity of the societies studied
- Continuity and change within and across the period studied
- The nature and use of different types of historical sources

### Curriculum Planning Considerations

The Historical Association's 2024 curriculum plan for Ancient Greece recommends a chronological approach spanning from the Bronze Age through to the legacy of Alexander the Great. However, they caution against attempting comprehensive coverage of 2,000 years of history. Instead, teachers should select key periods that illuminate the substantive concepts most valuable for primary pupils.

Oak National Academy organises their Ancient Greece units around enquiry questions that connect to the broader curriculum intent:
1. What do we know about Ancient Greece?
2. How has Ancient Greek civilisation influenced the western world?
3. Why is Alexander called 'The Great'?

These enquiry structures align with Ofsted's (2021) emphasis on pupils building coherent mental schemas through carefully sequenced units of study.

## Who Were the Ancient Greeks?

### A Critical Distinction: City-States, Not a Nation

One of the most important conceptual understandings pupils must develop is that the Ancient Greeks were never part of one united country. Collectively, they called their land **Hellas** and themselves **Hellenes**, sharing a common language, religion, culture, and history. However, Ancient Greece consisted of independent **city-states (poleis)** that spent much time and energy quarrelling and competing with one another.

This political fragmentation represents a fundamental distinction from the unified empires of Rome or Persia that pupils may encounter elsewhere in the curriculum. Geographically, Ancient Greece included:
- The Greek mainland (a rocky, mountainous peninsula)
- Numerous islands scattered across the Aegean and Mediterranean
- Coastal areas of modern Turkey (Ionia) before Persian conquest
- Colonies established across the Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts

### The Greek Landscape and Its Influence

Greece's rocky and mountainous interior and its many islands ensured that the Ancient Greeks were a seafaring people. No wonder that their best-known legends involve voyages—such as Jason and the Argonauts and Odysseus' epic journey home. Greece's position in the eastern Mediterranean meant that throughout its history, people, armies, trade goods, and ideas flowed to and from Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.

The geographical constraints shaped Greek society in significant ways:
- Mountainous terrain made overland travel and communication difficult
- The sea provided the primary means of connection between communities
- Limited fertile land led to the establishment of colonies for agricultural expansion
- Natural harbours encouraged maritime trade and naval power

### The Polis: The Defining Greek Institution

The **polis** (plural: poleis) represents a sophisticated political concept that challenges simple translation. Often rendered as "city-state," the polis actually comprised a city centre (**asty**) and its surrounding agricultural territory (**chora**). Each polis was politically independent, with its own laws, government, army, and identity.

The most famous poleis—**Athens** and **Sparta**—developed radically different systems of government, educational practices, and social values. This contrast provides rich opportunities for comparative study and for challenging pupils' assumptions about "the Greeks" as a monolithic culture.

## Historical Periods for Primary Study

### Period 1: The Bronze Age (c. 2000–1100 BC)

Also known as the Age of Heroes, the Bronze Age offers possibilities for the interplay of archaeology and traditional legends. Key topics include:

#### Minoan Crete
The palace at **Knossos**, associated with King Minos and the legend of **Theseus and the Minotaur**, represents Europe's first advanced civilisation. Sir Arthur Evans' excavations at Knossos at the beginning of the 20th century provide an opportunity to teach about archaeological method and how historical knowledge is constructed.

The volcanic eruption of **Thera** (now Santorini) and the legend of **Icarus**, the boy who flew too close to the sun, offer engaging entry points while developing understanding of how myths encode historical and natural events.

#### The Trojan War
Immortalised in Homer's **Iliad**, the Trojan War narrative includes Helen ("the face that launched a thousand ships"), heroes such as Achilles and Hector, and the famous **Trojan horse** that ended the ten-year siege. Heinrich Schliemann's discovery of the site of Troy and his excavations there in the 1870s make an exciting historical story about how archaeology can validate (or challenge) ancient texts.

#### The Odyssey
The story of **Odysseus'** ten-year journey home from Troy to his wife Penelope on Ithaca provides multiple teaching opportunities. Each adventure—the sirens who lured men to their doom, the one-eyed **Cyclops** who imprisoned Odysseus, the enchantress Circe—can be studied as myth while also exploring what these stories reveal about Greek values, fears, and beliefs.

At the end of this period, **Dorian invasions** plunged the Greek world into turmoil for several centuries—the Greek "Dark Ages" that followed the collapse of Bronze Age civilisations.

### Period 2: The Archaic Age (c. 850–600 BC)

During this period, Ancient Greece slowly emerged from its dark ages. Several significant features appeared:

#### Establishment of City-States
Individual **poleis** were established throughout the Greek world, each with its capital and surrounding territory. The competitive relationship between these city-states shaped Greek history for centuries.

#### Greek Colonisation
Greek city-states established colonies on the Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts, spreading Greek culture and increasing trade. This colonisation movement brought Greeks into contact with diverse peoples and cultures, from Egypt to the Black Sea.

#### The Olympic Games
According to tradition, the Olympic Games began in **776 BC**. They involved male athletes from the whole Hellenic world competing at Olympia in honour of Zeus. The games occurred every four years (an **Olympiad**), providing a calendar system used across the Greek world.

#### The Birth of Greek Literature
**Homer** (if he existed) wrote the **Iliad** and the **Odyssey** during this period. These were old traditional Greek stories of the heroic past, now written down for the first time using the Greek alphabet—adapted from Phoenician sources.

#### Early Scientific Thinking
Greek scientific thinking appeared; in **585 BC**, **Thales** predicted an eclipse of the sun, demonstrating the Greek commitment to understanding natural phenomena through observation and reason rather than purely mythological explanation.

### Period 3: The Classical Golden Age (c. 500–400 BC)

This century marked the height of Ancient Greek civilisation and power, particularly in Athens. The two most powerful Greek city-states, Athens and Sparta, dominated the period.

#### The Persian Wars
Two invasions of the Greek mainland by the **Persian Empire** shaped Greek identity and military reputation:

**The First Invasion (490 BC):** Under **Darius**, the Persians were defeated by a far smaller Athenian army at the **Battle of Marathon**. Tradition has it that **Pheidippides** ran the first marathon when he brought news of the victory to Athens.

**The Second Invasion (480–479 BC):** Under **Xerxes**, this invasion produced two iconic events:
- **The Battle of Thermopylae**: 300 Spartans defended a pass against Xerxes' vast armies until betrayed by a traitor, fighting to the death and delaying the invasion
- **The Battle of Salamis**: Athenians tricked the Persian fleet and crushed them in a narrow strait

#### The Rise of Athenian Democracy
Having repelled the Persians, Athens developed its democratic constitution under **Cleisthenes** and later **Pericles**. Athenian democracy—while excluding women, slaves, and foreign residents—represented an unprecedented experiment in citizen self-governance. Key features included:
- The **Assembly** (**Ekklesia**), where all male citizens could vote on laws and policy
- The **Council of 500** (**Boule**), chosen by lot to prepare Assembly business
- **Ostracism**, a procedure for temporarily exiling powerful individuals
- **Pay for public service**, enabling poorer citizens to participate

#### The Peloponnesian War
The rivalry between Athens and Sparta eventually led to the **Peloponnesian War** (431–404 BC), a devastating conflict that weakened the Greek city-states and left them vulnerable to external conquest.

### Period 4: Alexander and the Hellenistic Age (c. 336–323 BC)

**Alexander the Great** transformed the Greek world through unprecedented military conquest:
- He conquered the Persian Empire, Egypt, and pushed into India
- He founded cities, including **Alexandria** in Egypt
- He spread Greek language, culture, and ideas across a vast empire
- His early death (age 32) led to the division of his empire among his generals

The period following Alexander's death is called the **Hellenistic Age**, characterised by the spread of Greek culture across the Near East and the fusion of Greek, Egyptian, Persian, and other traditions.

## Athens vs Sparta: A Tale of Two City-States

The contrast between Athens and Sparta provides one of the most fruitful topics for primary history study, illuminating how the same cultural foundation produced radically different social systems.

### Athens: Democracy and Culture

Athenian society valued:
- **Political participation**: Male citizens were expected to participate in Assembly debates
- **Education** (for boys): A broad curriculum including reading, writing, mathematics, music, and gymnastics
- **Public debate**: Rhetoric and argumentation were highly valued skills
- **The arts**: Drama, sculpture, and architecture flourished
- **Philosophy**: Thinkers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle developed ideas that still influence Western thought

However, Athenian democracy had significant limitations:
- Women had no political rights and limited legal independence
- Slavery was widespread and economically essential
- Foreign residents (**metics**) could not participate in politics
- Only about 10–20% of the population were citizens with political rights

### Sparta: Military Discipline

Spartan society was organised around producing and maintaining a powerful army:
- **Agoge**: The state-run education system subjected boys to rigorous physical training from age 7
- **Communal living**: Adult male citizens lived in barracks, eating communal meals
- **Military values**: Courage, discipline, and sacrifice for the state were paramount
- **Women's status**: Spartan women had greater freedom and legal rights than Athenian women, primarily because they needed to manage estates while men were at war
- **Helots**: The enslaved population of conquered Messenia provided the economic foundation for Spartan militarism

### Classroom Approaches

The Athens vs Sparta comparison works effectively with primary pupils through:
- **Decision-making activities**: Where would you rather live? (challenging pupils to weigh different values)
- **Role-play**: Assembly debates in Athens, military training in Sparta
- **Source analysis**: Examining how different writers (often Athenian) portrayed Spartan society
- **Modern comparisons**: Discussing how societies make different choices about what they value

## Democracy: Origins and Legacy

### Athenian Democratic Institutions

The development of democracy in Athens represents one of the most significant legacies of Ancient Greece. Understanding how Athenian democracy worked—and its limitations—provides essential context for studying modern democratic systems.

**Key institutions included:**
- The **Assembly** (**Ekklesia**): All male citizens could attend, speak, and vote
- The **Council of 500** (**Boule**): Prepared Assembly agenda; members chosen by lot for one-year terms
- The **People's Courts** (**Dikasteria**): Juries of citizens (201–6,001 members depending on case) decided legal cases
- **Magistrates**: Most positions filled by lot; ten **strategoi** (generals) were elected
- **Ostracism**: Annual vote to exile a prominent figure for ten years (without dishonour)

### Democratic Participation

Participation was direct rather than representative:
- Citizens voted personally on laws and policies
- Juries decided legal cases without judges
- Selection by lot ensured ordinary citizens held office
- Pay for public service enabled poorer citizens to participate

However, Athenian democracy was radically exclusive by modern standards:
- **Women** were entirely excluded from political life
- **Slaves** (perhaps 30% of the population) had no rights
- **Foreign residents** (**metics**) could not participate despite living permanently in Athens
- **Citizenship** was restricted to those with two Athenian parents

### The Legacy for Modern Democracy

The influence of Ancient Greek democracy on modern systems is complex and contested:

**Direct influences include:**
- The vocabulary of democracy (Greek *demokratia*: rule by the people)
- The concept of citizenship as active participation
- The idea of political equality among citizens (*isonomia*)
- Civic education as preparation for democratic participation

**Important differences:**
- Modern democracies are representative, not direct
- Universal suffrage includes women and all adults
- Constitutional protections for minorities
- Separation of powers and judicial independence

The Historical Association's Ancient Greek Government lesson suggests using the creation of **ostracons** (pottery shards used for voting in ostracism) as a practical way to help pupils understand how democratic participation worked in practice.

## Greek Myths and Religion

### The Pantheon and Religious Practice

Greek religion was polytheistic, with a pantheon of gods and goddesses living on **Mount Olympus** under the rule of **Zeus**. Major deities included:
- **Zeus**: King of the gods, god of the sky and thunder
- **Hera**: Queen of the gods, goddess of marriage
- **Poseidon**: God of the sea, earthquakes, and horses
- **Athena**: Goddess of wisdom, warfare, and crafts; patron of Athens
- **Apollo**: God of music, prophecy, healing, and the sun
- **Artemis**: Goddess of the hunt and the moon
- **Ares**: God of war
- **Aphrodite**: Goddess of love and beauty
- **Hermes**: Messenger of the gods
- **Hephaestus**: God of fire and metalworking
- **Demeter**: Goddess of agriculture
- **Dionysus**: God of wine and theatre

Religious practice centred on:
- **Temples**: Houses for the gods containing cult statues
- **Altars**: Located outside temples for sacrifices
- **Festivals**: Including the Olympic Games (honouring Zeus) and the Panathenaea (honouring Athena)
- **Oracles**: Especially the Oracle of **Apollo at Delphi**
- **Mystery cults**: Offering initiation and afterlife hopes

### Myths as Historical Sources

Greek myths present both opportunities and challenges for primary history teaching:

**Opportunities:**
- Engaging narratives that capture pupils' imagination
- Reflection of Greek values, fears, and beliefs
- Cultural explanations for natural phenomena
- Illustrations of moral dilemmas and ethical questions

**Challenges:**
- Distinction between myth and historical fact must be carefully maintained
- Some myths contain violence and themes requiring sensitive handling
- Risk of reinforcing stereotypes about "the Greeks" as purely mythological

The Primary Ancient Greeks website notes that myths are frequently seen as parallel to, rather than integral to, the study of Ancient Greece. Effective teaching integrates myth study with understanding of historical context—examining what myths reveal about Greek society rather than treating them merely as stories.

### Common Myths and Their Teaching Potential

**Theseus and the Minotaur**: Offers opportunities to discuss:
- Archaeological evidence for Minoan civilisation at Knossos
- The legend of King Minos and its possible historical basis
- How myths encode historical memories

**Perseus and Medusa**: Can explore:
- Heroic quest narratives
- The role of divine assistance in Greek thought
- Representations in Greek art

**Persephone and the Seasons**: Enables discussion of:
- Greek explanations for natural phenomena
- The cult of Demeter and agricultural cycles
- The underworld in Greek belief

## The Greek Legacy: Lasting Influence

### Language and Literature

The Greek language has profoundly influenced English and other European languages:
- **Vocabulary**: Thousands of English words derive from Greek roots (democracy, philosophy, theatre, mathematics, biology, geography)
- **Alphabet**: The Greek alphabet adapted Phoenician letters and was later adapted by the Romans for the Latin alphabet we use today
- **Literature**: Epic poetry, tragedy, comedy, and historiography were Greek inventions that established genres still practised
- **Scientific terminology**: Modern scientific vocabulary overwhelmingly uses Greek and Latin roots

### Architecture and Art

Greek architectural forms have been imitated throughout Western history:
- **The orders**: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian column styles remain influential in public buildings
- **The Parthenon**: Symbol of classical proportion and democratic achievement
- **Theatre design**: Greek amphitheatres established principles of acoustics and sightlines still used
- **Sculptural ideals**: Greek concepts of proportion and naturalism influenced Renaissance and later art

### Philosophy and Science

Greek thinkers established questions and methods that still shape intellectual inquiry:
- **Socratic method**: Questioning assumptions through dialogue
- **Aristotelian logic**: Systematic reasoning and categorisation
- **Scientific inquiry**: The Presocratics began naturalistic explanations of the world
- **Mathematical proof**: Greek mathematicians established the standard of rigorous demonstration

### Political Thought

Beyond democracy itself, Greek political thought established frameworks for understanding:
- **Citizenship**: What it means to participate in self-governing communities
- **Justice**: Competing conceptions from Plato, Aristotle, and others
- **Ethics**: Questions of virtue, happiness, and the good life
- **Constitutional analysis**: Comparing different systems of government

### Olympic Heritage

The modern Olympic Games, revived in 1896, consciously reference their ancient Greek origins:
- The Olympic flame is lit at Olympia using a parabolic mirror
- The relay carries flame from Greece to the host city
- The ideals of peaceful competition among nations echo ancient aspirations

However, teachers should help pupils recognise significant differences:
- Ancient Games were exclusively for Greek males
- Only one winner was recognised (no second or third places)
- Athletic competition was closely tied to religious ritual
- Professional athletes existed and were celebrated

## Pedagogical Approaches for Primary Teaching

### Enquiry-Based Learning

The Historical Association and Keystage History both recommend structuring Ancient Greece units around enquiry questions that engage pupils in historical thinking:

**Example enquiries:**
- What can pottery tell us about Ancient Greek life?
- Was Alexander really "Great"?
- Why was tiny Athens able to beat mighty Persia?
- What did the Greeks do for us?
- How did the Greeks explain the world?
- Would you rather live in Athens or Sparta?

Each enquiry should involve pupils in handling sources, constructing arguments, and reaching supported conclusions—not merely receiving information.

### Handling Sources

Ancient Greece offers rich opportunities for developing source work skills:

**Material sources:**
- Pottery (everyday life, myths, trade)
- Coins (economy, politics, identity)
- Buildings (architecture, religious practice, civic pride)
- Archaeological sites (layout, daily life, historical change)

**Written sources:**
- Extracts from Herodotus (the "Father of History")
- Plays by Euripides, Sophocles, and Aristophanes
- Speeches from law courts and assemblies
- Inscriptions on stone

Teaching should emphasise that all sources were created for particular purposes and audiences—not neutral windows into the past.

### Role-Play and Simulation

The participatory nature of Athenian democracy lends itself to classroom simulation:
- Assembly debates on historical issues (building the Parthenon, going to war)
- Trials using Athenian procedures
- Olympic competitions (modified for classroom use)
- Symposium discussions (adapted appropriately)

Such activities should be carefully structured to ensure historical learning, not merely entertainment.

### Cross-Curricular Connections

Ancient Greece naturally connects to other curriculum areas:
- **Geography**: Mediterranean climate, trade routes, colonisation
- **Science**: Early scientific thinking, Archimedes, the water screw
- **Art and Design**: Greek patterns, pottery painting, temple architecture
- **Drama**: Greek theatre origins, tragedy and comedy conventions
- **English**: Greek root words, mythology in literature, rhetorical techniques
- **Citizenship**: Democratic participation, civic responsibility, rights and responsibilities

### Assessment Opportunities

Effective assessment in Ancient Greece units evaluates both substantive knowledge and disciplinary understanding:

**Substantive assessment might include:**
- Explaining why Athens and Sparta developed differently
- Describing the key features of Athenian democracy
- Identifying Greek legacies in the modern world

**Disciplinary assessment might include:**
- Evaluating the reliability of different sources about the Battle of Marathon
- Explaining why historians disagree about Alexander's legacy
- Recognising anachronism in modern representations of Ancient Greece

The Keystage History Ancient Greece assessment task on "Life for women in Ancient Greece" exemplifies effective assessment—requiring pupils to use evidence to construct an argument about a significant historical question.

## Common Misconceptions and How to Address Them

### Misconception 1: "The Greeks" Were a Unified Nation

**The problem:** Pupils often assume Ancient Greece was a country like modern Britain, with a central government and unified policy.

**Addressing it:**
- Emphasise the city-state structure from the start
- Use maps showing multiple independent poleis
- Compare and contrast Athens and Sparta explicitly
- Discuss the Delian League and Peloponnesian League as alliances, not unified states

### Misconception 2: All Greeks Were Democratic

**The problem:** Pupils may assume democracy characterised all Greek societies.

**Addressing it:**
- Clearly distinguish Athenian democracy from Spartan oligarchy and other systems
- Discuss the limited nature of Athenian democracy (who was excluded)
- Compare Greek systems with modern democratic principles

### Misconception 3: Greek Myths Are Historical Facts

**The problem:** Pupils may not distinguish between mythological narratives and historical events.

**Addressing it:**
- Explicitly teach the distinction between myth, legend, and history
- Use myths as sources for Greek beliefs and values, not historical facts
- Discuss archaeological evidence for events like the Trojan War cautiously
- Encourage critical thinking about what sources can and cannot tell us

### Misconception 4: Ancient Greece Was a "Golden Age" Without Problems

**The problem:** A celebratory approach may obscure slavery, misogyny, and imperialism.

**Addressing it:**
- Include critical perspectives on Athenian democracy (exclusions, imperialism)
- Discuss the helot system in Sparta honestly
- Examine whose voices are preserved in sources and whose are missing
- Consider how Greek civilisation was built on conquest and enslavement

### Misconception 5: Greek Culture Ended with Alexander or Rome

**The problem:** Pupils may see Greek culture as ending in antiquity rather than continuing and transforming.

**Addressing it:**
- Discuss the Hellenistic period and Greek influence on Rome
- Trace Greek influences through Byzantine civilisation and the Renaissance
- Identify Greek-derived vocabulary and concepts in modern life
- Show how Greek ideas were preserved and transmitted by Arab scholars

## Progression Across Key Stages

### Key Stage 1 (Limited Coverage)

While Ancient Greece is not a statutory topic at KS1, some schools introduce Greek myths as stories:
- Listening to simplified Greek myths
- Identifying Greek origins of some English words
- Basic awareness of the Olympic Games' origins

### Key Stage 2 (Main Study)

**Lower KS2 (Years 3–4):**
- Introduction to Greek myths and what they reveal about beliefs
- Basic understanding of city-states (Athens and Sparta contrast)
- Awareness of Greek legacies (Olympics, democracy, language)
- Simple source work with pottery and artefacts

**Upper KS2 (Years 5–6):**
- More detailed study of specific periods (Bronze Age, Classical, Alexander)
- Deeper engagement with democratic institutions and their limitations
- Critical evaluation of sources and historical evidence
- Extended writing using historical argument
- Recognition of continuity and change in Greek history

### Key Stage 3 Preparation

Pupils moving to KS3 should have:
- Secure understanding that Ancient Greece comprised multiple independent states
- Awareness of the major periods and their characteristics
- Experience handling different types of historical sources
- Understanding of Greek influence on later civilisations
- Critical perspective on the nature and limitations of ancient evidence

## Conclusion

Ancient Greece offers primary teachers one of the richest opportunities for developing both substantive historical knowledge and disciplinary understanding. The abundance of sources—material, textual, and artistic—combined with the profound influence of Greek ideas on modern Western culture, makes this topic both engaging and educationally powerful.

Effective teaching requires careful attention to:
- The distinction between different Greek city-states and their political systems
- The critical evaluation of sources and their limitations
- The contextualisation of Greek achievements within their historical circumstances
- The honest discussion of who was excluded from Greek citizenship and why
- The tracing of Greek influence through to the present day

By approaching Ancient Greece as a complex, contested, and influential civilisation rather than a simple story of achievement, teachers can help pupils develop sophisticated historical thinking that will serve them throughout their education and beyond.
