# Sequencing Principles in History Curriculum Design

## Overview

Curriculum sequencing in history education refers to the deliberate ordering and structuring of content, concepts and disciplinary approaches across a pupil's educational journey. Effective sequencing is not merely about chronology—though temporal ordering matters—but about building layers of knowledge that progressively develop pupils' capacity to think historically. The Ofsted Research Review (2021) identifies careful sequencing as fundamental to pupils' progress in history, emphasising that "at each stage, pupils need more, and more secure, knowledge in order to understand new material."

Sequencing decisions occur at multiple levels: the ordering of units across key stages; the selection and emphasis of content within topics; and the micro-decisions teachers make during lessons about what knowledge to prioritise. Each level demands careful consideration of how present learning enables future learning.

## The Interplay Between Substantive and Disciplinary Knowledge

### Defining the Distinction

The distinction between substantive and disciplinary knowledge, popularised by Christine Counsell (2018), has become central to curriculum sequencing debates. **Substantive knowledge** refers to knowledge about the past—the content, events, people and periods pupils study. **Disciplinary knowledge** concerns how historians investigate the past and construct claims, arguments and accounts.

This distinction, drawing on Schwab's work on 'syntactic' and 'substantive' knowledge, reflects a long tradition in history education stretching back to the Schools Council History Project (SCHP) from the 1970s. The SCHP sought to embed the methods and approaches of historical enquiry into classroom practice, establishing a foundation that contemporary sequencing principles build upon.

### Why the Interplay Matters for Sequencing

Curriculum sequencing must account for the complex interplay between these knowledge types. As the Ofsted Research Review notes, "deploying both substantive and disciplinary knowledge in combination is what gives pupils the capacity or skill to construct historical arguments or analyse sources."

Pupils cannot effectively deploy disciplinary approaches without sufficient substantive knowledge of the period being studied. Conversely, substantive knowledge only becomes genuinely historical when shaped by disciplinary understanding. This interdependence has profound implications for sequencing:

- **Topics must be sequenced to build sufficient substantive foundations** before requiring complex disciplinary application
- **Disciplinary concepts require repeated encounters** across different substantive contexts to develop sophistication
- **Neither knowledge type can be developed in isolation** without producing superficial understanding

Kate Hammond's research (2014) demonstrated this through analysis of pupils' essays, showing how the strongest historical arguments drew on "layers of knowledge" about the past. Weak essays often resulted from attempts to teach examination skills without the foundational knowledge structures that enable sophisticated historical thinking.

### Sequencing Implications

Effective sequencing therefore requires curriculum designers to:

1. **Map substantive prerequisites** for each topic—what knowledge must pupils already possess to access new material meaningfully?
2. **Identify disciplinary progression**—how will pupils' understanding of historical enquiry develop across the curriculum?
3. **Plan for integration**—where will substantive and disciplinary knowledge be developed simultaneously?

## Fingertip and Residue Knowledge

### The Fingertip/Residue Framework

Christine Counsell's distinction between 'fingertip' and 'residue' knowledge provides a crucial framework for sequencing decisions. This framework helps curriculum designers prioritise content based on its function in pupils' learning.

**Fingertip knowledge** is the detailed, secure knowledge pupils need readily accessible for their current topic or task. It includes specific facts, dates, individuals and events that enable pupils to construct historical arguments within a particular context. This knowledge must be secure and well-organised in pupils' minds, reducing demands on working memory and enabling higher-order thinking.

**Residue knowledge** refers to the broader, more durable understandings that remain from in-depth study of topics. This includes broad period knowledge, understanding of institutions, and conceptual frameworks that persist beyond the immediate topic. Counsell describes the core as "a residue—the things that stay, the things that can be captured as proposition."

### Sequencing for Fingertip Knowledge

When sequencing curriculum content, fingertip knowledge requires:

- **Intensive focus within topics**—explicit teaching and regular retrieval to secure memorisation
- **Clear identification of what must be known**—not everything merits fingertip status
- **Connection to outcome tasks**—pupils need this knowledge available for the work they will produce
- **Judicious use of working memory**—too much fingertip demand overwhelms pupils' capacity for analysis

Hammond's research showed the impact of fingertip knowledge on argument quality. Pupils with secure, accessible knowledge of their topic produced more sophisticated written work because they could focus cognitive resources on constructing arguments rather than recalling basic information.

### Sequencing for Residue Knowledge

Residue knowledge develops cumulatively across the curriculum and requires different sequencing approaches:

- **Strategic topic selection**—some topics are chosen specifically for their capacity to leave rich residue
- **Explicit attention to period characteristics**—ensuring pupils develop broad frameworks for historical periods
- **Return and consolidation**—designing opportunities to revisit and reinforce residual understandings
- **Connection-making**—helping pupils see how residue from earlier topics informs new learning

The residue from a detailed study of the Norman Conquest, for example, might include broad understanding of feudalism, medieval kingship, and the relationship between England and continental Europe—knowledge that proves generative for later medieval topics.

### The Relationship Between Fingertip and Residue

Effective sequencing recognises that fingertip and residue are not rigid categories but exist on a continuum. Some knowledge moves from fingertip to residue as pupils progress through the curriculum. What requires intensive focus in Year 7 may become assumed background knowledge by Year 9.

Curriculum designers must therefore:
- Anticipate what residue earlier topics should leave
- Plan how that residue will function as enabling knowledge for later topics
- Avoid excessive fingertip demands that leave insufficient residue
- Ensure residue accumulates in coherent, connected ways

## Generative Knowledge and Core Content

### Defining Generative Knowledge

Generative knowledge is knowledge that enables future learning. As the Ofsted Research Review states, "knowledge is generative: it enables further learning." This principle should guide sequencing decisions at every level.

Generative knowledge has several characteristics:
- It provides frameworks for understanding new material
- It reduces cognitive load when encountering new content
- It enables pupils to make connections between different topics
- It supports increasingly sophisticated disciplinary application

### Categories of Generative Knowledge

#### Substantive Concepts

Abstract concepts such as invasion, empire, revolution, monarchy and trade are highly generative because pupils encounter them repeatedly across different contexts. Planned, systematic encounters with these concepts support progress.

Effective sequencing requires:
- **Identification of high-frequency concepts**—which concepts appear across multiple topics?
- **Planned progression**—how will understanding of 'empire' develop from Year 7 to Year 11?
- **Historicisation**—ensuring pupils understand how concepts have specific meanings in particular periods
- **Integration with disciplinary knowledge**—understanding how historians use and contest concepts

The concept of 'revolution', for instance, carries different connotations in the French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, and the Russian Revolution. Sequencing must provide encounters that build sophisticated, nuanced understanding rather than simplistic definitions.

#### Chronological Knowledge

Understanding the broad characteristics of historical periods provides essential context for new learning. A pupil who knows the general features of the medieval period will more readily learn about specific medieval events.

Sequencing for chronological knowledge requires attention to:
- **Mental timeline development**—building pupils' capacity to locate periods and events in temporal relation to each other
- **Overview and depth balance**—ensuring pupils develop both broad period knowledge and detailed topic understanding
- **Cumulative narrative construction**—helping pupils build coherent stories across the curriculum

Banham's concept of "the overview lurking in the depth" suggests that detailed study of specific topics can simultaneously develop broad chronological understanding. A deep study of King John's reign, properly sequenced and taught, builds understanding of medieval kingship, feudal structures, and the relationship between crown and nobility that transfers to other medieval topics.

#### Vocabulary and Language Knowledge

The vocabulary of history—including technical terms, anachronistic concepts, and disciplinary language—is highly generative. Pupils who develop rich historical vocabularies can access more complex texts and engage more readily with historical argument.

Sequencing for vocabulary development requires:
- **Systematic introduction** of key terms at appropriate points
- **Repeated encounters** in varied contexts
- **Attention to changing meanings** of terms across periods
- **Integration with reading and discussion** opportunities

### Identifying Core Knowledge

Core knowledge is the subset of content that curriculum designers and teachers identify as particularly important for pupils to secure. No content is innately 'core'—the status reflects curricular decisions about what will best enable future learning.

Core knowledge identification requires:
- **Analysis of future curriculum demands**—what knowledge will pupils need?
- **Consideration of disciplinary progression**—what enables increasingly sophisticated historical thinking?
- **Recognition of enabling concepts**—what vocabulary and frameworks unlock further learning?
- **Attention to assessment requirements**—what knowledge supports examination success?

Sequencing decisions should reflect clear rationales for why particular content is designated as core, how it will be secured, and how it functions to enable later learning.

## The Role of Hinterland

### Defining Hinterland

The 'hinterland' refers to the rich contextual and background content that surrounds core knowledge. While curriculum designers identify specific 'core' knowledge they want pupils to secure, effective sequencing recognises that pupils often need extensive hinterland to make sense of that core.

As Counsell warns, there is danger in reducing content to propositions, rendering it less meaningful and less learnable. The hinterland provides the meaningful examples, stories, and contextual details that make abstract ideas concrete and memorable.

### Functions of Hinterland in Sequencing

#### Providing Meaningful Examples

Abstract concepts become learnable when encountered through specific, meaningful examples. Hinterland content provides these examples in abundance. A lesson on monasticism might include vivid details about life on Holy Island, the story of Hilda of Whitby, and descriptions of medieval manuscripts—not because pupils must memorise these specifics, but because they make the concept of 'monastery' meaningful and memorable.

Sequencing implications:
- **Rich topic selection**—some topics naturally provide richer hinterland than others
- **Story and narrative inclusion**—human-scale stories make abstract ideas accessible
- **Sensory and emotive detail**—descriptions that engage imagination support memory

#### Connecting and Organising Knowledge

Hinterland helps organise knowledge into coherent narratives. Stories provide frameworks that connect disparate facts into meaningful wholes. The narrative of Augustine's mission to Kent, with its details of Queen Bertha, King Aethelbert's gifts, and the library at Canterbury, connects religious, political and cultural changes into a memorable account.

Sequencing implications:
- **Narrative arcs across topics**—how do topics connect into larger stories?
- **Return to previous narratives**—consolidating understanding through revisiting
- **Multiple narrative threads**—recognising that different stories (political, social, cultural) interweave

#### Establishing Schemata for Future Learning

Hinterland encounters establish initial schemata—mental structures for organising knowledge—that prove essential for later learning. Even brief encounters with rich detail can establish frameworks that enable future comprehension. A Year 5 pupil who hears about the Pope sending books from Rome has begun developing a schema for papal authority that will prove crucial when studying the Reformation in Year 8.

Sequencing implications:
- **Strategic hinterland inclusion**—what brief encounters will pay dividends later?
- **Anticipation of future needs**—identifying what schemata pupils will need
- **Spiralling encounters**—returning to concepts with increasing sophistication

#### Broadening Curriculum Content

Hinterland naturally broadens the curriculum, exposing pupils to diverse experiences, perspectives and aspects of the past that might be omitted from a narrow focus on core content. The story of Hilda of Whitby introduces pupils to the complex roles of women in medieval religion and politics alongside the main narrative of Christian conversion.

Sequencing implications:
- **Diversity through hinterland**—ensuring breadth without losing coherence
- **Multiple perspectives**—using hinterland to introduce varied viewpoints
- **Cultural capital development**—rich cultural knowledge that pupils carry forward

### Balancing Core and Hinterland

Effective sequencing requires thoughtful balance between core and hinterland. Too little hinterland leaves core knowledge abstract and unmemorable; too much risks overwhelming pupils with content they cannot retain. The art of curriculum sequencing lies in identifying what core must be secured, what hinterland enables that security, and what incidental richness enriches understanding without becoming a memorisation burden.

## Spacing, Interleaving and Retrieval Practice

### Evidence from Learning Science

Research in cognitive science provides principles that should inform curriculum sequencing. Three strategies have particularly strong evidence bases: spaced practice, interleaving, and retrieval practice.

**Spaced practice** involves distributing learning across time rather than massing it in single blocks. Studying content in sessions spaced across weeks or months produces stronger long-term retention than equivalent time concentrated in a single session.

**Interleaving** involves mixing different topics or problem types rather than studying them in blocks. Alternating between related concepts produces better learning than studying each concept to completion before moving to the next.

**Retrieval practice** involves actively recalling information from memory rather than re-reading or re-teaching. The act of retrieval strengthens memory and identifies gaps in knowledge.

### Applying Spacing to History Curriculum

Spacing has significant implications for how history content is sequenced and revisited:

#### Topic Spacing

Rather than studying topics in concentrated blocks with no return, effective sequencing builds in spaced revisiting. A topic on the Norman Conquest studied in October might be briefly revisited in January, connected to a medieval England topic in March, and drawn upon for a comparison with the English Civil War in Year 8.

Implementation strategies:
- **Curriculum mapping for spaced return**—identifying where topics will be revisited
- **Low-stakes retrieval activities**—regular brief recall of previous content
- **Horizontal connections**—links between topics studied at different times
- **Vertical progression**—building year-on-year through spaced encounters

#### Concept Spacing

Substantive concepts require spacing across multiple topics. The concept of 'empire' might be encountered in Roman Britain, revisited in medieval contexts, developed through early modern exploration, and sophisticated through study of the British Empire and decolonisation.

Implementation strategies:
- **Concept tracking across curriculum**—mapping where key concepts appear
- **Increasing sophistication**—ensuring later encounters develop rather than repeat understanding
- **Explicit connection-making**—helping pupils recognise conceptual links across topics

#### Assessment Spacing

Formative and summative assessments should be spaced throughout the curriculum rather than concentrated at topic ends. This spacing both implements and reinforces the spacing of content itself.

### Applying Interleaving to History Curriculum

Interleaving—mixing related content types—can enhance learning when applied thoughtfully to history sequencing:

#### Chronological Interleaving

Some curriculum designs interleave topics from different periods to highlight connections and contrasts. For example, alternating between British and world history topics, or between political and social history perspectives.

Implementation considerations:
- **Thematic organisation**—structuring around themes that span periods
- **Comparison opportunities**—interleaving enables direct comparison between periods
- **Risk of fragmentation**—interleaving must not prevent coherent period understanding
- **Chronological integrity**—ensuring pupils still develop secure mental timelines

#### Disciplinary Interleaving

Sequencing might interleave different types of disciplinary thinking—alternating between evidence evaluation, causation analysis, and interpretation assessment. This develops flexible disciplinary capability rather than topic-specific skills.

Implementation strategies:
- **Explicit disciplinary focus**—identifying the disciplinary thinking being developed
- **Varied contexts**—applying disciplinary approaches across different periods
- **Cumulative sophistication**—building disciplinary complexity across interleaved encounters

### Retrieval Practice in Sequencing

Retrieval practice should be built into curriculum sequencing at multiple levels:

#### Within Lessons

- **Regular low-stakes quizzing**—brief recall activities that strengthen memory
- **'Do now' activities**—starting lessons with retrieval of prior relevant knowledge
- **Cold calling**—requiring all pupils to retrieve and share knowledge

#### Across Topics

- **Inter-topic retrieval**—recalling knowledge from previous topics when starting new ones
- **Cumulative quizzing**—quizzes that draw on content from across the year or key stage
- **Connection prompts**—asking pupils to recall how current topics relate to previous study

#### Whole Curriculum

- **Regular spaced retrieval**—building retrieval of earlier content into later topics
- **Synoptic opportunities**—assessment and activities requiring knowledge from across the curriculum
- **Knowledge organisers**—providing reference points for retrieval practice

Sequencing must build in time for retrieval practice and ensure that content studied early remains accessible for retrieval as the curriculum progresses.

## Chronological Sequencing and Progression

### The Chronological Principle

A foundational sequencing principle in history education is the development of pupils' chronological understanding. The National Curriculum requires pupils to develop "a chronologically secure knowledge and understanding of British, local and world history."

Chronological sequencing involves more than simply studying topics in date order. It requires developing what Dawson calls a "mental timeline"—a coherent framework for locating periods, events and developments in temporal relation to each other.

### Building the Mental Timeline

Effective chronological sequencing develops several components:

#### Period Characteristics

Pupils need broad understanding of the characteristics that define historical periods. What makes 'the medieval period' distinct? What are the defining features of the 'early modern' era? Sequencing should ensure pupils develop these frameworks through both explicit overview teaching and implicit absorption through in-depth study.

Implementation strategies:
- **Period introductions**—explicit teaching of period characteristics at key points
- **In-depth studies that illuminate periods**—topics chosen to exemplify broader period features
- **Return and consolidation**—revisiting period characteristics as pupils develop more knowledge
- **Period comparisons**—helping pupils distinguish between periods by comparing features

#### Chronological Vocabulary

Pupils need language for talking about time: centuries, decades, BC/AD (or BCE/CE), duration, and relative terms (before, after, during, meanwhile). Sequencing should introduce and reinforce this vocabulary progressively.

Implementation strategies:
- **Explicit vocabulary instruction**—teaching time-related terms systematically
- **Regular use in context**—using chronological vocabulary in teaching and questioning
- **Visual timeline work**—supporting understanding through visual representation
- **Increasing precision**—developing from broad (medieval period) to specific (1215)

#### Narrative Coherence

The mental timeline is not merely a list of dates but a network of connected narratives. Sequencing should help pupils build stories that connect periods and developments.

Implementation strategies:
- **Narrative arcs**—identifying stories that span multiple topics
- **Causal chains**—showing how one development led to another
- **Thematic threads**—tracing themes (democracy, empire, technology) across periods
- **Local-national-global connections**—linking scales of history

### Sequencing Approaches

#### Chronological Curriculum

The most common sequencing approach follows chronological order: ancient, medieval, early modern, modern. This approach:
- Builds period knowledge progressively
- Develops the mental timeline naturally
- Enables causal and developmental narratives
- Supports understanding of change over time

However, chronologically sequenced curricula risk:
- Assuming without checking that pupils have retained prior knowledge
- Treating topics as isolated blocks rather than connected stories
- Failing to revisit and consolidate earlier periods

#### Thematic Curriculum

Some curricula are organised thematically, studying topics from different periods that illuminate particular themes. This approach:
- Highlights connections across periods
- Enables depth on particular topics
- Can engage pupils through relevance

However, thematic sequencing requires:
- Careful attention to building period knowledge
- Explicit work on the mental timeline
- Avoidance of assuming knowledge pupils have not yet developed

#### Mixed Approaches

Many effective curricula combine chronological and thematic elements, using chronology as the spine while incorporating thematic depth studies or cross-period comparisons.

### Progression in Chronological Understanding

Sequencing should reflect progression in how pupils understand chronology:

**Early Years and Key Stage 1:**
- Understanding that the past is different from the present
- Developing vocabulary for time (yesterday, long ago, old, new)
- Sequencing events within living memory
- Beginning to place events on simple timelines

**Key Stage 2:**
- Developing broader period knowledge (Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings, etc.)
- Understanding that periods have characteristics
- Placing studied topics on a developing timeline
- Using century dates and AD/BC appropriately

**Key Stage 3:**
- Building coherent period frameworks
- Understanding that periods are constructed and debated
- Making connections across periods
- Developing overview knowledge alongside depth study

**Key Stage 4 and 5:**
- Sophisticated period understanding
- Critical engagement with periodisation
- Synoptic understanding connecting multiple topics
- Understanding historiographical debates about period boundaries

## Differentiation and Adaptive Sequencing

### Sequencing for Diverse Learners

Effective sequencing must account for the diverse needs of pupils, including those with special educational needs, those learning English as an additional language, and those with gaps in prior knowledge.

#### Foundational Knowledge

All pupils need secure foundational knowledge to access new content. Sequencing should:
- Identify prerequisite knowledge for each topic
- Assess whether pupils have this knowledge
- Build in time to address gaps where needed
- Avoid assuming knowledge that may not be secure

#### Adaptive Pathways

While all pupils study the same curriculum, sequencing can allow for:
- **Different depths of study**—all pupils encounter topics, but some go deeper
- **Additional scaffolding**—extra support for pupils who need it
- **Enrichment extensions**—additional challenge for pupils ready for it
- **Retrieval priorities**—particular focus on securing core knowledge for some pupils

#### Language and Literacy

History sequencing must account for the significant literacy demands of the subject:
- **Vocabulary introduction**—systematic teaching of historical terms
- **Reading development**—progression in text complexity across the curriculum
- **Writing support**—developing historical writing progressively
- **Oral foundations**—developing understanding through discussion before writing

### Sequencing for Pupils with SEND

Pupils with special educational needs may require:
- **Additional repetition**—more encounters with key concepts
- **Explicit instruction**—clear teaching of routines and approaches
- **Scaffolded materials**—modified resources that maintain rigour
- **Additional time**—longer sequences for securing knowledge

Sequencing should build in these opportunities without creating separate curricula that limit aspiration.

---

## Assessment and Sequencing

### Assessment Purposes in Sequenced Curricula

Assessment in a well-sequenced curriculum serves multiple purposes:

#### Diagnostic Assessment

Identifying what pupils already know before beginning new topics:
- **Prior knowledge checks**—assessing prerequisites
- **Misconception identification**—finding gaps or errors in existing knowledge
- **Starting point determination**—adapting teaching based on assessment

#### Formative Assessment

Monitoring learning during sequences to adapt teaching:
- **Regular retrieval practice**—checking knowledge retention
- **Application tasks**—seeing if pupils can use knowledge in new contexts
- **Questioning**—using questions to probe understanding
- **Responsive teaching**—adjusting sequences based on assessment

#### Summative Assessment

Evaluating learning at key points:
- **End of topic assessments**—checking what has been learned
- **Cumulative assessments**—drawing on knowledge from across sequences
- **Standards monitoring**—tracking whether pupils are meeting expectations

### Assessment Design Principles

Assessments in sequenced curricula should:
- **Sample from the sequence**—test what has been taught in the order taught
- **Require integration**—assess how pupils connect knowledge across topics
- **Build progressively**—increase demand as the curriculum progresses
- **Support retrieval**—provide opportunities to strengthen memory

---

## Practical Implementation

### Curriculum Mapping

Effective sequencing requires comprehensive curriculum mapping:

1. **Content audit**—what knowledge will pupils encounter?
2. **Prerequisite mapping**—what must be known before each topic?
3. **Concept tracking**—where do key concepts appear across the curriculum?
4. **Progression mapping**—how does complexity increase?
5. **Assessment mapping**—where and how will learning be checked?

### Documentation

Sequencing decisions should be documented to support:
- **Shared understanding**—ensuring all teachers understand the rationale
- **Departmental coherence**—maintaining consistency across classes
- **Induction of new staff**—helping new teachers understand the curriculum
- **Review and refinement**—enabling ongoing improvement

### Review and Adaptation

Sequencing is not fixed. Regular review should consider:
- **Assessment outcomes**—are pupils learning what was intended?
- **Teacher feedback**—what is working well and what needs adjustment?
- **Pupil feedback**—how do pupils experience the sequence?
- **External developments**—new research, resources or requirements

---

## Conclusion

Sequencing is the backbone of effective history curriculum design. It determines not just what pupils learn, but how their knowledge develops, connects, and enables future learning. The principles outlined in this document—attention to substantive and disciplinary knowledge interplay, fingertip and residue knowledge, generative content, hinterland, spacing and retrieval, chronological progression, and adaptive teaching—provide a framework for designing curricula that build pupils' historical understanding progressively and coherently.

The Ofsted Research Review (2021) captures the essence of effective sequencing: "At each stage, pupils need more, and more secure, knowledge in order to understand new material." Every sequencing decision should be evaluated against this principle. Does the ordering of content ensure that pupils have the knowledge they need to access new material? Does the curriculum build cumulatively, with each topic leaving residue that enables future learning? Does the sequence develop both breadth and depth, overview and detail?

Effective sequencing transforms a collection of topics into a coherent educational experience that progressively develops pupils' capacity to think historically, understand the past, and engage with the complexity of human experience across time.
