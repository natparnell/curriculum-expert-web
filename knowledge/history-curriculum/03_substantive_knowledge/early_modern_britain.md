# Early Modern Britain (c. 1500–1750)

## Overview

Early Modern Britain spans approximately 250 years from the accession of Henry VII in 1485 to the end of the Stuart period and the Glorious Revolution of 1688. This era witnessed profound transformations in British society, politics, religion, and culture that laid the foundations for the modern nation-state. The period encompasses the Tudor dynasty (1485–1603), the Stuart era (1603–1714), and the critical transitional decades that followed.

The National Curriculum for history identifies Early Modern Britain as a significant area of study at both Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3. Pupils encounter this period through topics including the Tudors, the English Civil War, the Great Fire of London, and the transatlantic slave trade. Understanding the chronological framework, key turning points, and substantive concepts of this era is essential for effective curriculum design and pedagogical practice.

## Historical Overview and Chronology

### The Tudor Period (1485–1603)

#### Establishment of Tudor Rule

Henry VII's victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 ended the Wars of the Roses and established the Tudor dynasty. His reign focused on consolidating royal authority, restoring financial stability, and establishing the foundations of a centralised state. The Historical Association notes that Henry VII's methods of government, whilst less dramatic than his son's, established crucial precedents for strong monarchical rule.

#### The Reformation and Religious Transformation

Henry VIII's break with Rome (1533–1536) represents one of the most significant religious and political transformations in British history. The dissolution of the monasteries redistributed vast wealth and land, fundamentally altering the social and economic landscape. English Heritage emphasises that this period was "a time of great social and religious change in England" that reshaped the relationship between crown, church, and people.

The succession of Edward VI (1547–1553) saw the acceleration of Protestant reform, whilst Mary I's brief reign (1553–1558) attempted to restore Catholicism. Elizabeth I's religious settlement (1559) established a via media that, whilst pragmatically motivated, created a distinctive English Protestant identity that would have profound consequences for national identity and foreign relations.

#### Elizabethan England and the Defeat of the Armada

Elizabeth I's reign (1558–1603) is often characterised as a golden age, though historians caution against uncritical celebration. The defeat of the Spanish Armada (1588) became a foundational myth of English Protestant identity. However, Ofsted's research review series (2021) emphasises the importance of teaching pupils that historical narratives require critical examination—Elizabethan England also featured poverty, political surveillance, and religious persecution.

### The Stuart Period (1603–1714)

#### Union of the Crowns and Emerging Tensions

James VI of Scotland's accession as James I of England in 1603 created a personal union of the crowns. The Stuart period is marked by increasing tensions between monarch and Parliament, religious divisions, and ultimately civil war. Thinking History, a widely respected resource for history teachers, argues that teaching the Civil War requires looking beyond the immediate narrative of causes and outcomes to consider "how can this narrow focus on the 1640s relate to KS3 History as a course."

#### The English Civil Wars and Interregnum

The English Civil Wars (1642–1651) represent a fundamental rupture in British political history. The execution of Charles I (1649) and the establishment of a republic under Oliver Cromwell challenged fundamental assumptions about kingship and authority. The National Archives provides excellent teaching resources using original documents that "tell the story" of this period, enabling pupils to engage with primary sources directly.

The Restoration of Charles II (1660) restored the monarchy but within changed parameters of constitutional understanding. The Great Plague (1665) and Great Fire of London (1666) marked this period with dramatic events that feature prominently in primary curricula.

#### The Glorious Revolution and Constitutional Settlement

The Glorious Revolution (1688) and the subsequent Bill of Rights (1689) established parliamentary supremacy and limited monarchy. This settlement provided the constitutional framework that would guide British political development through the eighteenth century and beyond.

## Key Themes and Substantive Concepts

### Monarchy and Political Authority

The Early Modern period offers rich opportunities to explore how political authority was conceived, challenged, and transformed. Pupils can trace the development from Henry VII's consolidation of royal power through the divine right theories of the Stuarts to the constitutional monarchy established after 1688. The Historical Association's teaching resources emphasise the value of examining "how the monarchy is presented in the media today" as well as in historical sources, enabling pupils to make connections between past and present.

### Religious Change and Conflict

Religion permeated every aspect of Early Modern life. The shift from Catholicism through various Protestant settlements created ongoing tensions that manifested in rebellion, persecution, and civil war. Teaching this theme requires sensitivity to the genuine convictions of historical actors whilst avoiding sectarian partisanship. English Heritage advises that teachers "chart the monumental changes to society" whilst recognising that religious identity was inseparable from political and social identity.

### Social and Economic Transformation

The period witnessed significant social and economic change: population growth followed by stagnation, enclosure and agrarian change, the growth of London, and the beginnings of colonial expansion and the transatlantic slave trade. The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge's establishment of charity schools in this period, as noted in educational histories, reflects growing recognition of the need for mass education—albeit with religious and social control objectives.

### Cultural and Intellectual Developments

The Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, and the flourishing of English literature (Shakespeare, Milton) all occurred within this period. These developments can be connected to broader themes of change and continuity, helping pupils understand that intellectual and cultural history interacts with political and social developments.

## Curriculum Progression Across Key Stages

### Key Stage 1 (Ages 5–7)

At Key Stage 1, the National Curriculum specifies events beyond living memory that are significant nationally or globally. The Great Fire of London (1666) is the most commonly taught Early Modern topic at this stage. The Historical Association recommends using Samuel Pepys as a "famous person" through which to explore this event, combining the study of a significant individual with a major historical event.

**Teaching approaches for Key Stage 1:**

- Use stories and role-play to engage young children with historical events
- Focus on concrete, sensory details (the heat of the fire, the narrow streets)
- Introduce the concept of sources through Pepys' diary extracts
- Make connections to local environments where possible

### Key Stage 2 (Ages 7–11)

Key Stage 2 pupils study "a study of an aspect or theme in British history that extends pupils' chronological knowledge beyond 1066." Many schools choose a Tudor topic to fulfil this requirement. The topic might be organised around a study of monarchs (Henry VIII, Elizabeth I), everyday life, or a specific event like the Spanish Armada.

Keystage History notes that the focus in many classrooms is "80% on Henry VIII and Elizabeth focusing on their portraits and what they tell us about them as rulers." Whilst this approach has value, teachers should ensure pupils develop chronological understanding of the whole period and encounter diverse historical perspectives.

**Teaching approaches for Key Stage 2:**

- Develop secure chronological understanding through timelines and sequencing activities
- Use enquiry questions to structure learning (e.g., "Was Henry VIII a good king?")
- Introduce historical interpretation through examining different portrayals of monarchs
- Engage with primary sources including portraits, inventories, and eyewitness accounts
- Address common misconceptions directly (see below)

### Key Stage 3 (Ages 11–14)

At Key Stage 3, the National Curriculum requires "ideas, political power, industry and empire: Britain, 1745–1901" and provides flexibility to include earlier periods. Many schools include the Civil War and Interregnum as part of their Key Stage 3 curriculum, either as a discrete unit or as part of a longer thematic study.

Oak National Academy provides comprehensive resources for teaching the English Civil War at Key Stage 3, including lessons on "what can pamphlets tell us about 17th century politics." This approach exemplifies the disciplinary focus on using sources as evidence that Ofsted (2021) identifies as crucial for quality history education.

**Teaching approaches for Key Stage 3:**

- Develop sophisticated understanding of causation through examining multiple factors
- Engage with historical interpretations and debates (e.g., causes of the Civil War)
- Use rich source work to develop pupils' disciplinary understanding
- Make explicit connections to earlier and later periods to develop chronological frameworks
- Address the transition from medieval to modern mentalities

## Common Misconceptions and Teaching Strategies

### Misconception 1: Henry VIII broke with Rome primarily because he wanted a divorce

Whilst Henry's desire to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon was the immediate trigger, the break with Rome had deeper political, financial, and religious dimensions. Teaching should emphasise that Henry remained theologically conservative and that the dissolution of the monasteries had significant political and economic motivations.

**Addressing the misconception:**
- Present multiple factors and ask pupils to evaluate their relative importance
- Use timelines to show the sequence of events leading to the break
- Examine Henry's writings and religious policies to demonstrate his theological conservatism

### Misconception 2: Elizabeth I was always popular and successful

The "golden age" narrative obscures the genuine difficulties and opposition Elizabeth faced. Her reign included the Northern Rebellion, excommunication by the Pope, ongoing Catholic plots, and significant economic challenges in the 1590s.

**Addressing the misconception:**
- Present evidence of opposition and difficulties alongside achievements
- Ask pupils to evaluate the "golden age" interpretation critically
- Use local examples where possible (e.g., recusancy in particular areas)

### Misconception 3: The English Civil War was simply Roundheads versus Cavaliers

This binary oversimplification masks the complex political, religious, and regional divisions of the period. Not all Parliamentarians were Puritans, not all Royalists were Catholics, and many people attempted to remain neutral.

**Addressing the misconception:**
- Examine the diverse motivations of different groups
- Study regional variations in support for King and Parliament
- Use the "range of change" concept to show how revolutionary (or not) different groups wanted to be

### Misconception 4: The Great Fire of London ended the plague

Whilst the fire did destroy areas where plague had been present, this common misconception conflates correlation with causation. Plague was already declining before the fire due to other factors.

**Addressing the misconception:**
- Use the plague and fire as separate but related enquiries
- Examine the chronology carefully to establish the sequence of events
- Discuss how historical myths develop and persist

### Misconception 5: Life was uniformly hard and unpleasant for everyone

Whilst life expectancy was lower and material conditions harsher than today, Early Modern Britain included periods of relative prosperity, cultural flourishing, and significant social mobility for some.

**Addressing the misconception:**
- Use case studies of individuals from different social backgrounds
- Examine material culture (houses, possessions, clothing) as evidence of living standards
- Discuss the complexity of measuring "quality of life" across historical periods

## Pedagogical Approaches and Classroom Strategies

### Enquiry-Based Learning

Ofsted's research review series (2021) emphasises that "high-quality history education" requires carefully constructed enquiries that develop both substantive and disciplinary knowledge. Early Modern Britain offers rich opportunities for enquiry questions that engage pupils with genuine historical questions:

- "Why did Henry VIII break with Rome?" (causation)
- "Was the defeat of the Armada a turning point?" (significance)
- "How revolutionary was the English Civil War?" (change and continuity)

### Use of Primary Sources

The Early Modern period is exceptionally well-served by surviving sources, including state papers, private letters, visual sources, and printed texts. The National Archives provides extensive educational resources enabling pupils to engage with original documents. When using sources, teachers should:

- Select sources appropriate to pupils' reading levels
- Provide sufficient context for sources to be meaningful
- Teach specific source analysis skills progressively
- Use sources to address genuine historical questions, not merely as illustrations

### Developing Historical Interpretations

The Tudor and Stuart periods have generated significant historical debate that can be introduced to pupils at appropriate levels. Key interpretive debates include:

- The nature of Tudor despotism (Elton's "Tudor Revolution" versus revisionist views)
- Causes of the English Civil War (Whig, Marxist, and revisionist interpretations)
- The significance of the Glorious Revolution

At Key Stage 3, pupils can be introduced to the idea that historians disagree and that interpretations change over time. At Key Stage 2, the focus might be on understanding that historical narratives are constructed rather than simply "what happened."

### Making Connections

Effective history teaching helps pupils make connections between different periods and themes. Early Modern Britain connects to:

- Medieval foundations (continuity in institutions, religious beliefs)
- Empire and transatlantic slavery (colonial expansion begins in this period)
- Industrial Revolution (social and economic foundations laid)
- Modern constitutional arrangements (1688 settlement)

## Assessment and Progression

### Assessing Substantive Knowledge

Assessment should focus on whether pupils have developed secure knowledge of the period that they can use flexibly. Effective approaches include:

- Low-stakes retrieval practice focusing on chronology and key concepts
- Extended writing that requires pupils to use knowledge to address historical questions
- Oral assessment through structured questioning and discussion

### Assessing Disciplinary Understanding

The second order concepts (change and continuity, cause and consequence, similarity and difference, historical significance, and interpretation) can be assessed through tasks that require pupils to apply these concepts to Early Modern content.

### Using Assessment to Inform Teaching

Common assessment evidence might reveal:

- Weaknesses in chronological understanding (confusing Tudor and Stuart monarchs)
- Oversimplified causal explanations
- Difficulty engaging with historical interpretations
- Anachronistic assumptions about past attitudes and beliefs

Such evidence should inform subsequent teaching, with targeted activities designed to address specific gaps.

## Conclusion

Early Modern Britain offers exceptional opportunities for developing pupils' historical knowledge and understanding. The period's dramatic events, well-documented sources, and significant historiographical debates provide rich material for enquiry-based learning across all key stages.

Effective teaching of this period requires secure subject knowledge, awareness of common misconceptions, and careful attention to progression in both substantive and disciplinary understanding. By engaging pupils with genuine historical questions and authentic sources, teachers can develop the sophisticated historical thinking that Ofsted identifies as the hallmark of quality history education.

The transformations of Early Modern Britain—religious, political, social, and cultural—laid foundations for the modern British state. Understanding this period is therefore essential not only for historical education but for informed citizenship in the present.
