# Teaching The Holocaust: Mandatory Content, Pedagogical Approaches and Student Understanding

## Introduction: The Only Compulsory Historical Event

The Holocaust occupies a unique position in the English National Curriculum: **it is the only historical event whose study is compulsory**. Since 1991, all secondary schools in England have been required to teach about the Holocaust as part of the Key Stage 3 History curriculum, typically with students aged 13–14 in Year 9. This mandatory status reflects both the enormity of the event itself and the conviction that understanding this history is essential for all young people.

According to the Holocaust Educational Trust, this requirement makes England distinctive internationally. While many countries include Holocaust education within their curricula, England is unusual in making it a statutory requirement without prescribing specific content or pedagogical approaches. As the UCL Centre for Holocaust Education notes, "learning about the Holocaust has been mandatory in the history curriculum since 1991, but there has never been clarity about what content should be covered, how it should be taught, or even what the purpose of teaching and learning about the Holocaust actually is."

This knowledge file addresses these gaps by examining: the essential historical content that should be taught; the pedagogical principles that underpin effective Holocaust education; the common misconceptions students hold and how to address them; and the professional development resources available to support teachers in this challenging work.

## Historical Content: What Should Be Taught

### Establishing a Clear Chronological Framework

Effective Holocaust education requires a secure chronological understanding. The UCL Centre for Holocaust Education emphasises that "students need a clear chronological framework" to understand how Nazi persecution evolved from discrimination to genocide. Key chronological markers include:

**1933–1938: Discrimination and Disenfranchisement**

Following the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933, the German Jewish population—approximately 500,000 people—faced increasingly systematic discrimination. The April 1933 boycott of Jewish businesses, the dismissal of Jewish civil servants under the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, and the 1935 Nuremberg Laws (which defined Jews racially and stripped them of citizenship rights) established the legal framework for persecution.

Teaching should make clear that antisemitism did not begin with the Nazis. As the USHMM notes, this lesson "focuses on the history of antisemitism and its role in the Holocaust to better understand how prejudice and hate speech can contribute to violence, mass atrocity, and genocide." Students benefit from understanding that Nazi antisemitism drew upon centuries of religious and racial prejudice, even as it developed distinctive genocidal characteristics.

**1938–1941: Escalation and Expansion**

The November 1938 Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass) pogrom marked a significant escalation, with the destruction of synagogues, Jewish-owned businesses and homes across Germany and Austria. Following this, policies of forced emigration intensified. The outbreak of war in September 1939 brought further measures, including the establishment of ghettos in occupied Poland and the introduction of forced labour.

**1941–1945: The Final Solution**

The German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 marked the beginning of systematic mass shooting of Jewish populations by mobile killing squads (Einsatzgruppen). By autumn 1941, Nazi policy had shifted toward the industrialised murder of all European Jews—the "Final Solution to the Jewish Question." The Wannsee Conference of January 1942 coordinated implementation across Nazi-occupied Europe.

Teaching should include awareness of the camp system (concentration camps, labour camps, and killing centres), without focusing exclusively on Auschwitz. As the UCL research indicates, students often know about Auschwitz but have limited understanding of the broader geography of the Holocaust, including killing centres such as Treblinka, Sobibor, and Belzec, and the mass shootings across Eastern Europe.

### Essential Subject Knowledge

**Victims of the Holocaust**

While the Holocaust is defined as the genocide of European Jews, teaching should acknowledge that Nazi persecution targeted multiple groups. The USHMM and IHRA (International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance) define the Holocaust as "the persecution and murder of six million Jews by the Nazi regime and its collaborators," while recognising that "Roma and Sinti, disabled people, Polish civilians, Soviet prisoners of war, gay men, Jehovah's Witnesses and political opponents were also targeted."

However, it is pedagogically important not to subsume the Jewish specificity of the Holocaust within a general narrative of victims. The Final Solution was conceived and implemented primarily as the eradication of European Jewry, with other victims targeted through different logics. Students should understand both the particularity of the genocide against Jews and the wider context of Nazi persecution.

**The Perpetrators**

Teaching should move beyond the stereotype of the perpetrator as merely Hitler or a small group of Nazi leaders. The Holocaust was implemented by thousands of people across multiple nations: SS and police personnel, railway workers, civil servants, industrialists, soldiers, and local collaborators. Understanding that "ordinary" people participated in genocide is challenging but essential for students' moral and historical understanding.

**Geographical Scope**

Students often have limited understanding of where the Holocaust occurred. Teaching should emphasise that the Holocaust took place across Nazi-occupied Europe—not only in Germany and Poland, but also in the Baltic states, Belarus, Ukraine, the Netherlands, France, Greece, Italy, and elsewhere. The UCL research found that many students "struggle with basic questions about what happened, to whom, where and when."

**Responses: Bystanders, Rescuers, and Resistance**

As the Facing History framework suggests, "the terms perpetrator, victim, bystander, upstander, and now rescuer refer not to fixed identities but to the behaviour of individuals, groups, or even nations at specific moments in time." This nuanced understanding helps students avoid simplistic categorisations.

Teaching should include:
- The range of responses from local populations across occupied Europe
- The actions of rescuers and resisters, while avoiding heroic narratives that might suggest rescue was common or easy
- The complexities of bystander behaviour, recognising that most people had limited knowledge or capacity to act
- Jewish resistance in its multiple forms, including armed uprisings, cultural resistance, and survival strategies

## Pedagogical Approaches: How to Teach the Holocaust

### The Problem of Simulations and Role Play

A fundamental principle of Holocaust pedagogy, endorsed by the USHMM, the IHRA, and the UCL Centre for Holocaust Education, is that **simulating experiences from the Holocaust remains pedagogically unsound**. This includes:
- Role-play activities where students take on the roles of perpetrators or victims
- Simulations of "decisions" that victims faced
- Activities that attempt to help students "feel what it was like"

Such approaches are problematic for several reasons. First, they create a false equivalence between the historical experience of victims and students' imagined responses. Second, they can be emotionally harmful to students, particularly those with personal or family connections to the Holocaust. Third, they often distort historical understanding by suggesting that victims had meaningful choices when, in fact, they were trapped within systems of overwhelming power.

As the IHRA Recommendations state: "In studying complex human behaviour... care is taken to prepare a class for such an activity, simulating experiences from the Holocaust remains pedagogically unsound."

### Starting with the Human Story

Effective Holocaust education typically begins with individual stories and personal testimony rather than abstract statistics. The UCL Centre's research-informed resources emphasise "using authentic personal stories to humanize experiences and challenge prejudice." This approach:
- Prevents the dehumanisation that can occur when six million becomes merely a number
- Enables students to engage emotionally as well as intellectually
- Provides a foundation for understanding broader historical processes

Teachers might begin with:
- Pre-war photographs and documents showing Jewish life and culture
- Personal testimonies from survivors (via the Holocaust Educational Trust's resources or the USC Shoah Foundation)
- Artefacts and letters that reveal individual experience

### Developing Historical Empathy Without Identification

Historical empathy—the capacity to understand how people in the past perceived their situations and made decisions—is distinct from identification or sympathy. Teaching should help students understand the perspectives of historical actors without asking them to imagine themselves in impossible situations.

The Facing History approach encourages students to examine "the human behaviour revealed in the choices of perpetrators, bystanders, resisters, and rescuers." This focuses attention on decision-making and agency within constraint, rather than on emotional identification.

### Using Primary Sources Critically

Holocaust education should develop students' critical source skills through engagement with authentic documents, photographs, and testimonies. However, teachers must be mindful that:
- Survivor testimony is a primary source requiring the same critical analysis as any other historical evidence
- Photographs were often taken by perpetrators and may reflect Nazi propaganda perspectives
- Documents need contextualisation to be properly understood

The UCL Centre's textbook and resources are designed to support this critical engagement, providing carefully selected sources with appropriate guidance.

### Addressing Difficult Questions

Teaching the Holocaust inevitably raises difficult questions that teachers should be prepared to address:

**Why didn't they leave?**

This common student question requires careful historical explanation. Most Jews could not simply "leave": emigration required visas, financial resources, and receiving countries willing to accept refugees. By the late 1930s, most nations had closed their borders to Jewish refugees. The 1938 Evian Conference demonstrated international unwillingness to accept Jewish refugees.

**Why didn't people resist?**

This question reflects a misconception about the nature of the Holocaust. Many Jews did resist in multiple forms. Moreover, the question often fails to recognise the overwhelming power imbalance between armed, organised perpetrators and largely unarmed, isolated, starving victims. As the UCL research notes, students benefit from learning about Jewish resistance, including armed uprisings such as the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.

**Would you have been a perpetrator?**

This question, sometimes posed in classrooms, is pedagogically problematic. It invites speculation about moral responses in situations that students cannot meaningfully imagine and risks normalising perpetrator behaviour through counterfactual reasoning.

## Student Misconceptions and Knowledge Gaps

### Findings from UCL Centre Research

The UCL Centre for Holocaust Education has conducted the world's largest research programme into students' knowledge and understanding of the Holocaust. Their findings reveal persistent misconceptions that teaching must address:

**Factual Inaccuracies**

The 2026 research report "Knowledge and Understandings of the Holocaust" found that while students' knowledge has improved since the 2016 study, "aspects of core knowledge and understanding of the Holocaust remain insecure." Specific findings include:
- Many students struggle to identify when the Holocaust occurred, with some placing it centuries earlier or confusing it with other events
- Limited understanding of the geographical scope, with students often unaware that the Holocaust occurred across multiple countries
- Confusion about who was responsible, with some students attributing the Holocaust solely to Hitler as an individual

**The "Kill or Be Killed" Myth**

The research found that 60% of students believed that a "kill or be killed" policy existed in relation to Third Reich troops who took part in the murders. This misconception—that perpetrators acted under duress—significantly distorts understanding of the Holocaust and requires explicit challenge.

**Social Media and Misinformation**

The Centre's 2025 research found that 59.4% of students had encountered Holocaust-related content on social media when they were not looking for it. This exposure to unverified content means that teaching must explicitly address misinformation and develop students' critical digital literacy alongside historical understanding.

### Conceptual Misunderstandings

Beyond factual errors, students often hold conceptual misunderstandings:

**The Progress Narrative**

Students sometimes assume that the Holocaust represented a primitive stage of human development that humanity has "moved beyond." Teaching should challenge this teleological view, emphasising that the Holocaust occurred in one of the most scientifically and culturally advanced societies of the twentieth century.

**The Foreignness of Perpetrators**

Students may conceptualise perpetrators as entirely "other"—monstrous, inhuman, fundamentally different from themselves. While psychologically protective, this understanding prevents recognition that genocide is committed by human beings operating within social systems.

**The Passivity of Victims**

Narratives that present victims as purely passive recipients of persecution miss the active strategies, cultural practices, and resistance that characterised Jewish responses. Teaching should include examples of Jewish agency within impossible constraints.

## Professional Development and Resources

### The UCL Centre for Holocaust Education

The UCL Centre for Holocaust Education is the UK's leading institution for Holocaust pedagogy. Their offerings include:

**Beacon Schools Programme**

A network of schools committed to excellence in Holocaust education, providing models of effective practice and supporting other schools in their regions.

**Teacher Development Programmes**

Free CPD courses for teachers, including "Understanding the Holocaust: How and Why Did It Happen?"—an online Masters-level module designed for teachers who aspire to lead the way in teaching this complex and disturbing history. As the DfE guidance states: "Trainee teachers or teachers in state-funded secondary schools in England can access Holocaust education CPD... Holocaust education CPD is free."

**The KS3 Textbook and Resources**

The Centre's textbook "Understanding the Holocaust" provides research-informed materials designed to address the specific misconceptions identified in their research. The textbook "encourages students to challenge common myths and misconceptions around the Holocaust."

### The Holocaust Educational Trust

The Holocaust Educational Trust (HET) provides:
- The Lessons from Auschwitz programme, enabling students to visit Auschwitz-Birkenau with preparatory and follow-up education
- Outreach programmes including survivor testimony
- Teaching resources and guidance

### IHRA Recommendations

The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's "Recommendations for Teaching and Learning about the Holocaust" (2019) provides an internationally-endorsed framework. The recommendations cover:
- Why teach about the Holocaust
- What to teach about the Holocaust
- How to teach about the Holocaust
- Key principles for policymakers and educators

The document notes that "nations have different histories and legitimate narratives about the Holocaust, different experiences of antisemitism, ethnic cleansing, racism, and genocide, and different educational settings, pedagogies, and traditions." However, it establishes shared principles that can guide practice across contexts.

## Assessment of Holocaust Knowledge

### Formative Assessment Strategies

Assessing students' understanding of the Holocaust requires careful design:

**Knowledge Checks**

Low-stakes quizzes can assess factual knowledge (dates, key terms, geographical locations) without dominating the curriculum. However, such assessments should be balanced with more complex tasks that assess understanding.

**Source Analysis Tasks**

Students might analyse photographs, survivor testimonies, or documents, demonstrating their ability to contextualise and interpret historical evidence.

**Extended Writing**

Essay questions should require students to demonstrate understanding of causation, change over time, or historical significance, rather than merely recounting events.

**Avoiding Inappropriate Assessment**

Assessment should never ask students to simulate perpetrator decisions or imagine themselves as victims. Such tasks are educationally unsound and potentially harmful.

## The Broader Educational Purpose

### Holocaust Education and Citizenship

While the Holocaust is taught within the history curriculum, its educational purposes extend beyond historical understanding. As UNESCO emphasises, teaching about the Holocaust can help students "take action to combat antisemitism in all its forms" and develop understanding of prejudice and discrimination more broadly.

The IHRA Recommendations note that "teaching and learning about the Holocaust can also help students to think critically about the world in which they live and to understand the dangers of uncritical acceptance of ideas, the risks of exclusionary practices, and the importance of civic engagement."

### Addressing Contemporary Antisemitism

Holocaust education is not merely about the past. The UCL Centre's research demonstrates that misconceptions about the Holocaust persist in wider society, and that these misconceptions are often linked to antisemitic attitudes. Effective Holocaust education contributes to challenging contemporary antisemitism by:
- Providing accurate historical knowledge that counteracts denial and distortion
- Developing understanding of how prejudice can escalate into discrimination and violence
- Building empathy and cross-cultural understanding

However, as the Centre warns, teaching about the Holocaust is not sufficient in itself to prevent antisemitism. It must be part of a broader curriculum that addresses prejudice, discrimination, and human rights.

## Conclusion

Teaching the Holocaust is a challenging responsibility that requires deep subject knowledge, sophisticated pedagogical understanding, and ongoing professional development. The mandatory status of Holocaust education in England reflects its importance, but the lack of detailed curriculum guidance means that teachers must take responsibility for ensuring their practice is research-informed and educationally sound.

The key principles emerging from research and professional guidance include:
- Teaching accurate, secure historical content within a clear chronological framework
- Avoiding simulations and role-play that distort historical understanding
- Beginning with human stories and individual testimony
- Addressing the specific misconceptions that students hold
- Using the Holocaust to develop historical thinking and critical analysis, not only moral lessons
- Recognising the complexity of human behaviour—perpetrator, victim, bystander, and rescuer—without oversimplification

The resources provided by the UCL Centre for Holocaust Education, the Holocaust Educational Trust, and the IHRA offer essential support for teachers in this work. Ultimately, effective Holocaust education enables students to engage with one of the most disturbing episodes in human history in ways that are historically accurate, emotionally appropriate, and educationally transformative.

## Key Debates in Holocaust Education

### The Uniqueness vs. Comparability Debate

A persistent debate in Holocaust education concerns whether the Holocaust should be taught as a unique event or whether it should be situated within broader frameworks of genocide, human rights, or racism. Both positions have educational implications.

**Arguments for Teaching the Holocaust as Unique**

Advocates of this position argue that the Holocaust's industrial scale, the ideology that drove it, and the systematic nature of the genocide distinguish it from other atrocities. Teaching the Holocaust as unique, they argue, honours the memory of victims and prevents the dilution of understanding that might occur through false equivalence. The IHRA working definition of Holocaust denial and distortion emphasises that minimising the Holocaust's scope or significance constitutes distortion.

**Arguments for Comparative and Relational Teaching**

Conversely, others argue that teaching the Holocaust only as unique prevents students from recognising patterns that might help prevent future genocides. From this perspective, understanding the Holocaust alongside other genocides (Armenian, Rwandan, Cambodian) or within broader histories of racism and persecution enables students to identify warning signs and structural factors.

**A Resolution**

The most defensible pedagogical position recognises that the Holocaust was historically distinctive in certain respects—particularly the systematic, state-sponsored, industrial nature of the genocide—while also acknowledging that understanding it within broader frameworks (antisemitism, totalitarianism, bystander behaviour) has educational value. The specific context and aims of teaching should guide the extent of comparison.

### The Question of Age-Appropriateness

While the National Curriculum mandates Holocaust education at Key Stage 3 (typically Year 9, age 13–14), questions arise about introducing the Holocaust earlier or later.

**Earlier Introduction**

Some educators argue for introducing Holocaust-related content in primary school or early secondary years, focusing on themes of prejudice, discrimination, and kindness. The Holocaust Educational Trust provides resources for primary and early Key Stage 3 that approach the subject through literature, testimony, and thematic study rather than graphic historical content.

However, critics caution that premature introduction—particularly of traumatic content—can be developmentally inappropriate. The USHMM guidelines suggest that "the Holocaust should be taught to students who are developmentally ready to study this history."

**Later Study**

Some schools delay Holocaust study until GCSE, arguing that older students have greater emotional maturity and cognitive capacity for the complex historical and ethical questions involved. However, this approach means that students who do not continue history beyond Key Stage 3 miss Holocaust education entirely—a problematic outcome given its mandatory status and educational importance.

**Balanced Approaches**

Many schools adopt a spiral approach: introducing themes of prejudice and discrimination in earlier years; providing foundational Holocaust education in Year 9; and offering deeper study through GCSE coursework, literature (such as *The Diary of Anne Frank* or *The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas* in English), or whole-school memorial activities.

### The Problem with Certain Texts

Teachers should exercise caution with certain widely-used texts. While *The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas* is commonly taught, the UCL Centre for Holocaust Education and other experts have raised concerns:

- It presents a historically inaccurate view of the Holocaust (the fence, the relationship between the boys, the ending)
- It centres the experience of a non-Jewish protagonist at Auschwitz
- It suggests equivalence between the experiences of victims and perpetrators' families

This is not to say such texts should never be used, but that teachers must be aware of their limitations and supplement them with historically accurate materials. The UCL Centre's research-informed textbook provides a more historically grounded alternative.

## Developing a School-Wide Approach

Holocaust education should not be confined to history lessons. A comprehensive approach includes:

**Cross-Curricular Links**

- **English**: Literature from or about the Holocaust; survivor memoirs; poetry
- **Religious Studies**: Jewish life and culture; ethical and theological questions
- **Citizenship/PSHE**: Prejudice, discrimination, human rights, democratic values
- **Art and Music**: Cultural responses to the Holocaust; art produced in ghettos and camps
- **Geography**: Mapping the Holocaust; understanding spatial dimensions of persecution

**Memorial and Commemoration**

Holocaust Memorial Day (27 January) provides an opportunity for whole-school reflection. However, commemoration should complement rather than replace historical education. Effective memorial activities:
- Are grounded in historical understanding
- Avoid sentimentality or simplification
- Connect the past to contemporary concerns
- Include student agency in planning and delivery

**Engaging with the Local and Familial**

Students benefit from understanding the Holocaust's connections to their own communities:
- Local history: Were there refugee communities in the area? What was the response to the Kindertransport?
- Family histories: Do any students have family connections to the Holocaust, either as survivors, refugees, or descendants of perpetrators/bystanders?
- National history: Britain's response to the Holocaust, including the Kindertransport, the Bermuda Conference, and knowledge of Auschwitz

## Practical Classroom Strategies

### Lesson Sequencing

A well-sequenced unit might follow this progression:

**Lesson 1–2: Context and Chronology**
- Establishing pre-war Jewish life in Europe
- Understanding the chronological framework
- Introducing key vocabulary

**Lesson 3–4: Escalation**
- From discrimination to persecution
- The Nuremberg Laws and Kristallnacht
- Emigration and the refugee crisis

**Lesson 5–6: The Holocaust**
- The invasion of Poland and the Soviet Union
- The Final Solution
- The camp system and killing centres

**Lesson 7–8: Responses**
- Jewish resistance and survival strategies
- Bystanders and collaborators
- Rescuers and rescue attempts

**Lesson 9–10: Aftermath and Legacy**
- Liberation and displaced persons
- The Nuremberg Trials
- Contemporary relevance and remembrance

### Using Testimony

Survivor testimony is a powerful pedagogical tool, but requires careful use:

- **Contextualise**: Ensure students understand that testimony is one form of evidence among many
- **Prepare**: Brief students on what they will hear and how to respond respectfully
- **Follow up**: Provide opportunity for reflection and discussion
- **Complement**: Use testimony alongside documentary sources, not as replacement

The Holocaust Educational Trust and USC Shoah Foundation provide extensive testimony archives suitable for classroom use.

### Handling Emotional Responses

Teaching the Holocaust will provoke emotional responses in students—and in teachers. Effective practice includes:
- Acknowledging emotional responses as legitimate
- Providing space for reflection
- Having support systems available for students who become distressed
- Taking care of your own wellbeing as a teacher engaging with traumatic content

## Conclusion: Towards Research-Informed Practice

Holocaust education in England has evolved significantly since its introduction as a mandatory topic in 1991. The research of the UCL Centre for Holocaust Education has transformed understanding of what students know and don't know, and of how teaching can be more effective.

Key priorities for research-informed practice include:

1. **Secure subject knowledge**: Teachers need deep understanding of the historical content, including chronology, geography, and the complexity of human behaviour.

2. **Pedagogical sophistication**: Teachers need to move beyond transmission approaches to engage students in historical thinking and critical analysis.

3. **Addressing misconceptions**: Teachers must actively identify and challenge the misconceptions that research has identified.

4. **Professional development**: Given the challenges involved, ongoing CPD through the UCL Centre, Holocaust Educational Trust, and other providers is essential.

5. **Ethical awareness**: Teachers must navigate the ethical dimensions of teaching traumatic content, respecting both historical truth and student wellbeing.

The Holocaust remains the only compulsory topic in the English history curriculum. This unique status reflects both its historical significance and its educational importance. Teaching it well is challenging but achievable—and essential for preparing young people to understand and engage with their world.
