# Assessment and Accountability in History Education

## Introduction

Assessment and accountability in history education have undergone significant transformation since the removal of National Curriculum levels in 2014. The current landscape presents both opportunities and challenges for history teachers, curriculum leaders, and senior leaders navigating the requirements of the Education Inspection Framework (EIF), statutory assessment arrangements, and the imperative to build meaningful progression models without prescribed level descriptors.

This knowledge file examines the statutory frameworks governing history assessment, the principles underpinning effective formative and summative assessment practices, the specific expectations during Ofsted inspections, and practical approaches to demonstrating accountability whilst maintaining pedagogical integrity in the history classroom.

## Statutory Assessment Frameworks

### The Post-Levels Landscape (2014–Present)

The 2014 National Curriculum marked a watershed moment for history assessment. For the first time since 1991, there were no level descriptions against which teachers could assess pupils' progress. The new attainment target states simply that: "By the end of each key stage, pupils are expected to know, apply and understand the matters, skills and processes specified in the relevant programme of study" (DfE, 2013).

This deliberate removal of levels was intended to give schools greater autonomy in developing assessment systems suited to their contexts. However, as the Historical Association has noted, the absence of statutory guidance has created significant variation in practice across schools, with some teachers feeling uncertain about how to demonstrate pupil progression effectively.

### Statutory Requirements by Key Stage

#### Key Stage 1

From the academic year 2023–2024, there is no statutory requirement for schools to carry out end of KS1 teacher assessment in history (STA, 2024). The removal of KS1 statutory assessment applies to all foundation subjects, including history. Schools retain discretion to conduct internal assessments, but no data submission to the Department for Education is required.

#### Key Stage 2

At Key Stage 2, the statutory position remains unchanged. Schools must report teacher assessment judgements in writing at the end of KS2, though history itself does not have statutory assessment frameworks comparable to English and mathematics. The Standards and Testing Agency (STA) provides guidance on rigorous and proportionate assessment processes, but schools determine their own criteria for reaching expected standards in history.

#### Key Stage 3

No statutory assessment requirements exist for history at KS3. Schools are free to develop their own assessment models, though many choose to align their criteria with GCSE assessment objectives to create coherent progression pathways.

#### Key Stage 4 (GCSE)

GCSE History assessment is governed by the specifications of individual awarding bodies (AQA, Edexcel, OCR, Eduqas). All specifications must meet the subject criteria established by Ofqual, ensuring comparability across boards. Assessment comprises:

- **Written examinations**: Typically 75–100% of the final grade, depending on specification
- **Non-examination assessment (NEA)**: Where included (maximum 20% weighting), this consists of historical investigation coursework

The four assessment objectives (AOs) are consistent across all specifications:
- AO1: Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the key features and characteristics of the periods studied
- AO2: Explain and analyse historical events and periods studied using second-order historical concepts
- AO3: Analyse, evaluate and use sources to make substantiated judgements
- AO4: Analyse, evaluate and make substantiated judgements about interpretations

## Principles of Effective Assessment in History

### Assessment for Learning (AfL)

The Assessment for Learning initiative, based on the extensive research of Paul Black and Dylan Wiliam at King's College London, remains foundational to effective history pedagogy. Their seminal work "Inside the Black Box" (1998) demonstrated that formative assessment, when embedded in everyday teaching, can raise standards significantly more than any other intervention.

In history, effective AfL practices include:

**Diagnostic questioning**: Using hinge questions to identify misconceptions about historical concepts before they become entrenched. For example, asking pupils to identify which of several statements best explains causation in a particular historical event reveals their understanding of the second-order concept.

**Wait time and think time**: Providing adequate thinking time before expecting responses, particularly when dealing with complex historical sources or interpretations.

**Peer and self-assessment**: Pupils evaluating their own and others' historical arguments against clear criteria, developing metacognitive awareness of what constitutes rigorous historical thinking.

**Feedback that moves learning forward**: Comments rather than grades; specific guidance on how to improve historical reasoning rather than generic praise or marks.

### Formative Assessment Strategies

#### Low-Stakes Retrieval Practice

Regular, low-stakes quizzing supports long-term retention of historical knowledge. This might include:
- Knowledge organisers with self-testing components
- Multiple-choice questions testing both substantive and disciplinary knowledge
- Chronological sequencing activities
- "Do now" starters that activate prior learning

#### Assessment of Historical Thinking

Effective formative assessment in history targets the disciplinary concepts (second-order concepts) that define the subject:

**Change and continuity**: Can pupils identify what changed and what remained the same across a period? Can they explain the pace and nature of change?

**Cause and consequence**: Can pupils distinguish between long-term and short-term causes? Do they understand the difference between necessary and sufficient conditions?

**Similarity and difference**: Can pupils avoid presentism when comparing past societies? Can they identify patterns whilst recognising diversity within groups?

**Significance**: Can pupils articulate criteria for historical significance? Can they explain why certain events or individuals have been accorded greater importance than others?

**Historical interpretations**: Can pupils recognise that interpretations differ and explain why historians reach different conclusions? Can they evaluate interpretations using criteria rather than simply expressing personal preference?

**Evidence and source work**: Can pupils evaluate the utility and reliability of sources? Do they understand the distinction between source comprehension and source evaluation?

### Summative Assessment Approaches

The Historical Association advises that "summative assessment in history should only be carried out at the end of a year or key stage" (HA, 2024). This reflects the time needed to develop secure historical understanding and the risk of premature summative judgement disrupting the learning process.

Effective summative assessment in history:
- Samples from across the domain (substantive knowledge, disciplinary concepts, different periods)
- Uses extended writing that allows pupils to demonstrate causal explanation, argumentation, and source analysis
- Provides opportunities for pupils to demonstrate understanding of historical interpretations
- Is marked against criteria derived from the curriculum intentions rather than generic rubrics

## Ofsted and the Education Inspection Framework

### The 2019 Education Inspection Framework

The Education Inspection Framework (EIF), introduced in September 2019, fundamentally changed how Ofsted evaluates history provision. The framework operates through four key judgements:

1. **Quality of education** (incorporating curriculum intent, implementation, and impact)
2. **Behaviour and attitudes**
3. **Personal development**
4. **Leadership and management**

For history specifically, the "quality of education" judgement is paramount. Ofsted inspectors evaluate:

**Curriculum intent**: Whether the history curriculum is ambitious, coherent, and sequenced to build knowledge and skills progressively.

**Curriculum implementation**: How well the curriculum is taught, including the development of both substantive and disciplinary knowledge.

**Curriculum impact**: Whether pupils know more, remember more, and can do more as a result of the curriculum—demonstrated through attainment and progress.

### Subject Deep Dives

Ofsted inspectors conduct subject deep dives to evaluate the quality of education. As of September 2024, ungraded inspections no longer include subject deep dives, though graded inspections continue this practice (Ofsted, 2024).

A history deep dive typically comprises:

**Evaluation of curriculum documentation**: Inspectors scrutinise curriculum intent documents, schemes of work, and assessment policies. They look for evidence that the curriculum is planned and sequenced to build knowledge progressively.

**Lesson visits**: Inspectors visit a deliberately connected sample of lessons to observe how the curriculum is implemented. They do not grade individual lessons but look for patterns across the sample.

**Work scrutiny**: Examination of pupils' books to evaluate whether the curriculum is being implemented as intended and whether pupils are making progress.

**Discussions with pupils**: Conversations with pupils from observed lessons to ascertain what they have learned and whether they can make connections across the curriculum.

**Discussions with staff**: Interviews with curriculum leaders, teachers, and senior leaders to evaluate their understanding of curriculum intent, implementation, and impact.

### Assessment in Deep Dives: Key Questions

Inspectors frequently ask assessment-related questions during deep dives, including:

- How do you assess pupil progress in history without levels?
- What does "expected" look like in history at different stages?
- How do you know pupils are making progress?
- How does assessment inform curriculum planning?
- What do you do when pupils fall behind in history?
- How does your assessment system support pupils with SEND?

### Ofsted Research Reviews

Ofsted's research review series provides insight into what inspectors consider high-quality history provision. The review identifies common weaknesses, including:

> "We also saw generally weaker practice in the teaching of disciplinary knowledge. This is knowledge of how historians study the past and construct accounts. In most schools, pupils' knowledge in this area was not secure. We saw a lot of teaching that encouraged misconceptions about the discipline of history." (Ofsted, 2021)

This finding has significant implications for assessment. Schools must ensure their assessment systems evaluate disciplinary knowledge—not merely whether pupils can recall substantive facts, but whether they understand how historical knowledge is constructed, contested, and revised.

## Accountability Measures

### Data and Performance Tables

History features in accountability measures in the following ways:

**EBacc measure**: History is one of the qualifying humanities subjects for the English Baccalaureate (EBacc). School performance tables report the proportion of pupils entering the EBacc and the proportion achieving it (grades 9–5 in English, mathematics, two sciences, a humanities subject, and a language).

**Attainment 8 and Progress 8**: For schools entering pupils for GCSE History, results contribute to Attainment 8 and Progress 8 scores. History counts in the "EBacc bucket" (slots 3–5 of Attainment 8).

**KS2 destinations**: Whilst no statutory assessment exists at KS2, Ofsted may consider transition data and the proportion of pupils opting for history at KS3/KS4 as indicators of curriculum impact.

### Internal Accountability Systems

Schools employ various mechanisms to monitor and assure the quality of history provision:

**Assessment data tracking**: Regular collection and analysis of assessment data to identify pupils making insufficient progress.

**Book scrutiny**: Systematic examination of pupils' work to evaluate curriculum implementation and consistency.

**Learning walks and observations**: Brief visits to history lessons to monitor teaching quality and curriculum implementation.

**Pupil progress meetings**: Conversations between senior leaders, middle leaders, and teachers about the progress of specific pupils or groups.

**External review**: Some schools engage external providers or academy trust subject specialists to conduct curriculum reviews.

### Managing Accountability Pressures

The tension between accountability requirements and principled assessment practice is a recurring challenge. History curriculum leaders must navigate:

**The data demand**: Senior leaders and governors often want numerical data demonstrating progress. History teachers may feel pressure to create spuriously precise tracking systems to satisfy this demand.

**The workload burden**: Excessive assessment and data collection can undermine teacher wellbeing and detract from planning high-quality lessons.

**The comparability problem**: Without standardised criteria, comparing history attainment across classes or schools is problematic. Attempts to create pseudo-levels or flight paths can reintroduce the flaws of the old system.

Effective history leaders resist these pressures by:
- Focusing on the quality of assessment rather than the quantity of data
- Educating senior leaders about the nature of historical learning and the limitations of numerical tracking in humanities subjects
- Developing assessment systems that genuinely support teaching and learning rather than merely satisfying external accountability demands
- Using sampling and moderation rather than collecting excessive data

## Practical Approaches to Assessment Without Levels

### Developing Assessment Criteria

Schools have developed various approaches to assessing history without National Curriculum levels:

**Threshold concepts**: Identifying the crucial concepts pupils must grasp to make progress (e.g., understanding that causation involves multiple interacting factors rather than simple chains of events).

**Progression models**: Describing increasingly sophisticated thinking within each second-order concept. For example, progression in causation might move from identifying causes → categorising causes → explaining relationships between causes → evaluating relative significance.

**Milestone assessments**: Defining what pupils should know and be able to do at key points (end of Year 2, Year 4, Year 6, Year 9).

**Competency frameworks**: Describing levels of proficiency in historical skills (e.g., emerging, developing, secure, advanced) without implying a linear progression through numbered levels.

### The Role of Comparative Judgement

Comparative judgement is an assessment approach gaining traction in history education. Rather than assessing individual pieces of work against criteria, teachers compare pairs of work and decide which is better. Over multiple comparisons, a rank order emerges that is typically more reliable than traditional marking.

The approach has several advantages:
- It acknowledges the holistic nature of quality historical writing
- It reduces the burden of detailed rubrics and criteria
- It generates high levels of reliability between judges
- It can be conducted via online platforms that streamline the process

However, comparative judgement provides rank order rather than absolute standards, so it is typically used alongside other assessment approaches.

### Moderation and Standardisation

Effective assessment in history relies on robust moderation processes:

**Internal moderation**: Teachers within a department review samples of work together, discussing standards and ensuring consistency.

**Cross-school moderation**: Collaboration with other schools to validate standards and share practice.

**External support**: Engagement with Historical Association networks, local authority advisory services (where available), or academy trust subject networks.

Moderation is particularly important given the absence of statutory standards. It provides the only mechanism for assuring that "expected" in one school bears some relationship to "expected" in another.

## Assessment at Transition Points

### KS2–KS3 Transition

The transition from primary to secondary history presents particular assessment challenges. The Historical Association's KS2–KS3 Transition Project found significant variation in the quantity and quality of history teaching at KS2, with some pupils arriving in Year 7 having had limited history provision.

Effective transition assessment involves:

**Information transfer**: Secondary teachers receiving meaningful assessment information from primary colleagues—not just generic levels, but specific information about what pupils have studied and what they can do.

**Baseline assessment**: Early assessment in Year 7 to identify what pupils know and can do, informing curriculum planning.

**Curriculum continuity**: Ensuring that assessment criteria at KS3 build appropriately from KS2 foundations without unnecessary repetition.

### KS3–KS4 Transition

As pupils approach GCSE, assessment increasingly aligns with the demands of the specifications:

**GCSE readiness**: Assessing whether pupils have developed the necessary disciplinary knowledge and written communication skills for GCSE success.

**Assessment objective alignment**: Using GCSE assessment objectives (AO1–AO4) as the basis for KS3 assessment in Years 8–9 to create coherent progression.

**Attainment tracking**: Monitoring whether pupils are on track for target grades, particularly for EBacc accountability measures.

## Special Educational Needs and Assessment

### The Engagement Model

For pupils working below the standard of the National Curriculum and not engaged in subject-specific study, the Engagement Model remains statutory (STA, 2024). This applies to a small number of pupils in each cohort who are not accessing the standard history curriculum.

### SEND and Inclusive Assessment

For pupils with SEND accessing the history curriculum, assessment should:

- Focus on progress from individual starting points rather than comparison with age-related expectations
- Recognise that historical thinking, not just recall of facts, is achievable for most pupils with appropriate support
- Use adapted assessment methods where necessary (e.g., oral assessment, scaffolds, additional time)
- Be informed by detailed knowledge of individual pupils' barriers to learning

## Conclusion

Assessment and accountability in history education requires careful navigation of competing pressures. The removal of National Curriculum levels created space for schools to develop more nuanced assessment approaches, but this autonomy brings responsibility. History curriculum leaders must develop systems that:

- Maintain the integrity of the discipline, assessing both substantive and disciplinary knowledge
- Support teaching and learning through effective formative assessment practices
- Satisfy accountability demands without excessive workload or spurious precision
- Withstand scrutiny during Ofsted deep dives by demonstrating clear curriculum intent, thoughtful implementation, and evidence of impact
- Are moderated and validated to ensure standards are meaningful

The Historical Association, Ofsted research reviews, and the broader history education community provide resources and guidance to support this work. Ultimately, effective assessment in history serves one primary purpose: ensuring that pupils develop deeper, more secure, and more sophisticated historical knowledge and understanding over time.

## Appendix: Sample Assessment Activities by Key Stage

### Key Stage 1 Examples

**Chronological Understanding Assessment**
Pupils arrange a series of picture cards showing events from their own lives (baby, toddler, starting school) in the correct order. Teacher observes whether pupils can use terms such as "before," "after," "older," and "younger" accurately.

**Source Evaluation Introduction**
Pupils are shown a photograph of their classroom taken ten years ago. They identify what is the same and what has changed. Teacher assesses whether pupils understand that the photograph provides evidence about the past.

### Key Stage 2 Examples

**Causal Explanation Task**
After studying the Roman withdrawal from Britain, pupils complete a diamond nine activity ranking causes by importance. They write a paragraph explaining which cause they consider most significant and why.

**Historical Interpretation Assessment**
Pupils examine two contrasting depictions of King John (as tyrant vs. misunderstood monarch). They identify differences and suggest reasons why historians might disagree.

### Key Stage 3 Examples

**Source Analysis Assessment**
Pupils are given three sources about the Industrial Revolution and asked: "How far do these sources support the view that industrialisation improved living standards?" Assessment focuses on evaluation of utility and reliability, not merely comprehension.

**Interpretations Evaluation**
Pupils read two extracts from historians with different views on the causes of the First World War. They identify the differences and evaluate which interpretation they find more convincing, using their own knowledge to support their judgement.

## Case Study: Implementing Assessment Without Levels

### Context

A large multi-academy trust with eight primary schools sought to develop a coherent assessment approach for history following the removal of National Curriculum levels. Previous practice had relied heavily on APP (Assessing Pupils' Progress) grids, and teachers felt uncertain about how to demonstrate progress without these structures.

### Approach

The trust adopted a progression model based on second-order concepts, developed in collaboration with the Historical Association. For each concept (cause, change, significance, etc.), they identified four stages of development: beginning, developing, secure, and advanced. These were not applied as blanket judgements but used to assess specific pieces of work.

### Implementation

- Year-long professional development programme for all history subject leaders
- Termly moderation meetings across schools using shared assessment tasks
- Development of annotated work samples exemplifying each stage
- Regular review and refinement based on teacher feedback

### Outcomes

After two years, teachers reported increased confidence in assessing history without levels. Ofsted deep dives in three schools found that assessment systems were well understood and provided useful information about pupil progress. Pupil attainment at KS2 showed improvement, with more pupils achieving secure understanding of disciplinary concepts.

### Lessons Learned

- Moderation is essential—shared understanding of standards cannot be assumed
- Focus on specific concepts rather than generic "historical thinking"
- Allow time for professional learning—teachers need to understand what progression looks like
- Resist pressure to create pseudo-levels or numerical tracking systems
