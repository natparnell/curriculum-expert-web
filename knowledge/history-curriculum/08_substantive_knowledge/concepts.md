# Concepts in History: Abstract Ideas Across Contexts

## Introduction

Historical concepts are abstract ideas that transcend individual events, periods, or societies. Unlike factual knowledge about what happened in the past, concepts in history enable pupils to recognise patterns, draw comparisons, and develop sophisticated understandings of human experience across time and space. This knowledge file explores the nature of historical concepts, their role in the curriculum, progression in conceptual understanding across key stages, and practical strategies for teaching abstract ideas such as nationalism, power, and living standards.

The distinction between substantive concepts (ideas about the content of the past) and disciplinary concepts (ideas about how history works as a form of knowledge) is fundamental to curriculum design. However, these categories are not rigidly separate—concepts often operate across both domains, and their development requires careful sequencing to ensure pupils build increasingly sophisticated mental models.

## Understanding Historical Concepts

### The Nature of Abstract Historical Ideas

Historical concepts differ from concrete factual knowledge in that they require pupils to generalise across multiple instances. When a pupil learns that the Battle of Hastings occurred in 1066, they acquire a specific fact. When they develop an understanding of 'conquest' as a concept, they must draw upon knowledge of multiple conquests—Norman, Mongol, Spanish, British—and identify what these events share at an abstract level while recognising their particularities.

Lee and Shemilt (2003) argue that historical concepts are essential for pupils to move beyond the 'parachute' approach to history, where topics are studied in isolation without connection to broader patterns of human experience. Concepts provide the intellectual architecture that allows pupils to make meaningful comparisons, understand causation at deeper levels, and engage with the second-order concepts that characterise historical thinking.

The challenge for curriculum designers and teachers lies in recognising that concepts in history are not merely labels to be defined but tools for thinking that develop gradually through sustained engagement with multiple historical contexts. A pupil's understanding of 'revolution', for instance, will differ significantly at Key Stage 3 compared to Key Stage 5—not simply because they know more examples, but because their conceptual framework has become more nuanced and capable of accommodating complexity.

### Substantive vs. Disciplinary Concepts

Christine Counsell's influential distinction between substantive knowledge (knowledge of the past) and disciplinary knowledge (knowledge of how history works) provides a useful framework, though the boundary between these categories is porous when considering concepts.

**Substantive concepts** include ideas such as empire, democracy, nationalism, feudalism, and industrialisation—concepts that describe features of past societies. These concepts form part of the content that historians study and pupils learn about. They are 'residue' concepts in Counsell's terms: the accumulated conceptual understanding that remains when specific details fade.

**Disciplinary concepts** include causation, change and continuity, similarity and difference, significance, and interpretation—concepts that describe how historians construct knowledge about the past. These are often called second-order concepts because they concern the procedures and categories historians use to organise and make sense of substantive content.

However, many concepts operate across this boundary. 'Power', for instance, is both a substantive concept (describing relationships of authority and control in past societies) and a disciplinary tool (helping historians analyse causes of events or explain why certain groups could impose their will on others). Similarly, 'evidence' functions substantively as the traces left by the past and disciplinarily as the basis for historical claims.

Understanding this interplay is crucial for curriculum design. Effective history teaching does not treat substantive and disciplinary concepts as separate tracks but weaves them together so that pupils develop richer conceptual understanding through engagement with historical inquiry.

## Key Historical Concepts: Progression and Pedagogy

### Nationalism

#### Conceptual Overview

Nationalism—the ideology that holds that the nation should be the central principle of political organisation—represents one of the most powerful and consequential concepts in modern history. For pupils, developing an understanding of nationalism requires grappling with multiple dimensions: the emotional and cultural attachment to national identity; the political claim that nations should have sovereign states; the historical emergence of nations as 'imagined communities' (Anderson, 1983); and the variable, contested nature of national identity across time and space.

#### Progression Across Key Stages

**Key Stage 2:** At this stage, pupils encounter nationalism in its most accessible form through stories of national identity and belonging. The concept may emerge through topics such as the Victorians (identifying symbols of British identity), ancient civilisations (what made someone 'Roman' or 'Greek'), or local history (how their area became part of England). The focus should be on recognition that people in the past identified with groups larger than their immediate community and that these identities involved shared symbols, stories, and loyalties.

**Key Stage 3:** Pupils can begin to distinguish between cultural nationality (feeling part of a nation) and political nationalism (demanding national self-determination). The concept can be developed through case studies such as the unification of Italy and Germany, the growth of Indian nationalism under the Raj, or the breakup of Yugoslavia. Pupils should understand that nations are not natural or eternal but constructed through historical processes, and that nationalism could be both a force for liberation and for oppression depending on context.

**Key Stage 4 (GCSE):** At this level, pupils engage with nationalism as a causal factor and object of historical debate. Questions might include: How significant was nationalism in causing the First World War? How did Nazi racial ideology represent a perversion or extension of German nationalism? Pupils should recognise that historians disagree about the nature and power of nationalism in different periods and that the concept itself has been understood differently by historians from various national traditions.

**Key Stage 5 (A-Level):** Advanced study involves theoretical engagement with nationalism as an analytical category. Pupils encounter Anderson's 'imagined communities', Gellner's functionalist account, and Smith's ethnosymbolic approach. They analyse how nationalism operated differently in civic versus ethnic forms, how it intersected with imperialism and decolonisation, and how historians have debated whether nationalism is a distinctly modern phenomenon or has deeper roots.

#### Common Misconceptions

Pupils frequently approach nationalism with assumptions derived from contemporary experience of relatively stable nation-states. Common misconceptions include:

- **Eternal nations:** Believing that modern nations (France, Germany, Britain) have existed since time immemorial rather than being constructed through historical processes.
- **Natural nationalism:** Assuming that national identity is a natural human characteristic rather than a historically specific form of group identity.
- **Uniform nationalism:** Treating nationalism as a single phenomenon rather than recognising its varieties (civic, ethnic, cultural, diasporic).
- **Positive/negative binary:** Viewing nationalism simplistically as either good (liberation movements) or bad (aggressive expansion) rather than recognising its ambivalent potential.

#### Teaching Strategies

Effective teaching of nationalism requires multiple contexts to prevent the concept becoming tethered to a single example. The 'same concept, different contexts' approach recommended by the Historical Association helps pupils recognise both what unites different manifestations of nationalism and what is specific to each case.

Using primary sources that reveal the emotional power of nationalism—national anthems, patriotic poetry, propaganda posters—helps pupils understand why this concept motivated historical actors so powerfully. Simultaneously, sources that problematise national identity—accounts of minority experiences, documents revealing the constructed nature of national traditions—prevent uncritical acceptance of nationalist narratives.

Comparison activities work particularly well for nationalism. Comparing German and Italian unification reveals different routes to nation-state formation. Comparing Indian and Irish nationalism illuminates how anti-colonial movements adapted and challenged European nationalist models. Comparing nineteenth-century and post-1945 nationalism highlights how the concept's meanings and manifestations changed.

### Power

#### Conceptual Overview

Power in history refers to the capacity of individuals, groups, or institutions to influence or control the behaviour of others, allocate resources, and shape social, political, and economic outcomes. It is perhaps the most ubiquitous concept in historical study, relevant from ancient empires to contemporary global relations. Understanding power requires recognising its multiple forms—political, economic, military, cultural, ideological—and its operation through both coercion and consent.

The concept connects closely to other abstract ideas: authority (legitimate power), hierarchy (structured power relations), resistance (challenges to power), and revolution (fundamental power shifts). For pupils, developing a sophisticated understanding of power means moving from seeing it as something possessed by individuals (kings, dictators) to understanding it as relational, distributed, and contested.

#### Progression Across Key Stages

**Key Stage 2:** Initial encounters with power focus on recognising who had authority in past societies and how they exercised it. Pupils learn about pharaohs, emperors, monarchs, and chiefs—figures who held obvious positions of authority. The concept is developed through stories of decision-making: how Henry VIII changed England's religion, how Egyptian pharaohs organised the building of pyramids. The emphasis should be on recognition that societies have structures of authority and that these differ across time and place.

**Key Stage 3:** Pupils develop more nuanced understanding of how power worked beyond the throne. They encounter economic power (the role of merchants, industrialists), religious power (the authority of the Church, religious leaders), and social power (how class, gender, and race structured opportunity and constraint). The concept of power as contested becomes central—pupils study rebellions, reform movements, and revolutions not as isolated events but as instances of power being challenged and sometimes redistributed.

Key Stage 3 also introduces the distinction between formal power (official positions and legal authority) and informal power (influence through wealth, reputation, networks). Case studies such as the power of medieval barons versus monarchs, or industrialists versus parliament in the nineteenth century, develop this understanding.

**Key Stage 4 (GCSE):** At GCSE, pupils engage with power as an analytical tool for explaining historical change. Rather than simply identifying who held power, they analyse how power relations shaped outcomes: How did the balance of power between crown and Parliament change 1625-1701? How did the Nazi regime consolidate and maintain power? 

The concept also becomes important for understanding historical interpretations. Different historians attribute change to different power dynamics—materialist historians emphasising economic power, political historians focusing on institutional power, cultural historians highlighting ideological power. Pupils learn to evaluate these competing emphases.

**Key Stage 5 (A-Level):** Advanced study involves theoretical engagement with power as an analytical category drawn from political theory and sociology. Pupils encounter Weber's typology of authority (traditional, charismatic, legal-rational), Foucault's analysis of power/knowledge, and Gramsci's concept of hegemony. They apply these frameworks to historical cases and evaluate their explanatory utility.

A-Level study also emphasises the intersectionality of power—how gender, class, race, and other factors create overlapping and sometimes contradictory power relations. The concept of 'soft power' (cultural and ideological influence) versus 'hard power' (military and economic coercion) provides a framework for analysing international relations across periods.

#### Common Misconceptions

- **Power as possession:** Understanding power as something individuals or groups simply 'have' rather than as a relational dynamic.
- **Power as monolithic:** Failing to recognise that power is distributed across multiple institutions and relationships, not concentrated in a single source.
- **Power as static:** Assuming that power structures remain stable rather than constantly being reproduced, contested, and transformed.
- **Top-down only:** Focusing exclusively on those in formal authority positions and neglecting how power operates from below through resistance, accommodation, and everyday practice.

#### Teaching Strategies

Visual representations help pupils grasp the distribution of power. Hierarchy pyramids, spider diagrams showing power networks, and flowcharts tracing decision-making processes make abstract relationships concrete.

Role-play and simulation activities allow pupils to experience power dynamics. Simulating the medieval feudal system, the operation of a slave plantation, or decision-making in a dictatorship helps pupils understand how power structured lived experience, not just abstract relationships.

Source work should include 'voices from below'—accounts by those subject to power as well as those wielding it. This prevents history becoming a story of great men and helps pupils recognise that power is always contested and experienced differently depending on social position.

### Living Standards

#### Conceptual Overview

Living standards refer to the level of wealth, comfort, material goods, and necessities available to individuals or groups in a given society. The concept encompasses multiple dimensions: economic (income, wealth, employment security), material (housing, diet, clothing, sanitation), social (access to education, healthcare, leisure), and subjective (quality of life, happiness, security). For historians, living standards present particular challenges of measurement and comparison across time and space.

The concept connects to broader historical narratives of progress and decline, industrialisation and deindustrialisation, welfare state development, and inequality. Understanding living standards requires pupils to move beyond simplistic narratives of 'getting better' to recognise the uneven distribution of material improvement and the varied experiences of different social groups.

#### Progression Across Key Stages

**Key Stage 2:** At this stage, pupils encounter living standards through comparison of daily life across periods. Topics such as 'how homes have changed', 'what people ate in the past', or 'Victorian childhood' develop awareness that material conditions varied across time. The concept is primarily experiential—pupils imagine what daily life felt like for children in different periods—rather than analytical.

Simple comparison frameworks help: did people have enough to eat? Did they have safe homes? Did children go to school? These concrete questions build foundational understanding that material conditions vary and can be compared.

**Key Stage 3:** Pupils develop more systematic understanding of how living standards are measured and how they changed. The Industrial Revolution provides a crucial case study, with pupils analysing contrasting historical interpretations about whether industrialisation improved or worsened living standards for the working class. This introduces the idea that historians disagree about such assessments and that evidence can support different conclusions.

Key Stage 3 also develops understanding of the unequal distribution of living standards within societies. Studying Victorian Britain, pupils compare the lives of factory workers, middle-class professionals, and the wealthy. Studying the British Empire, they examine how colonialism extracted wealth from colonised populations while improving living standards for some in Britain.

**Key Stage 4 (GCSE):** GCSE study involves more sophisticated engagement with historical debate about living standards. The 'standard of living debate' regarding the Industrial Revolution—did real wages rise? Did mortality improve? How did quality of life change?—exemplifies how historians use quantitative and qualitative evidence to assess material conditions. Pupils learn to evaluate different types of evidence (wage data, household budgets, literary accounts, public health records) and recognise their limitations.

The concept also appears in twentieth-century topics: the impact of the World Wars on living standards, the establishment of the welfare state, the 1950s 'age of austerity' versus the 'never had it so good' era, Thatcherism and deindustrialisation. Pupils analyse how governments attempted to influence living standards and with what effects.

**Key Stage 5 (A-Level):** Advanced study involves theoretical engagement with how living standards have been conceptualised and measured. Pupils encounter debates about whether GDP per capita adequately captures living standards, the development of alternative measures such as the Human Development Index, and the challenges of assessing subjective well-being historically.

A-Level study also emphasises the global dimension: comparing living standards across societies at the same moment, analysing the 'great divergence' between Western Europe and other world regions, examining development and underdevelopment as historical processes. The concept of 'precarity'—economic insecurity and vulnerability—provides a framework for understanding how living standards depend not just on current conditions but on security and predictability.

#### Common Misconceptions

- **Universal progress:** Assuming that living standards improved steadily and uniformly for everyone over time.
- **Present-day superiority:** Assuming that all aspects of contemporary life represent improvement on the past (neglecting, for instance, working hours, community cohesion, environmental quality).
- **Economic reductionism:** Treating living standards as purely about money and possessions rather than encompassing health, education, leisure, and security.
- **Homogeneous experience:** Failing to recognise the enormous variation in living standards within any given period based on class, gender, race, region, and occupation.

#### Teaching Strategies

Quantitative work with historical evidence develops pupils' capacity to assess living standards systematically. Using real wage data, household budgets, or mortality statistics helps pupils move beyond impressionistic assessment to evidence-based argument.

However, qualitative sources remain essential for capturing dimensions of living standards that elude measurement. Diaries, letters, oral history testimonies, and literature reveal how people experienced and understood their material conditions—what mattered to them, what they worried about, what gave them satisfaction.

Comparison across time and space prevents parochialism. Comparing British industrial workers with Indian textile artisans, or comparing urban and rural living standards, helps pupils recognise that 'improvement' and 'decline' are relative and contested.

## Additional Key Concepts

### Empire and Imperialism

Empire represents one of the most significant organising concepts for understanding world history from antiquity to the present. Pupils' understanding should progress from recognising empires as large territorial states to analysing the systems of extraction, cultural exchange, and power relations that characterised imperial formations.

The distinction between empire (the political entity) and imperialism (the processes and ideologies that sustain and justify it) becomes important at Key Stage 3 and beyond. Pupils should understand that empires were not simply 'big countries' but heterogeneous formations that ruled different populations through different mechanisms, and that imperialism involved both domination and the production of knowledge, categories, and identities that shaped coloniser and colonised alike.
