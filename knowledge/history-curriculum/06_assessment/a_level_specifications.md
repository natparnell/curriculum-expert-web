# A Level History Specifications

## Overview

A Level History represents a significant step-up from GCSE, requiring students to engage with history at a more sophisticated level, demonstrating deeper conceptual understanding, enhanced analytical skills, and greater intellectual independence. The qualification is designed to foster students' interest in and enthusiasm for history whilst developing their ability to think critically about the past.

The current A Level History specifications were introduced for first teaching in September 2015 as part of the wider government reforms to A Levels initiated by then-Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove. These reforms sought to make A Levels more academically rigorous, with a greater emphasis on terminal examinations and a move away from modular assessment structures.

## Exam Board Landscape

### AQA (7042)

AQA is the largest provider of A Level History in England, offering the most extensive range of topic options. Their specification is structured around three components: a breadth study with interpretations (Component 1), a depth study with primary sources (Component 2), and a Historical Investigation coursework component (Component 3).

The AQA specification requires students to study topics covering at least 200 years of history across the three components, with British history forming at least 20% of the assessed content as required by the Department for Education (DfE).

### Pearson Edexcel (9HI0)

Edexcel's specification follows a similar three-component structure but with distinctive features. Component 1 is a breadth study with interpretations, Component 2 is a depth study, and Component 3 is the coursework (Historical Investigation). Edexcel offers a particularly strong range of thematic breadth studies that trace developments across extended time periods.

Edexcel's approach to interpretations (AO3) differs slightly from AQA, with their assessment structure placing different weightings on the various assessment objectives within the coursework component.

### OCR (H505)

OCR offers a specification with British period study and enquiry (Component 1), non-British period study (Component 2), and a thematic study with a source-based enquiry (Component 3). Their structure allows for some flexibility in how the thematic study is approached.

### WJEC Eduqas

Eduqas provides specifications for centres in Wales and England, with distinct approaches to assessment that maintain the core requirements established by Ofqual whilst offering different thematic and chronological options.

## Assessment Objectives

The assessment objectives for A Level History are prescribed by Ofqual and are consistent across all awarding bodies. Understanding these objectives is fundamental to effective teaching and student success.

### AO1: Knowledge and Understanding (60% weighting)

Students must demonstrate, organise and communicate knowledge and understanding to analyse and evaluate the key features related to the periods studied, making substantiated judgements and exploring concepts of cause, consequence, change, continuity, similarity, difference and significance.

This objective demands that students move beyond mere description or narration of events. They must construct arguments that are analytically driven, supported by precise factual evidence, and evaluated against clear criteria for judgement. The disciplinary concepts embedded within AO1—cause, consequence, change, continuity, similarity, difference and significance—form the conceptual framework through which historical understanding is developed.

Teaching AO1 effectively requires explicit attention to how these concepts operate within specific historical contexts. Students must understand, for example, that causation at A Level is not simply about identifying factors but about weighing their relative importance, understanding their interaction, and recognising how different historians have conceptualised causal relationships differently.

### AO2: Analysis and Evaluation of Sources (20% weighting)

Students must analyse and evaluate appropriate source material, primary and/or contemporary to the period, within its historical context.

This objective requires students to engage with primary sources in a sophisticated manner. They must consider provenance, context, tone, emphasis and potential bias. Crucially, evaluation at A Level moves beyond generic comments about reliability to consider the value of sources for particular historical enquiries. A source may be highly biased yet extraordinarily valuable for understanding contemporary attitudes or propaganda techniques.

Effective teaching of AO2 involves developing students' understanding of the historian's craft. They must learn to interrogate sources systematically: Who produced this? When? For what purpose? In what circumstances? What can it tell us that other sources cannot? What are its limitations for the specific enquiry at hand?

### AO3: Analysis and Evaluation of Interpretations (20% weighting)

Students must analyse and evaluate, in relation to the historical context, different ways in which aspects of the past have been interpreted.

This is often the most challenging objective for students. It requires them to engage with historical debate, understanding that history is not a fixed body of knowledge but an ongoing conversation among historians. Students must identify arguments within historical interpretations, evaluate the evidence and methodology underpinning those arguments, and form reasoned judgements about the relative validity of different perspectives.

Teaching AO3 requires exposing students to genuine historical scholarship. They must encounter historians arguing with one another, understand the intellectual and political contexts in which interpretations emerge, and recognise how historical debates evolve over time in response to new evidence, methodological innovations, and changing intellectual currents.

## Component Structures

### Component 1: Breadth Study with Interpretations

This component typically carries 40% of the overall A Level and assesses AO1 (knowledge and understanding) and AO3 (interpretations). It requires students to study a broad historical period—usually covering a minimum of 20 years, and often significantly more.

The examination paper has two sections:

**Section A: Interpretations Question (30 marks)**

Students are presented with three extracts from historical interpretations addressing a broad issue or development within the period studied. They must identify the arguments presented in each extract, evaluate these arguments using their contextual knowledge, and reach a substantiated judgement about the validity of the interpretations.

Common student errors include summarising the extracts without genuine evaluation, failing to engage with the arguments themselves (focusing instead on surface-level comparison), and neglecting to use contextual knowledge to test the interpretations against the historical record.

**Section B: Essay Questions (25 marks each, answer two)**

Students answer two essays from a choice of three, with each essay testing understanding of developments and issues across the breadth study period. Questions focus on causation, change, continuity, similarity, difference and significance over time.

Effective responses demonstrate strong chronological coverage, analytical depth, and the ability to construct and sustain an argument across an extended response. Weak responses tend to be narrative-driven, lacking clear analytical structure, or display poor time management resulting in incomplete answers.

### Component 2: Depth Study

This component also carries 40% of the A Level and assesses AO1 and AO2 (sources). It focuses on a shorter, more concentrated period of history studied in depth.

**Section A: Sources Question (30 marks)**

Students evaluate the value of three primary sources for a particular historical enquiry. They must assess provenance, context, and content, demonstrating understanding of how historians use evidence and why sources may present different perspectives on the same events.

The skill here is contextual analysis—understanding each source within its specific circumstances of production whilst evaluating its utility for the particular question at hand. Students often struggle to move beyond generic comments about bias to sophisticated evaluation of how a source's specific characteristics affect its value.

**Section B: Essay Questions (25 marks each, answer two)**

These essays test AO1 in depth, requiring detailed knowledge of the period and the ability to construct analytically driven arguments about causation, consequence, change, and other second-order concepts within a focused timeframe.

### Component 3: Historical Investigation (Non-Examined Assessment)

The Historical Investigation, or coursework component, carries 20% of the A Level and uniquely assesses all three assessment objectives. Students complete an independent enquiry of approximately 3,000-3,500 words (depending on the awarding body), investigating a specific historical question of their choosing within parameters set by the specification.

The NEA requires students to:

- Formulate a valid historical question that permits substantive analysis
- Research independently using both primary sources and secondary interpretations
- Analyse and evaluate primary source evidence (AO2)
- Engage with historical interpretations and debates (AO3)
- Construct and sustain a substantiated analytical argument (AO1)

This component offers significant opportunities for developing independent learning, but also presents pedagogical challenges. Students require structured support in research skills, source analysis, and academic writing, whilst maintaining the independence that the assessment demands.

Common pitfalls in the NEA include questions that are too broad to address substantively within the word limit, over-reliance on narrative rather than analysis, failure to engage adequately with interpretations, and poor integration of primary source evaluation into the argument.

## Subject Content Options

Each awarding body offers a range of topics across different historical periods, allowing centres to construct coherent programmes of study that reflect staff expertise, student interests, and the desire to provide breadth across time and geography.

### Breadth Study Options

Typical breadth studies include:

- **The Tudors** (1485-1603): Covering the reigns from Henry VII to Elizabeth I, focusing on political, religious, and social change
- **The Stuarts** (1603-1702): Examining the Civil Wars, Interregnum, Restoration, and Glorious Revolution
- **Democracy and Nazism in Germany** (1918-1945): A popular option covering the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich
- **The Making of Modern Britain** (1951-2007): Exploring post-war social, political, and economic transformation
- **The Crusades** (c.1071-1204): Investigating the religious, political, and military dimensions of the Crusading movement
- **Civil Rights and Race Relations in the USA** (1850-2009): Tracing the long struggle for African American equality

### Depth Study Options

Depth studies typically include:

- **France in Revolution** (1774-1815): The collapse of the Ancien Régime, Revolutionary terror, and Napoleonic consolidation
- **The Cold War in Asia** (1945-1993): Focusing on Korea, Vietnam, and superpower rivalry in the region
- **The English Revolution** (1625-1660): From Charles I's personal rule through Civil War to Restoration
- **The Witch Craze** (c.1580-c.1750): Investigating the social, religious, and intellectual dimensions of witch-hunting
- **The Holocaust**: The persecution and murder of European Jews under Nazi rule
- **The Birth of the USA** (1760-1801): From colonial protest through revolution to early republic

The selection of topics should be guided by considerations of coherence, staff expertise, resource availability, and the desire to provide students with genuine historical breadth across chronological periods and geographical regions.

## Pedagogical Considerations

### Teaching for Conceptual Understanding

A Level History demands that students operate with disciplinary concepts at a sophisticated level. Teachers must move beyond simply defining terms like 'causation' or 'significance' to exploring how these concepts function in historical practice.

Christine Counsell's work on 'residue' is particularly relevant here. Students need to understand that second-order concepts are not merely analytical tools applied to historical content, but ways of thinking that shape how we understand the past itself. A causal explanation is not just a list of factors but an argument about how and why change occurs.

Effective pedagogy involves:

- Making concepts explicit through modelling and metacognitive discussion
- Providing opportunities for students to apply concepts across different contexts
- Encouraging reflection on how concepts shape historical understanding
- Using exemplars to demonstrate sophisticated conceptual thinking

### Developing Extended Writing

The extended essay format at A Level represents a significant challenge for many students. They must construct arguments that are sustained across 1,000-1,500 words (in examination conditions), maintaining analytical focus whilst deploying detailed supporting evidence.

Strategies for developing extended writing include:

- Modelling the construction of argument at paragraph and whole-essay levels
- Using frameworks and scaffolds that are gradually removed as students develop independence
- Focusing on the quality of analytical moves rather than quantity of information
- Providing regular opportunities for practice with structured feedback
- Teaching effective planning strategies that support coherent argument structure

### Supporting the Transition from GCSE

The step-up from GCSE to A Level History is substantial. Research by the Historical Association indicates that this transition is "one of the hardest stages of their school career" for many students. Teachers must explicitly address the gap between GCSE expectations and A Level demands.

Key areas of focus for transition include:

- **Epistemological understanding**: GCSE often presents history as a body of knowledge to be learned; A Level requires understanding history as an interpretative discipline
- **Analytical depth**: Moving from description to sustained analysis
- **Source evaluation**: From generic 'reliability' comments to sophisticated contextual analysis
- **Independence**: Developing the capacity for independent research and sustained enquiry

Many successful departments implement transition programmes that explicitly introduce A Level approaches in the summer term of Year 11 or the autumn term of Year 12, focusing on conceptual foundations, historiographical awareness, and the habits of mind required for advanced historical study.

### Addressing Assessment Objectives Explicitly

While integrated approaches to teaching history are valuable, students need explicit understanding of how assessment objectives operate in practice. They should be able to identify when they are working to AO1, AO2, or AO3, and understand the specific requirements of each.

This does not mean reducing history to formulaic responses, but rather ensuring students understand what is being asked of them. Effective teaching makes assessment criteria transparent whilst maintaining the intellectual integrity of historical enquiry.

## Common Student Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: History is a Collection of Facts

Many students enter A Level believing that historical knowledge consists of an objective record of 'what happened'. They struggle with the interpretative nature of history, expecting there to be 'right answers' rather than reasoned arguments supported by evidence.

Addressing this requires explicit teaching about the nature of historical knowledge, introducing students to genuine historical debate, and modelling how historians construct arguments from evidence.

### Misconception 2: Sources Can Be Simply Categorised as Reliable or Unreliable

GCSE approaches to sources often encourage categorisation exercises—identifying bias and making reliability judgements. At A Level, students must understand that sources are valuable for different purposes and that bias itself may be historically significant.

Teaching should emphasise the contextual analysis of sources—understanding them as products of specific circumstances—and their utility for particular historical enquiries.

### Misconception 3: Historians Disagree Because They Have Different Facts

Students often imagine that historical debate arises from historians knowing different things. They need to understand that historians generally work from a shared body of evidence but construct different interpretations through different questions, methodologies, theoretical frameworks, and value judgements.

This understanding is fundamental to AO3. Students must learn to identify the arguments within interpretations, evaluate the reasoning and evidence supporting those arguments, and form reasoned judgements about their validity.

### Misconception 4: Strong Essays Include Everything Known About a Topic

Students frequently believe that comprehensive coverage of content demonstrates knowledge and understanding. In fact, A Level rewards selective deployment of evidence in support of analytical argument. The quality of analysis and the relevance of supporting evidence matter more than the quantity of information provided.

Teaching should emphasise the construction of argument, modelling how evidence is selected and deployed to support specific analytical points.

### Misconception 5: The NEA is an Extended Essay

Students often approach the Historical Investigation as they would an extended essay, failing to recognise the specific requirements for independent research, source analysis, and engagement with interpretations. They may produce competent narrative accounts that fail to meet the assessment objectives for the component.

Clear scaffolding, exemplar analysis, and explicit attention to the distinctive demands of the NEA are essential for success.

## Challenges and Opportunities

### Recruitment and Retention

Data from the Historical Association and JCQ indicates that A Level History, whilst remaining a popular subject, has faced recruitment challenges in recent years. The "step up" from GCSE can be daunting, and some students are deterred by perceptions of heavy reading loads and demanding essay requirements.

Successful departments address this through:

- Effective transition programmes that build confidence
- Clear communication about the demands and rewards of A Level study
- Engaging teaching that maintains intellectual rigour whilst supporting student development
- Explicit focus on developing the skills that lead to success

### The Linear Structure

The move to linear A Levels presents both challenges and opportunities. Students must retain knowledge and skills across two years without modular assessment to consolidate learning. However, the linear structure also permits more coherent curriculum planning and removes the pressure of repeated examination windows.

Teaching approaches need to address long-term retention through regular retrieval practice, spaced review of prior content, and explicit connections between topics studied at different points in the course.

### The NEA and Academic Integrity

The independent nature of the Historical Investigation presents challenges for academic integrity. Students must receive sufficient support to develop their research and writing skills whilst maintaining the independence that the assessment requires.

Clear guidance from awarding bodies, departmental policies that distinguish legitimate support from inappropriate assistance, and explicit teaching of academic referencing and citation practices are essential.
