# Formative Assessment in History

Formative assessment—often used interchangeably with the term "assessment for learning"—is a pedagogical approach that involves gathering evidence of pupil learning during the instructional process to identify strengths and weaknesses, and subsequently adjusting teaching and learning activities to better meet pupil needs. In history education, formative assessment serves a particularly crucial function because it enables teachers to diagnose pupils' developing historical thinking, uncover misconceptions about the past, and provide targeted feedback that advances disciplinary understanding.

## The Theoretical Foundations of Formative Assessment

### Black and Wiliam's Seminal Research

The modern conceptualisation of formative assessment in British education owes much to the groundbreaking work of Paul Black and Dylan Wiliam. Their 1998 pamphlet *Inside the Black Box: Raising Standards Through Classroom Assessment* synthesised extensive research evidence and demonstrated that formative assessment practices could produce learning gains equivalent to an effect size of 0.4 to 0.7—larger than most other educational interventions. This finding was revolutionary because it showed that improvements in assessment practice, rather than changes to curriculum content or teaching methods alone, could dramatically raise pupil achievement.

Black and Wiliam defined formative assessment as "encompassing all those activities undertaken by teachers, and by their students in assessing themselves, that provide information to be used as feedback to modify teaching and learning activities." This definition highlights several features that remain central to effective formative assessment in history classrooms today: the active involvement of pupils in self-assessment, the collection of evidence about learning, and the use of that evidence to adapt instruction.

The researchers identified five key strategies that constitute effective formative assessment:

1. **Clarifying and sharing learning intentions and criteria for success**—ensuring pupils understand what they are learning and what quality work looks like
2. **Engineering effective classroom discussions, questions, and learning tasks**—using pedagogical techniques that elicit evidence of learning
3. **Providing feedback that moves learners forward**—giving specific, actionable guidance rather than generic praise or grades
4. **Activating students as learning resources for one another**—employing peer assessment and collaborative learning structures
5. **Activating students as owners of their own learning**—developing pupil self-assessment capabilities

Each of these strategies presents particular opportunities and challenges when applied to history education, given the discipline's distinctive combination of substantive knowledge and disciplinary thinking.

### The Distinction Between Formative and Summative Assessment

A fundamental principle underlying effective assessment practice is the distinction between formative and summative purposes. Summative assessment seeks to evaluate learning at a particular point in time—typically for reporting, certification, or accountability purposes. National examinations, end-of-topic tests, and reported assessment grades serve summative functions. Formative assessment, by contrast, is designed to support learning as it unfolds. Its purpose is diagnostic and responsive: to reveal what pupils understand, identify gaps and misconceptions, and inform immediate instructional decisions.

This distinction matters profoundly for history teaching because the pressure of high-stakes examinations can distort classroom assessment toward summative purposes. When teachers prioritise examination preparation over learning, assessment becomes focused on predicting grades rather than advancing understanding. Christine Counsell has argued that this tendency represents a fundamental threat to history education, narrowing the curriculum and reducing historical study to the accumulation of testable content rather than the development of sophisticated historical thinking.

The Ofsted history subject report *Rich Encounters with the Past* (2023) identified this risk explicitly, noting that when assessment regimes become too focused on summative outcomes, teachers may lose sight of the most important content and concepts pupils need to know. The report found that some teachers were not effectively identifying or addressing gaps in pupil knowledge because their assessment practices were oriented toward data collection rather than learning improvement.

## Formative Assessment in History: Unique Considerations

### Assessing Historical Thinking

History is distinctive among school subjects because its learning objectives involve not merely the acquisition of factual knowledge but the development of disciplinary thinking. Pupils must learn to construct historical arguments, evaluate evidence, understand causation, analyse change and continuity, and assess historical significance. These disciplinary processes cannot be assessed through simple factual recall tests; they require sophisticated assessment approaches that reveal the quality of pupils' historical reasoning.

Effective formative assessment in history must therefore probe beneath surface-level knowledge to uncover how pupils are thinking about the past. This involves:

- **Eliciting pupils' causal reasoning**—asking not just "what caused X?" but "why do you think that was the most important cause?"
- **Assessing evidential understanding**—exploring how pupils use sources and whether they recognise their limitations
- **Evaluating interpretations**—determining whether pupils can identify different historical accounts and explain why historians disagree
- **Probing chronological understanding**—checking whether pupils can place events in sequence and understand the relationships between them
- **Investigating contextual knowledge**—assessing whether pupils understand the specific circumstances of past societies rather than merely memorising facts

Each of these dimensions requires assessment techniques that go beyond traditional testing. They demand opportunities for pupils to articulate their thinking, whether through discussion, extended writing, or structured tasks that make reasoning visible.

### The Challenge of Prior Conceptions

Research in history education has consistently demonstrated that pupils arrive in classrooms with preconceptions about the past—ideas derived from family stories, popular media, community traditions, and previous schooling. These prior conceptions can be remarkably persistent and may conflict with historical interpretations pupils encounter in lessons.

Formative assessment serves a vital function in uncovering these preconceptions. Without diagnostic assessment, teachers may assume pupils have understood material when in fact they have assimilated it into existing mental frameworks that distort historical understanding. For example, a pupil might "learn" about the causes of the First World War while retaining a fundamental assumption that historical events have single, identifiable causes—a preconception that undermines their ability to understand the complex origins of the conflict.

Effective formative assessment in history therefore requires techniques that make pupils' thinking visible. This might involve:

- **Anticipation guides**—asking pupils to agree or disagree with statements about a topic before study begins, then revisiting these responses after instruction
- **Concept cartoons**—presenting pupils with different characters expressing views about a historical issue and asking which they agree with and why
- **Prediction tasks**—showing pupils an incomplete source or account and asking them to predict what comes next, revealing their assumptions about historical causation
- **Diamond ranking**—asking pupils to prioritise causes, consequences, or factors, then explaining their reasoning
- **Think-aloud protocols**—having pupils verbalise their thinking as they analyse sources or construct arguments

### The Role of Disciplinary Knowledge

Christine Counsell has developed influential frameworks for understanding the relationship between knowledge and assessment in history. She argues that historical knowledge operates at different scales—residual knowledge (familiar, readily recalled), hinterland knowledge (contextual, enabling understanding), and topic knowledge (specific to particular enquiries). Effective formative assessment must be sensitive to these different types of knowledge and their roles in enabling historical thinking.

A pupil might demonstrate weak performance on a task not because they lack historical thinking skills but because they lack the residual knowledge required to engage with the topic. Conversely, a pupil might appear to think historically when in fact they are merely reproducing learned narratives. Formative assessment must therefore probe the relationship between what pupils know and how they think, diagnosing whether difficulties stem from knowledge gaps, conceptual confusion, or procedural unfamiliarity.

## Key Strategies for Formative Assessment in History

### Questioning for Historical Understanding

Classroom questioning is perhaps the most widely used formative assessment technique, yet its effectiveness varies dramatically depending on how it is employed. In history classrooms, effective questioning should probe disciplinary thinking rather than merely testing recall.

**Elicitation questions** are designed to reveal what pupils know and think. Rather than asking closed questions with predetermined answers, elicitation questions invite pupils to articulate their understanding:
- "What do you already know about...?"
- "Why do you think that happened?"
- "How is this similar to or different from...?"

**Probing questions** follow up on pupil responses to uncover reasoning:
- "What makes you say that?"
- "Can you give an example?"
- "What evidence supports that view?"

**Challenging questions** push pupils to develop their thinking:
- "But if that's true, how do we explain...?"
- "What would someone who disagreed say?"
- "How certain can we be about that?"

**Reorienting questions** help pupils make connections:
- "How does this relate to what we learned about...?"
- "Would this explanation work for other situations?"

The Historical Association emphasises that wait time is crucial for effective questioning in history. When teachers allow several seconds of thinking time after asking a question, pupil responses become longer, more confident, and more historically sophisticated. This is particularly important for historical questions, which often require pupils to marshal evidence and construct arguments rather than simply retrieve facts.

### Diagnostic Assessment Tasks

Structured tasks can provide systematic evidence of pupil learning across a class. In history, effective diagnostic tasks are designed to reveal specific aspects of historical thinking:

**Source analysis tasks** might present pupils with a historical source and ask them to identify what it reveals, what it conceals, and what questions it raises. The responses reveal pupils' understanding of source provenance, bias, and utility.

**Causal explanation tasks** might ask pupils to select the most important cause of an event from a list and justify their choice, or to rank causes by significance. These tasks reveal whether pupils can distinguish between immediate and underlying causes, and whether they understand the concept of historical significance.

**Interpretation tasks** might present pupils with two contrasting historical accounts and ask them to explain why historians differ. These tasks assess pupils' understanding that historical interpretations reflect historians' questions, contexts, and perspectives.

**Chronological reasoning tasks** might ask pupils to sequence events and explain the relationships between them, revealing their understanding of causation and change over time.

The Nuffield Primary History project developed diagnostic assessment frameworks that map pupil responses to levels of historical thinking, enabling teachers to identify where individual pupils are in their development and plan instruction accordingly.

### Feedback That Advances Historical Learning

Providing effective feedback is one of the most challenging aspects of formative assessment. Research by Black and Wiliam, subsequently developed by John Hattie and others, has identified characteristics of feedback that supports learning:

**Specific rather than general**—Feedback should identify particular aspects of performance and specific steps for improvement. Rather than "good essay," effective feedback might say, "Your explanation of economic causes is well-supported with evidence; now consider how political factors interacted with these."

**Focused on the task, not the person**—Feedback should address the work rather than attributing qualities to the pupil. "This conclusion doesn't follow from the evidence presented" is more useful than "you're not good at conclusions."

**Timely**—Feedback is most effective when provided while pupils are still engaged with the task and can act on it. This presents challenges in history, where extended writing may take days to mark. Strategies such as feedback during the drafting process, or whole-class feedback on common issues, can address this challenge.

**Forward-looking**—Effective feedback focuses on how to improve future performance rather than merely evaluating past performance. It answers the question "what's next?" for the learner.

In history specifically, feedback should attend to both substantive content and disciplinary thinking. A teacher might provide feedback on the accuracy of historical knowledge while simultaneously commenting on the quality of argumentation, use of evidence, or understanding of historical concepts.

### Peer and Self-Assessment

Activating pupils as learning resources for one another and as owners of their own learning are two of Black and Wiliam's key strategies. In history education, these approaches can be particularly powerful because historical reasoning is inherently dialogic—historians develop understanding through debate and peer review.

**Peer assessment** in history might involve:
- Pupils evaluating each other's source analyses using structured criteria
- Partners discussing historical interpretations and challenging each other's evidence
- Group evaluation of historical arguments against disciplinary standards

For peer assessment to be effective, pupils need clear understanding of what quality historical work looks like. This can be developed through the use of exemplars, co-constructed success criteria, and explicit teaching about disciplinary standards.

**Self-assessment** involves pupils evaluating their own learning against clear criteria. In history, this might include:
- Pupils reflecting on their understanding of a topic before and after study
- Self-evaluation of written work against disciplinary criteria
- Pupils identifying their own questions and areas for further investigation

Robin Conway's work on student-led enquiry in history demonstrates how self-assessment can be integrated into extended projects, with pupils taking responsibility for planning, teaching elements of the curriculum, and evaluating their own learning.

## Formative Assessment Across Key Stages

### Primary History (Key Stages 1 and 2)

In primary history, formative assessment must be age-appropriate while still attending to the discipline's distinctive features. The Ofsted history subject report noted that in some primary schools, assessment focused too heavily on generic skills (such as "I can ask questions") without sufficient attention to historical content and concepts.

Effective formative assessment in primary history:
- Uses observation and discussion as primary assessment tools
- Focuses on developing chronological understanding and awareness of change over time
- Uses stories and narratives as contexts for assessing historical thinking
- Employs concrete, age-appropriate tasks (such as sorting pictures, sequencing events, or using objects as evidence)
- Builds vocabulary that enables pupils to articulate historical thinking

The Nuffield Primary History resources include extensive guidance on assessing young children's historical learning, emphasising that assessment should be embedded in engaging activities rather than separated from them.

### Secondary History (Key Stages 3 and 4)

As pupils progress through secondary school, formative assessment becomes increasingly sophisticated. At Key Stage 3, assessment should build foundational disciplinary understanding that will support GCSE study, without merely anticipating GCSE requirements.

Effective formative assessment at Key Stage 3:
- Develops pupils' ability to construct extended historical arguments
- Builds understanding of historical interpretations and their origins
- Develops increasingly sophisticated evidential thinking
- Supports the transition from narrative to analytical writing
- Prepares pupils for the demands of disciplinary reading

At GCSE, formative assessment must balance the demands of examination preparation with continued development of historical understanding. This is a particular challenge given the high-stakes nature of GCSE qualifications. Effective practice includes:
- Using examination-style questions formatively, with feedback focused on learning rather than grade prediction
- Maintaining attention to historical thinking alongside examination technique
- Ensuring that test preparation does not narrow the curriculum or reduce historical study to formulaic responses

The Historical Association's work on progression and assessment emphasises that Key Stage 3 should not become merely preparation for GCSE. Formative assessment at this stage should develop broad historical literacy and engagement with the discipline, not merely rehearse examination responses.

### Post-16 History

At A Level, formative assessment should support the development of independent historical thinking. Pupils are expected to engage with historical debates, evaluate interpretations critically, and conduct independent research.

Effective formative assessment at this level:
- Supports the development of independent research skills
- Develops pupils' ability to engage critically with historiographical debates
- Provides feedback on the structure and argumentation of extended essays
- Supports the development of sophisticated evidential reasoning
- Prepares pupils for the demands of university-level historical study

## Common Challenges and Misconceptions

### The Data Collection Trap

A persistent challenge in implementing formative assessment is the confusion between formative purposes and data collection. When school systems require teachers to record frequent assessment grades or track pupil progress through numerical data, assessment can become focused on generating numbers rather than supporting learning.

This is particularly problematic in history, where the complexity of historical thinking resists reduction to simple metrics. A pupil's understanding of historical causation cannot be validly represented by a single grade or level. When teachers are required to generate such data, they may resort to assessments that test superficial knowledge rather than probe deep understanding.

Effective formative assessment in history requires assessment systems that prioritise quality of information over quantity of data. This may mean less frequent recorded assessment, with greater emphasis on embedded, informal assessment that informs immediate teaching decisions.

### The Generic Skills Fallacy

Another common misconception is that formative assessment can focus on generic skills without attention to disciplinary content. History teachers are sometimes encouraged to assess generic "thinking skills" or "enquiry skills" that are supposedly transferable across subjects.

Research in history education demonstrates that historical thinking is inextricably bound to historical knowledge. Pupils cannot demonstrate causal reasoning in the abstract; they can only reason causally about specific historical events, drawing on their knowledge of those events. Assessment that focuses on generic skills divorced from content fails to assess the discipline accurately and may produce misleading information about pupil learning.

### The Levelling Legacy

The previous National Curriculum level descriptors in history were widely criticised for encouraging shallow assessment practices. The removal of statutory levels was intended to free teachers to develop more sophisticated approaches to assessment. However, the legacy of levelling persists in some schools through the use of replacement grading systems or progress tracking tools that replicate the problems of levels.

The Ofsted history subject report noted that in some schools, assessment practices still focused on allocating pupils to categories rather than diagnosing learning needs and planning responsive instruction. Effective formative assessment requires moving beyond categorisation toward detailed understanding of what pupils know and can do.

### Misconceptions About Historical Knowledge

Formative assessment in history must attend to common misconceptions that pupils hold about the past. These include:

**Presentism**—The tendency to judge past societies by present-day values and assumptions
**Teleological thinking**—The belief that historical events were inevitable or happened "in order to" achieve later outcomes
**Great man history**—The assumption that history is primarily shaped by the actions of exceptional individuals rather than broader social and economic forces
**Source naivety**—The belief that historical sources either tell the whole truth or are entirely unreliable, without understanding the complexities of source evaluation
**Anachronism**—The projection of modern concepts and categories onto past societies

Effective formative assessment identifies these misconceptions and provides feedback that challenges them, supporting pupils in developing more sophisticated historical understanding.

## Integrating Formative Assessment with Curriculum Planning

### Assessment-Led Curriculum Design

Christine Counsell has argued that curriculum and assessment should be designed together, with assessment serving curriculum purposes rather than being added as an afterthought. This means designing enquiries and units with clear learning intentions and identifying in advance how pupils' developing understanding will be assessed.

In practice, this involves:
- Identifying the key historical knowledge and concepts pupils will develop through an enquiry
- Determining what quality performance looks like at different stages
- Planning specific points where assessment will occur
- Designing tasks that elicit
In practice, this involves:
- Identifying the key historical knowledge and concepts pupils will develop through an enquiry
- Determining what quality performance looks like at different stages
- Planning specific points where assessment will occur
- Designing tasks that elicit the full range of intended learning
- Preparing feedback strategies that will advance pupil understanding

### Formative Assessment in Historical Enquiries

The enquiry-based approach to history teaching, advocated by the Historical Association and exemplified in resources such as the Nuffield Primary History project and Secondary History matters, provides an ideal structure for embedding formative assessment. Each enquiry can be designed with built-in assessment opportunities that reveal pupils' developing understanding.

At the beginning of an enquiry, diagnostic assessment can establish pupils' prior knowledge and identify preconceptions that may need to be addressed. During the enquiry, ongoing assessment through questioning and tasks can reveal how pupils are developing their understanding and where additional support or challenge may be needed. At the conclusion of the enquiry, assessment can evaluate pupils' achievement of the learning intentions while also identifying areas for future development.

### Using Exemplars and Model Responses

The use of exemplars—examples of work that illustrate different levels of quality—is a powerful tool for formative assessment. By examining exemplars, pupils develop understanding of what quality historical work looks like and can apply this understanding to their own performance.

Effective use of exemplars involves:
- Presenting multiple examples that illustrate different qualities of historical thinking
- Engaging pupils in discussion about what makes particular work effective
- Helping pupils identify specific features that contribute to quality (such as use of evidence, consideration of multiple perspectives, or clear argumentation)
- Supporting pupils in applying these criteria to their own work through self-assessment

Research by the Assessment Reform Group and subsequent work by the Education Endowment Foundation has demonstrated that the use of exemplars, combined with peer and self-assessment, can significantly improve pupil achievement.

## Conclusion

Formative assessment in history education is not merely a technical procedure for collecting data about pupil learning; it is a fundamental dimension of effective pedagogy that enables teachers to understand and advance pupils' developing historical thinking. By revealing what pupils know, understand, and can do, formative assessment supports responsive teaching that addresses individual needs and moves all pupils forward in their historical learning.

The distinctive nature of history as a discipline—with its combination of substantive knowledge and disciplinary thinking—requires assessment approaches that go beyond simple factual recall. Effective formative assessment in history probes beneath surface-level knowledge to uncover how pupils are thinking about the past, identifies misconceptions that may distort understanding, and provides feedback that advances disciplinary learning.

As Christine Counsell has argued, assessment should serve curriculum purposes rather than driving them. When formative assessment is integrated with curriculum design and employed with the sophistication required by the discipline of history, it becomes a powerful tool for developing pupils' historical understanding and fostering their engagement with the past.
