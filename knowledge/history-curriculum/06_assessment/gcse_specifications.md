# GCSE History Specifications

## Overview

GCSE History qualifications in England are offered by three main awarding bodies: AQA (Assessment and Qualifications Alliance), Pearson Edexcel, and OCR (Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations). Each board provides distinct specifications that comply with the Department for Education's statutory subject content requirements whilst offering different thematic options, assessment structures, and pedagogical approaches. Understanding the specifications' architecture is essential for curriculum leaders and teachers when making strategic decisions about programme design, resource allocation, and assessment preparation.

The GCSE History qualification was reformed for first teaching in September 2016, with first assessments in summer 2018. The reformed qualifications introduced a linear structure (all examinations at the end of the course), the 9–1 grading system, and strengthened requirements for the study of British history. All specifications must adhere to the DfE's GCSE Subject Content document (April 2014), which mandates minimum content coverage across eras, scales, and geographical contexts.

## DfE Statutory Requirements

### Mandatory Content Coverage

The Department for Education's GCSE History Subject Content (2014) establishes non-negotiable requirements that all awarding bodies must incorporate into their specifications. These requirements ensure breadth and coherence in students' historical study whilst preserving sufficient flexibility for schools to construct programmes aligned with their contexts and resources.

#### The Three Eras Requirement

All GCSE History specifications must require students to study history across **three distinct eras**:

- **Medieval (c.500–c.1500)**: This era encompasses the period from the fall of the Western Roman Empire through to the late fifteenth century, including topics such as the Norman Conquest, medieval monarchy, religious change, and the Black Death
- **Early Modern (c.1450–c.1750)**: Spanning from the Renaissance through to the mid-eighteenth century, covering the Reformation, the English Civil War, the rise of parliamentary power, and early colonial expansion
- **Modern (c.1700–present day)**: From the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution through to contemporary history, including empire, world wars, and social change

This tripartite structure ensures that students encounter historical change across extended timescales, developing understanding of how societies transform over centuries rather than merely studying disconnected episodes.

#### The Three Scales Requirement

Specifications must incorporate study at **three different scales**:

- **Depth studies**: Intensive examination of a relatively short period, typically 20–50 years, allowing students to understand complexity, nuance, and the interplay of multiple factors within a confined timeframe
- **Period studies**: Broader investigation spanning several decades or centuries, enabling students to trace longer-term developments and patterns of change and continuity
- **Thematic studies**: Examination of a particular theme (such as warfare, migration, or power) across an extended timescale, often centuries, developing understanding of how phenomena persist and transform across eras

This multi-scalar approach develops students' capacity to navigate between detailed contextual understanding and broader historical patterns—a disciplinary skill essential for sophisticated historical thinking.

#### Geographical Coverage Requirements

Students must study history from **three geographical contexts**:

- **British history**: Must constitute **a minimum of 40% of assessed content** across the full course. This requirement, introduced in the 2014 reforms, represents a significant strengthening from previous arrangements and reflects government priorities regarding national identity and cultural literacy
- **European history (including wider world contexts)**: Must also constitute a minimum of 40% of assessed content, ensuring students develop understanding of Britain's relationship with continental Europe and global contexts
- **Wider world history**: Incorporated within or alongside the European requirement, covering histories beyond Europe including Africa, Asia, the Americas, and the Middle East

The 40% British history minimum is a distinctive feature of the reformed GCSE and has significant implications for curriculum planning. Teachers must ensure that their selected options across all papers cumulatively meet this threshold, taking care that apparently "British" topics (such as the British Empire) may count toward the wider world requirement depending on the specification's classification.

#### The Five Elements Requirement

All specifications must require students to study each of the following elements:

1. **A thematic study**: Examining a theme across a substantial period of at least 200 years
2. **A period study**: Covering a substantial timescale of at least 50 years
3. **A study of the historic environment**: Focused investigation of a specific site, building, or location, connecting physical remains with historical understanding
4. **A British depth study**: Intensive investigation of a discrete period in British history
5. **A non-British depth study**: Comparable intensive study of a period outside Britain

These five elements ensure that students encounter diverse historical approaches and develop versatile analytical capabilities.

## AQA GCSE History (8145)

### Specification Structure

AQA's GCSE History specification is the most widely adopted in England, chosen by approximately two-thirds of schools. Its structure divides assessment into two equally weighted papers, each contributing 50% to the final grade. This binary structure offers clarity for curriculum planning whilst requiring careful sequencing to ensure logical progression between topics.

#### Paper 1: Understanding the Modern World

**Time allocation**: 2 hours written examination
**Total marks**: 52
**Weighting**: 50% of GCSE

Paper 1 comprises two sections, both mandatory:

**Section A: Period Studies (1B–1N)**
- Students study one period study from a choice of eleven options
- Options include: Germany 1890–1945, Russia 1894–1945, America 1920–1973, Asia 1950–2005, and others
- Assessment focuses on AO1 (knowledge and understanding) and AO2 (explanation and analysis using second-order concepts)
- Key second-order concepts emphasised: causation, change and continuity, similarity and difference

**Section B: Wider World Depth Studies (21–29)**
- Students study one depth study from a choice of nine options
- Options include: Conflict and Tension 1918–1939 (First World War aftermath), Conflict and Tension 1945–1972 (Cold War), Conflict and Tension between East and West 1945–1991, and others
- This section incorporates explicit assessment of AO3 (source analysis and evaluation)
- Students encounter contemporary sources and must evaluate their utility and reliability for specific enquiries

The Paper 1 structure enables schools to construct coherent programmes by linking period studies with complementary depth studies—for instance, pairing Germany 1890–1945 with Conflict and Tension 1918–1939 to create an integrated First World War to Second World War narrative.

#### Paper 2: Shaping the Nation

**Time allocation**: 2 hours written examination
**Total marks**: 52
**Weighting**: 50% of GCSE

Paper 2 also comprises two sections:

**Section A: Thematic Studies (20–27)**
- Students study one thematic study from a choice of eight options
- Themes include: Britain Health and the People c.1000–present, Britain Power and the People c.1170–present, Britain Migration Empires and the People c.790–present
- Each thematic study spans at least 800 years, requiring students to trace long-term patterns of change, continuity, cause, and consequence
- The thematic studies explicitly assess AO1 and AO2, with particular emphasis on change and continuity over extended periods

**Section B: British Depth Studies Including the Historic Environment (20–27)**
- Students study one British depth study that incorporates the historic environment requirement
- Options include: Norman England c.1066–c.1100, Medieval England 1272–1307, Elizabethan England c.1568–1603
- Each depth study includes a specific historic environment focus—particular sites, buildings, or locations that students must study in detail
- For example, the Norman England option includes study of either Winchester, London, or Durham Cathedral depending on the specific paper
- This section assesses AO1, AO2, and AO3, with sources including both contemporary accounts and material remains from the historic environment itself

### Assessment Objectives Weighting (AQA)

| Assessment Objective | Description | Weighting |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------|
| AO1 | Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of key features and characteristics | 35% |
| AO2 | Explain and analyse using second-order concepts | 35% |
| AO3 | Analyse, evaluate, and use sources | 20% |
| AO4 | Analyse, evaluate, and make substantiated judgements about interpretations | 10% |

AO4 is distributed across both papers through questions requiring students to evaluate historians' interpretations or competing historical claims. This relatively low AO4 weighting compared to some specifications influences teaching priorities, though Ofsted's emphasis on disciplinary rigour suggests that substantive engagement with historical interpretation remains pedagogically essential regardless of assessment weighting.

### Strategic Considerations for AQA

The AQA specification's popularity stems from several factors:

- **Coherent thematic options**: The thematic studies (particularly Health and the People) offer clear narratives that support student engagement and retention
- **Explicit source work**: The dedicated AO3 sections provide structured opportunities for developing source analysis skills
- **Manageable historic environment**: The site-specific focus within British depth studies allows concentrated preparation rather than dispersed attention across multiple locations
- **Resource abundance**: As the market leader, AQA benefits from extensive published resources, past papers, and examiner guidance

However, curriculum leaders should note:

- The **40% British history requirement** demands careful calculation when selecting options, as some apparently British topics (such as empire-focused thematic studies) may not fully count toward the British requirement
- The **two-year linear assessment** places significant pressure on memory and revision strategies, requiring deliberate curriculum design to support retention
- The **absence of coursework or controlled assessment** means all historical skills must be demonstrated under examination conditions

## Pearson Edexcel GCSE History (1HI0)

### Specification Structure

Pearson Edexcel offers a three-paper structure that provides greater flexibility in topic selection whilst maintaining compliance with DfE requirements. The three-paper model allows for more topics to be studied in depth, though with reduced weighting per paper.

#### Paper 1: Thematic Study and Historic Environment

**Time allocation**: 1 hour 15 minutes written examination
**Total marks**: 52
**Weighting**: 30% of GCSE

Paper 1 uniquely combines the thematic study with the historic environment requirement:

- Students study one thematic study from a choice of four options: Medicine in Britain c.1250–present, Warfare and British Society c.1250–present, Migration in Britain c.800–present, or the American West c.1835–c.1895
- The historic environment is **linked directly to the thematic study**, providing coherence. For example, the Medicine option includes study of the British sector of the Western Front 1914–1918; the Warfare option includes study of London and the Second World War
- This linked structure promotes thematic coherence and enables teachers to contextualise the historic environment within broader historical narratives
- Assessment covers AO1, AO2, and AO3

#### Paper 2: Period Study and British Depth Study

**Time allocation**: 1 hour 50 minutes written examination
**Total marks**: 64
**Weighting**: 40% of GCSE

Paper 2 combines period and depth studies:

**Period Study (P1–P6)**
- Students study one period study from options including: Spain and the 'New World' c.1490–c.1555, British America 1713–1783, The American West c.1835–c.1895
- These studies span substantial periods (typically 50–100 years)

**British Depth Study (B1–B4)**
- Students study one British depth study: Anglo-Saxon and Norman England c.1060–1088, The Reigns of King Richard I and King John 1189–1216, Henry VIII and His Ministers 1509–1540, or Early Elizabethan England 1558–1588
- The depth studies require intensive knowledge of relatively short periods

The combined paper structure enables questions that make explicit connections between the period and depth studies, rewarding students who can synthesise knowledge across topics.

#### Paper 3: Modern Depth Study

**Time allocation**: 1 hour 20 minutes written examination
**Total marks**: 52
**Weighting**: 30% of GCSE

Paper 3 focuses exclusively on twentieth-century depth studies:

- Students study one modern depth study from options including: Germany 1918–1939, Russia 1917–1941, The USA 1954–1975 (Conflict at Home and Abroad), or South Africa 1948–1994
- These studies focus intensively on periods of dramatic change, totalitarianism, conflict, or social transformation
- Assessment includes substantial AO3 and AO4 weighting, with source analysis and interpretation evaluation central to this paper

### Assessment Objectives Weighting (Edexcel)

| Assessment Objective | Description | Weighting |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------|
| AO1 | Demonstrate knowledge and understanding | 35% |
| AO2 | Explain and analyse using second-order concepts | 35% |
| AO3 | Analyse, evaluate, and use sources | 15% |
| AO4 | Analyse, evaluate, and make substantiated judgements about interpretations | 15% |

Edexcel's distribution gives slightly higher weighting to AO4 (interpretations) than AQA, reflecting the specification's emphasis on historiographical awareness. This distribution influences teaching priorities, particularly in Paper 3 where interpretations are explicitly assessed.

### Strategic Considerations for Edexcel

Edexcel's specification offers distinct advantages:

- **Greater topic flexibility**: The three-paper structure accommodates more diverse topic combinations, supporting schools seeking to construct programmes reflecting their students' backgrounds and interests
- **Linked historic environment**: The connection between thematic studies and historic environments supports coherent curriculum planning and deeper contextual understanding
- **Higher AO4 weighting**: Schools prioritising disciplinary rigour and engagement with historical debate may find this distribution aligns with their pedagogical values
- **Modular feel within linear structure**: The three-paper model, whilst still linear, provides more natural break points for revision and intervention

Considerations include:

- The **three-paper model** requires managing more assessment logistics than two-paper alternatives
- **Reduced time per paper** means students must work efficiently; examination technique requires explicit instruction
- The **combined Paper 2** demands students switch between period and depth study thinking within a single examination, requiring flexible retrieval capabilities

## OCR GCSE History

OCR offers two distinct GCSE History specifications, providing schools with genuine choice regarding structure and approach.

### OCR History A (J410): Explaining the Modern World

This specification adopts a narrative approach focused on understanding how the modern world emerged from earlier periods.

#### Component 1: Period Study and Non-British Depth Study

**Time allocation**: 1 hour 45 minutes written examination
**Total marks**: 50
**Weighting**: 25% of GCSE

Students study:
- One period study from options including: International Relations 1918–c.2001, The Monarchy c.1154–c.1216, or The Rise of Islam c.550–c.750
- One non-British depth study linked to the period study, such as: Germany 1925–1955, The Conquest of England 1009–1070, or The Early Normans c.911–c.1022

#### Component 2: British Depth Study and the Historic Environment

**Time allocation**: 1 hour 45 minutes written examination
**Total marks**: 50
**Weighting**: 25% of GCSE

Students study:
- One British depth study: The Norman Conquest 1065–1087, The Elizabethans 1580–1603, or The English Reformation c.1520–c.1550
- The historic environment is embedded within the depth study, with specific sites designated for investigation

#### Component 3: Thematic Study and the Historic Environment (Separate)

**Time allocation**: 1 hour 45 minutes written examination
**Total marks**: 50
**Weighting**: 25% of GCSE

Students study one thematic study:
- Living Under Nazi Rule 1933–1945
- The Viking Expansion c.750–c.1050
- The Crusades c.1095–c.1204
- The Impact of Empire on Britain c.1688–c.1730

Each includes associated historic environment study.

#### Component 4: Topic Study

**Time allocation**: 1 hour written examination
**Total marks**: 50
**Weighting**: 25% of GCSE

Students study one topic from diverse options including: The Middle East c.1945–c.1995, The USA 1945–1974, The Making of America 1789–1900, African Americans c.1620–c.1950.

### OCR History B (J411): Schools History Project

This specification, developed in partnership with the Schools History Project curriculum development group, offers a distinctive pedagogy emphasising enquiry, diversity, and engagement with contested history.

#### Component 1: The People's Health c.1250 to Present with The Norman Conquest 1065–1087

**Time allocation**: 1 hour 45 minutes
**Weighting**: 25%

Combines thematic study of health with a medieval British depth study.

#### Component 2: The Making of America 1789–1900 with The Elizabethans 1580–1603

**Time allocation**: 1 hour 45 minutes
**Weighting**: 25%

Combines the American period study with an early modern British depth study.

#### Component 3: The People's Health c.1250 to Present with Living Under Nazi Rule 1933–1945

**Time allocation**: 1 hour 45 minutes
**Weighting**: 25%

Uniquely combines a thematic study with a modern depth study, enabling connections between long-term patterns and intensive case studies.

#### Component 4: History Around Us (Historic Environment)

**Time allocation**: 1 hour
**Weighting**: 25%

Students investigate a specific historic site through teacher-led fieldwork or intensive case study, with assessment focusing on the site's physical features and historical significance.

### Assessment Objectives Weighting (OCR)

Both OCR specifications distribute assessment objectives as follows:

| Assessment Objective | Description | Weighting |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------|
| AO1 | Demonstrate knowledge and understanding | 25% |
| AO2 | Explain and analyse using second-order concepts | 25% |
| AO3 | Analyse, evaluate, and use sources | 25% |
| AO4 | Analyse, evaluate, and make substantiated judgements about interpretations | 25% |

This evenly balanced distribution is distinctive amongst GCSE History specifications and reflects OCR's commitment to treating all historical competencies as equally valuable.

### Strategic Considerations for OCR

OCR specifications offer:

- **Equitable AO distribution**: The 25:25:25:25 weighting ensures no single skill dominates, supporting holistic curriculum design
- **History B's distinctive pedagogy**: The Schools History Project approach emphasises enquiry questions, diverse narratives, and engagement with how history is constructed
- **Four-paper structure**: Spreads assessment load across multiple sittings, potentially reducing examination pressure

Considerations include:

- **Lower market share** means fewer published resources compared to AQA or Edexcel
- **History B's unique structure** requires careful planning to ensure all components receive adequate attention
- **Component weightings** of 25% each mean underperformance in any single paper significantly impacts overall grades

---

## Assessment Objectives Across All Specifications

### AO1: Knowledge and Understanding

**Common formulation**: Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the key features and characteristics of the periods studied.

AO1 requires students to:
- Deploy accurate historical knowledge with precision regarding dates, events, people, and developments
- Demonstrate understanding of historical context, recognising how circumstances shape events and decisions
- Identify and describe key features of periods, including political, social, economic, and cultural dimensions

**Pedagogical implications**: Teachers must balance breadth (covering all required content) with depth (developing rich contextual understanding). Retrieval practice, knowledge organisers, and regular low-stakes testing support AO1 development.

### AO2: Second-Order Concepts

**Common formulation**: Explain and analyse historical events and periods studied using second-order historical concepts.

The second-order concepts—**causation, consequence, change and continuity, similarity and difference, significance**—are the disciplinary tools historians use to construct arguments about the past.

**Pedagogical implications**: Second-order concepts require explicit teaching. Students need metacognitive awareness of which concept they are applying and how it structures historical explanation. Conceptual vocabulary ("trigger causes," "enabling factors," "turning points") must be taught systematically.

### AO3: Source Analysis and Evaluation

**Common formulation**: Analyse, evaluate, and use sources (contemporary to the period) to make substantiated judgements.

AO3 requires students to:
- Analyse source content, identifying relevant information and inferences
- Evaluate utility—how useful is this source for a specific enquiry?
- Evaluate reliability—how far can we trust this source's account?
- Deploy sources as evidence to support historical arguments

**Pedagogical implications**: Source work is often over-simplified into formulaic "OPCVL" (Origin, Purpose, Content, Values, Limitations) approaches. Effective teaching moves beyond acronyms to develop genuine historical reasoning about how sources were produced, circulated, and preserved.

### AO4: Interpretations

**Common formulation**: Analyse, evaluate, and make substantiated judgements about interpretations (including how and why interpretations differ).

AO4 is the most conceptually demanding objective, requiring students to:
- Recognise that historical accounts are constructed, not discovered
- Identify how interpretations differ and what explains those differences
- Evaluate interpretations using evidence and criteria of sound historical reasoning
- Understand that interpretations change over time as questions, evidence, and perspectives evolve

**Pedagogical implications**: AO4 requires sustained engagement with historiography. Students benefit from encountering multiple accounts of the same events, understanding the contexts in which historians write, and developing their own capacity to weigh competing claims.

## The 9–1 Grading System

### Grade Descriptors

GCSE History uses the reformed 9–1 grading structure, with 9 representing the highest attainment and 1 the lowest. The grades are aligned with specific levels of performance against the assessment objectives.

| Grade | Descriptor |
|-------|------------|
| 9 | Exceptional performance demonstrating comprehensive knowledge, sophisticated analysis, and perceptive evaluation |
| 7–8 | Strong performance with secure knowledge, developed analysis, and effective use of evidence |
| 5–6 | Good performance with solid knowledge and competent analytical skills |
| 4 | Standard pass demonstrating adequate knowledge and basic analytical capability |
| 1–3 | Limited performance with patchy knowledge and underdeveloped analytical skills |

Grade 4 represents a standard pass broadly equivalent to the former grade C. Grade 5 represents a strong pass, positioned between the former C and B grades. The "good pass" (grade 5) is increasingly significant for school accountability measures.

### Grade Boundaries

Grade boundaries are not fixed but determined through the awarding process after each examination series, taking account of paper difficulty and overall candidate performance. However, indicative boundaries suggest that achieving grade 9 typically requires approximately 75% of available marks, though this varies by specification and examination series.

### Implications for Teaching

The 9–1 system, combined with linear assessment, creates significant stakes for final examinations. Unlike modular qualifications where candidates could retake individual units, linear GCSEs require students to demonstrate all learning at a single point. This demands:

- **Robust revision strategies**: Systematic approaches to knowledge retention across two years of study
- **Examination technique**: Explicit instruction in time management, question interpretation, and structured responses
- **Intervention systems**: Early identification and support for students at risk of underperformance

---

## Specification Selection: Decision Factors

### Student Cohort Considerations

**Prior attainment**: Schools with students entering KS4 with strong literacy and analytical skills may thrive with specifications emphasising AO4 (interpretations), such as Edexcel or OCR. Where students need more structured support, AQA's clearer paper boundaries may prove advantageous.

**Student interests**: Specifications offering diverse content options (particularly OCR History B) enable departments to select topics reflecting their students' backgrounds and communities.

**Progression pathways**: Students intending A-level History benefit from specifications providing strong foundations in source analysis and interpretation, regardless of which board is chosen.

### Departmental Capacity

**Resource availability**: AQA's market dominance means abundant textbooks, revision materials, and online resources. Smaller awarding bodies may require departments to develop more materials independently.

**Teacher expertise**: Specifications align with particular historical specialisms. Departments with expertise in early modern history might favour options allowing extensive exploration of that period; those with modern specialists might prioritise twentieth-century depth studies.

**Assessment logistics**: Three-paper and four-paper specifications create more examination timetabling complexity than two-paper alternatives.

### Curriculum Coherence

The relationship between GCSE options and Key Stage 3 curriculum deserves careful attention. Ofsted's inspection framework emphasises curriculum coherence, and departments are increasingly expected to articulate how GCSE builds upon and extends KS3 learning.

**Continuity approaches**: Some departments select GCSE topics explicitly building on KS3 foundations (for example, studying the Norman Conquest at KS3 and Norman England at GCSE).

**Complementary approaches**: Others deliberately select GCSE topics not studied at KS3 to maximise breadth of coverage across the 5–16 curriculum.

There is no universal correct approach, but coherence should be deliberate rather than accidental.

---

## Common Misconceptions and Pedagogical Challenges

### Misconception 1: "The specification is the curriculum"

The specification defines what will be assessed; it does not constitute the curriculum itself. Effective departments use specifications as a framework within which to build rich programmes including:
- Essential contextual knowledge beyond specification minima
- Explicit teaching of disciplinary concepts
- Engagement with historical scholarship and debate
- Development of extended writing and argumentation

### Misconception 2: "Coverage equals understanding"

Rushing through content to "finish the specification" is a common trap. Depth of understanding, not breadth of coverage, determines examination success. Students who have studied fewer topics with greater rigour typically outperform those exposed to more content superficially.

### Misconception 3: "AOs are assessed separately"

Whilst questions target particular AOs, effective historical writing integrates knowledge (AO1), conceptual analysis (AO2), source use (AO3), and awareness of interpretation (AO4) simultaneously. Teaching that compartmentalises objectives produces mechanical, superficial responses.

### Challenge: Managing the 40% British History Requirement

The 40% British history minimum creates complexity because:
- Different topics are classified differently across specifications
- The calculation is based on assessed content, not teaching time
- Some topics (such as empire) occupy ambiguous positions

Departments must carefully audit their selected options to ensure compliance, consulting awarding body guidance where classification is unclear.

### Challenge: Linear Assessment and Retention

The shift from modular to linear assessment requires new approaches to knowledge retention:
- **Spaced retrieval practice**: Regular revisiting of prior learning throughout the course
- **Interleaving**: Mixing topics within revision rather than blocking by paper
- **Synoptic assessment**: Designing internal assessments requiring students to draw connections across the specification
