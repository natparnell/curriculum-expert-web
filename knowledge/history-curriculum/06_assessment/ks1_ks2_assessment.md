# KS1 and KS2 History Assessment

## Introduction: The End of Levels and New Beginnings

The landscape of history assessment in English primary schools underwent a fundamental transformation with the introduction of the 2014 National Curriculum. For the first time since 1991, level descriptions were removed, leaving schools to develop their own approaches to measuring pupil progress in history. The new attainment target states simply that "By the end of each key stage, pupils are expected to know, apply and understand the matters, skills and processes specified in the relevant programme of study."

This shift represents both a challenge and an opportunity for primary history teachers and subject leaders. Without the familiar scaffold of National Curriculum levels, schools must develop robust, subject-specific assessment systems that genuinely support learning rather than merely recording achievement. Ofsted has found that fewer than one quarter of schools have good systems for assessing history at Key Stages 1 and 2, making this one of the most pressing areas for curriculum development in primary schools.

This guide explores evidence-informed approaches to assessment in primary history, drawing on guidance from the Historical Association, Ofsted research, and practical classroom experience from schools that have developed effective systems.

## Understanding the Statutory Context

### The National Curriculum Requirements

The National Curriculum programmes of study for history at KS1 and KS2 set out the statutory content that pupils should encounter. However, the curriculum does not prescribe how this learning should be assessed. The removal of level descriptions means that teachers are no longer required to assign numerical levels or sub-levels to individual pieces of work.

The Historical Association strongly urges teachers not to continue using the previous level descriptors, particularly not in forms that break them down into ill-defined sub-levels or apply them to individual pieces of work. As Ofsted noted in the 2011 report "History for All", "levels were not intended for such minute differentiation or to be used so frequently. They were intended to be used sparingly and holistically to judge several pieces of work at the end of a key stage, or at most at the end of a year. They were never intended to mark individual pieces of work."

### End of Key Stage Teacher Assessment

At the end of Key Stage 1 (Year 2) and Key Stage 2 (Year 6), teachers are required to make statutory teacher assessment judgements in certain subjects. However, history is not among the subjects with statutory teacher assessment frameworks. This means that whilst schools must teach history as part of a broad and balanced curriculum, there is no requirement to report attainment in history to parents or the Department for Education using standardised frameworks.

This absence of statutory assessment can lead to history being given lower priority in assessment systems. Many schools focus their assessment energies on English and mathematics, where statutory testing and teacher assessment frameworks exist. The challenge for history subject leaders is to ensure that assessment in history is meaningful and supports teaching and learning, even without external accountability pressures.

## Assessment Without Levels: Key Principles

### Why Levels Were Problematic

The old National Curriculum levels, introduced in 1995, became the mainstay for assessing pupil progression across all subjects. However, they were originally designed as best-fit, end-of-key-stage judgements. In practice, many schools applied them inappropriately:

- Breaking levels down into sub-levels (e.g., 4a, 4b, 4c) that had no basis in the original design
- Applying levels to individual pieces of work rather than holistic judgements
- Using levels to label pupils rather than describe their learning
- Creating a culture of "level chasing" rather than focusing on conceptual understanding

In history specifically, the levels were often poorly understood and applied mechanically. Teachers would assess a piece of writing about the Romans against a generic "evidence and interpretation" level descriptor, without considering the specific historical thinking demonstrated.

### The Commission on Assessment Without Levels

The Commission on Assessment Without Levels, chaired by John McIntosh and reporting in September 2015, provided important guidance for schools developing new assessment systems. Key recommendations relevant to primary history include:

**Assessment should be rooted in the curriculum.** Schools should assess what they teach, rather than teaching what they can easily assess. In history, this means designing assessment around the substantive and disciplinary knowledge set out in the programmes of study.

**Assessment should support teaching and learning.** The primary purpose of assessment is to help teachers adjust their teaching and help pupils understand their next steps. Assessment systems that are primarily for reporting to senior leaders or parents are less likely to improve outcomes.

**Assessment should be manageable.** Teachers should not spend more time assessing than is valuable for pupils' learning. In primary history, where time is limited, assessment approaches must be efficient and focused.

**Assessment should be valid and reliable.** Validity means assessing what matters in history (chronological understanding, knowledge of periods, historical concepts, enquiry skills). Reliability means that different teachers would make similar judgements about the same work.

## Developing a Progression Model for Primary History

### Understanding Progression in History

Progression in history is not simply about knowing more facts. It involves developing increasingly sophisticated ways of thinking about the past. The Historical Association identifies several dimensions of progression that schools should consider:

**Substantive knowledge:** Pupils' knowledge of historical periods, events, and people becomes richer and more detailed. They develop a broader frame of reference and can make connections across time periods.

**Chronological understanding:** Pupils develop more sophisticated understanding of time, duration, and sequence. They move from knowing that events happened "a long time ago" to understanding specific dates, periods, and relationships between events.

**Disciplinary concepts:** Pupils' understanding of historical concepts (cause and consequence, similarity and difference, change and continuity, significance, evidence, interpretation) becomes more nuanced. They can handle more complex causal chains, evaluate multiple perspectives, and understand why interpretations differ.

**Historical enquiry:** Pupils become more independent in framing questions, selecting sources, and drawing conclusions. They understand the provisional nature of historical knowledge.

### The Spiral Curriculum Model

Progression in history follows a spiral curriculum model, where skills and concepts are revisited continually at ever more sophisticated levels. A pupil might encounter the concept of cause and consequence in Year 1 when exploring why the Great Fire of London spread, again in Year 3 when examining causes of Roman invasion, and again in Year 6 when analysing multiple causes of the Second World War. Each encounter should build upon and deepen previous understanding.

This spiral model has implications for assessment. Teachers should not expect Year 1 pupils to demonstrate the same quality of causal thinking as Year 6 pupils. Instead, assessment should focus on whether pupils are demonstrating age-appropriate thinking that shows progress from previous work.

### Age-Related Expectations

In the absence of National Curriculum levels, many schools have adopted age-related expectation (ARE) frameworks. These typically describe what pupils should know and be able to do by the end of each year or key stage. For history, effective ARE frameworks might include statements such as:

**End of KS1:**
- Can place events and objects in chronological order
- Can identify differences between ways of life in different periods
- Can answer questions using sources of information
- Can recount main events from studied periods

**End of KS2:**
- Can place events, people, and changes into correct periods of time
- Can use dates and terms accurately
- Can describe historical events and changes, identifying causes and consequences
- Can understand that different versions of the past may exist
- Can select and organise information to produce structured work

These expectations should be seen as indicative rather than definitive. Progression is not always linear, and pupils may demonstrate different levels of attainment across different aspects of history.

## Formative Assessment in History

### The Centrality of Formative Assessment

Formative assessment—assessment used to inform teaching and learning—should be at the heart of history assessment in primary schools. The Assessment for Learning (AfL) initiative, central to the government's Primary Strategy, emphasises that effective assessment helps teachers adjust their teaching and helps pupils understand what they need to do to improve.

In history, formative assessment is particularly important because the subject develops conceptual understanding that cannot be captured through simple factual recall. Teachers need ongoing information about pupils' developing historical thinking in order to plan appropriate next steps.

### Speaking and Listening as Assessment Tools

Speaking and listening are central to formative assessment in history. Oral work allows teachers to probe pupils' thinking in ways that written work cannot capture, particularly for younger pupils or those with limited writing skills.

Effective strategies include:

**Historical discussion:** Structured discussions where pupils debate historical questions, evaluate evidence, or consider different perspectives. The teacher's role is to listen, probe with follow-up questions, and note misconceptions or breakthroughs in understanding.

**Hot seating:** Pupils take on the role of historical figures and answer questions in character. This reveals their understanding of period, motivation, and context.

**Think-pair-share:** Pupils consider a question individually, discuss with a partner, then share with the class. This gives all pupils thinking time and allows teachers to circulate and listen to discussions.

**Plenaries:** End-of-lesson discussions that draw together learning and allow teachers to assess what has been understood.

### Strategic Questioning

Questioning is perhaps the most powerful formative assessment tool available to history teachers. Effective historical questioning:

**Probes understanding rather than recall:** Rather than asking "When did the Great Fire of London happen?" (a recall question), a teacher might ask "Why did the Great Fire spread so quickly?" which probes understanding of historical context and causation.

**Uses follow-up questions:** When a pupil gives an answer, the teacher asks "Why do you think that?" or "What evidence supports that view?" to probe the depth of understanding.

**Addresses common misconceptions:** Teachers anticipate misconceptions (e.g., that all Victorians were rich or poor) and use questions to surface and address them.

**Uses wait time:** Teachers give pupils time to think before answering, increasing the quality of responses and giving more pupils opportunity to participate.

### Written Work and Marking

Whilst oral assessment is important, written work remains a key source of evidence about pupils' historical learning. Effective marking in history is subject-specific and focuses on historical thinking rather than generic features like punctuation or handwriting.

Ofsted has criticised generic marking practices where teachers write comments that could apply to any subject (e.g., "Good use of connectives" or "Remember full stops"). In history, marking should address:

- **Historical accuracy:** Are facts correct? Is chronology secure?
- **Historical thinking:** Does the pupil demonstrate understanding of cause, consequence, change, or other concepts?
- **Use of evidence:** Can the pupil support claims with evidence from sources?
- **Historical language:** Is the pupil using appropriate historical vocabulary?

Comment-only marking, where teachers write diagnostic comments without grades or levels, has been shown to be more effective in promoting improvement than marking with grades. Pupils focus on the comments rather than the grade, and are more likely to engage with feedback.

### Peer and Self-Assessment

Developing pupils' capacity to assess their own and others' work is an important goal in history. This involves:

**Sharing success criteria:** Making explicit what quality work in history looks like. This might involve sharing examples of work, creating criteria together with pupils, or using historical enquiry frameworks.

**Structured peer assessment:** Pupils assess each other's work against specific historical criteria (e.g., "Does this answer use evidence from the sources?"). This develops pupils' understanding of quality while giving them insight into alternative approaches.

**Self-reflection:** Pupils evaluate their own work, identifying what they have learned and what they need to improve. This might take the form of written reflections, traffic-light self-assessment, or learning journals.

## Summative Assessment and Standardisation

### The Role of Summative Assessment

Whilst formative assessment should be the primary focus, summative assessment—assessment that summarises achievement at a point in time—has important roles in history:

- Providing information for reporting to parents
- Tracking progress across the school
- Identifying groups of pupils who may need additional support
- Evaluating the effectiveness of the curriculum

However, summative assessment in history is fraught with difficulty. A single piece of written work may not capture a pupil's historical understanding, particularly if writing skills are weak. Judgements based on limited evidence may be unreliable.

### Building a Portfolio Approach

One effective approach to summative assessment is the use of portfolios of work. Rather than making judgements based on single pieces of work, teachers collect evidence across a term or year. This portfolio might include:

- A range of written work showing different types of historical thinking
- Records of oral contributions and discussions
- Responses to historical enquiries
- Evidence of knowledge tests or quizzes

Schools that Ofsted identified as having good assessment systems "are developing portfolios of work to illustrate standards and guide teachers in making accurate age-related assessments."

### Standardisation and Moderation

To ensure reliability in teacher assessment, schools need systems for standardisation and moderation. This involves:

**Internal moderation:** Teachers within the school meet to review work together, discuss standards, and agree on whether work meets age-related expectations. This is particularly valuable for history subject leaders, who can use moderation sessions to develop teachers' understanding of progression.

**External moderation:** Schools work with other schools or local authority advisors to moderate work. This provides an external reference point and helps prevent standards drifting over time.

**Use of exemplification materials:** Published examples of work at different standards (such as those available from the Historical Association or Keystage History) help teachers understand what to look for when assessing.

## Assessment Tasks and Activities

### Designing Effective Assessment Tasks

Assessment tasks in history should be designed to elicit historical thinking, not just factual recall. Effective tasks:

**Are embedded in meaningful contexts:** Rather than asking generic questions, tasks are set within specific historical enquiries that give purpose to the assessment.

**Require pupils to work with sources:** Many assessment tasks should present pupils with historical sources (images, artefacts, documents) and ask them to draw conclusions or evaluate evidence.

**Address disciplinary concepts:** Tasks should assess understanding of historical concepts appropriate to the age group, such as cause and consequence, change and continuity, or historical significance.

**Are manageable for teachers:** Tasks should be focused enough to be marked or assessed within reasonable time constraints.

### Examples of Assessment Task Types

**Source evaluation tasks:** Pupils are presented with historical sources and asked questions such as "What can we learn from this source about...?" "How reliable is this source?" "Why might this source give a one-sided view?"

**Causal explanation tasks:** Pupils are asked to explain why something happened in the past, identifying multiple causes and distinguishing between immediate and long-term factors.

**Similarity and difference tasks:** Pupils compare aspects of life in different periods, identifying what changed and what stayed the same.

**Significance tasks:** Pupils evaluate the significance of particular events, people, or developments, using criteria such as impact, duration, or memorialisation.

**Interpretation tasks:** Pupils encounter different versions of the same historical event and are asked to explain why interpretations might differ.

### Keystage History Assessment Tasks

The Keystage History website provides a wide range of assessment tasks that have been developed and tested by teachers. These tasks typically:

- Are linked to specific National Curriculum topics
- Include mark schemes that describe what to look for at different levels of performance
- Come with examples of pupil work with commentaries
- Focus on specific disciplinary concepts

Using established assessment tasks can save teacher time and ensure that assessment is focused on valid historical learning. However, tasks should be selected to match the school's curriculum and adapted as needed.

## Assessment for Learning Strategies

### Feedback That Moves Learning Forward

Feedback is one of the most powerful influences on learning, but not all feedback is effective. In history, effective feedback:

**Is specific and focused:** Rather than writing extensive comments on every aspect of a piece of work, teachers focus on one or two key areas for improvement that will make the most difference.

**Addresses historical thinking:** Comments focus on the history rather than generic features. "Your explanation of why the Romans invaded is well-supported by evidence from the sources" is more useful than "Good detail."

**Provides next steps:** Pupils know what they need to do to improve. "To improve this answer, you need to explain the consequences of this event, not just describe what happened."

**Is timely:** Feedback is given while the learning is still fresh and can be acted upon.

### Using Assessment Information to Adjust Teaching

The ultimate purpose of formative assessment is to inform teaching decisions. Teachers use assessment information to:

**Adjust the pace of teaching:** If assessment reveals that pupils have already mastered content, the teacher can move on. If pupils are struggling, the teacher may need to revisit or reteach.

**Address misconceptions:** When assessment reveals common misconceptions (e.g., about chronology, causation, or evidence), the teacher plans specific activities to address them.

**Differentiate support:** Assessment identifies pupils who need additional support or extension, allowing the teacher to target intervention.

**Evaluate curriculum effectiveness:** Patterns across classes or year groups may reveal areas of the curriculum that are not working well and need revision.

### Whole-School Approaches

Assessment in history cannot be effective if it operates in isolation. Schools need whole-school approaches that:

**Provide time for moderation:** Teachers need scheduled time to meet and moderate work together.

**Develop teacher expertise:** History subject leaders need opportunities to develop their own and others' understanding of progression and assessment.

**Align assessment with curriculum:** Assessment systems should assess what is taught in the curriculum, not impose external frameworks.

**Ensure manageability:** Senior leaders should monitor workload and ensure that assessment demands are reasonable.

## Challenges and Solutions in Primary History Assessment

### Challenge: Limited Curriculum Time

History often receives limited curriculum time in primary schools, making it difficult to build the evidence base needed for robust assessment.

**Solution:** Focus assessment on key checkpoints within enquiries rather than attempting to assess every lesson. Use efficient assessment strategies such as whole-class response systems or targeted questioning. Build assessment into existing activities rather than adding separate assessment tasks.

### Challenge: Weak Writing Skills

Many pupils, particularly in KS
