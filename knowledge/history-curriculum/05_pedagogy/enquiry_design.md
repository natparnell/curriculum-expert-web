# Enquiry Design in History Teaching

## Introduction: The Centrality of Enquiry

At the heart of effective history pedagogy lies the enquiry question—a carefully crafted device that structures pupils' learning, drives their intellectual curiosity, and ensures that the study of the past remains both rigorous and engaging. As Michael Riley articulated in his seminal 2000 article "Into the Key Stage 3 History Garden," the enquiry question serves as far more than a decorative title for a sequence of lessons; it functions as the organising principle that gives coherence to curriculum planning and meaning to pupils' encounters with the past.

The enquiry-based approach to history teaching has become the dominant paradigm in English schools, endorsed explicitly by the Department for Education and woven into the fabric of the National Curriculum. Ofsted's Research Review Series: History (2021) emphasises that pupils learn how "argument and debate can be underpinned by shared principles of enquiry, and how this can drive and test new knowledge and insight about shared pasts." This recognition of enquiry as both a pedagogical tool and a disciplinary practice reflects decades of development within the history education community.

This knowledge file examines the theory and practice of enquiry design in history teaching, drawing upon the work of leading figures such as Michael Riley, Christine Counsell, and the many practitioners who have contributed to *Teaching History* and other professional publications. It addresses the characteristics of effective enquiry questions, the structure of enquiry sequences, progression across key stages, and the practical considerations that enable teachers to design enquiries that genuinely advance pupils' historical understanding.

## What Is Historical Enquiry?

### Defining the Approach

Historical enquiry, in the context of school history, refers to a sequence of lessons organised around an overarching question that pupils work towards answering. This question functions as what Riley termed a "planning device"—it enables teachers to structure coherent sequences of lessons, building knowledge systematically within well-organised frameworks. The Historical Association notes that "the enquiry question in history teaching is therefore a planning device for teachers, enabling them to structure coherent sequences of lessons, building knowledge systematically within well-organised frameworks."

However, reducing enquiry to merely a planning tool would miss its deeper significance. Enquiry also encapsulates the disciplinary nature of history itself. Historians work enquiry-led: they formulate questions about the past, identify and evaluate evidence, construct arguments, and produce accounts that contribute to ongoing scholarly conversations. When pupils engage with well-designed historical enquiries, they are not merely learning about the past; they are learning how historical knowledge is constructed, contested, and refined.

### The Distinctiveness of Historical Enquiry

Enquiry-based learning appears across the curriculum, but historical enquiry possesses distinctive characteristics that set it apart. First, historical enquiry is necessarily evidence-based. Unlike philosophical enquiry, which may proceed through logical reasoning alone, historical enquiry requires engagement with sources from the past—whether documents, artefacts, images, or oral testimony. The evidential base constrains and enables historical argument in particular ways.

Second, historical enquiry deals with the specific and the particular. While pupils may develop generalisations about historical processes, genuine historical thinking requires attention to the specifics of time and place. An enquiry about "Why did the Russian Revolution happen in 1917?" demands engagement with the particular circumstances of that year, not merely the application of abstract theories about revolution.

Third, historical enquiry acknowledges the provisional nature of historical knowledge. As Christine Counsell has emphasised, enquiry questions should open up space for debate and interpretation rather than seeking predetermined answers. The question "What were the causes of the First World War?" invites a more closed response than "Why is it so difficult to agree on the causes of the First World War?"

## Characteristics of Effective Enquiry Questions

### Riley's Foundational Criteria

Michael Riley's original formulation identified three essential characteristics of effective enquiry questions. These criteria have been regularly revisited and refined by contributors to *Teaching History* over the past 25 years, but they remain foundational to good practice.

**First, the question must be answerable.** This may seem obvious, but many apparently attractive questions prove impossible for pupils to answer meaningfully with the time and resources available. A question such as "Was Henry V a good king?" might engage pupils' interest, but answering it would require investigating multiple dimensions of Henry's reign, comparing him across numerous criteria with other monarchs, and establishing what "good" means in the context of fifteenth-century kingship. Within a six- or eight-lesson sequence, pupils can only scratch the surface. More answerable alternatives might include "How did Henry V win the Battle of Agincourt?" or "Why did Shakespeare present Henry V as an ideal king?"

**Second, the question must be worth answering.** Riley emphasised that pupils should encounter genuine historical puzzles, questions that have exercised historians and that reward the effort of investigation. A question such as "What can we learn about the Romans from examining Pompeii?" is answerable but intellectually thin—it invites description rather than genuine historical thinking. By contrast, "How surprising was the destruction of Pompeii?" requires pupils to establish what Romans knew about volcanic activity, how they interpreted warning signs, and how the eruption challenged or confirmed their understanding of the world.

**Third, the question must be answerable by pupils.** This criterion addresses the accessibility of the enquiry while maintaining rigour. The question should be pitched so that pupils with the requisite prior knowledge and cognitive development can construct meaningful responses. This does not mean simplifying historical complexity—rather, it involves selecting content and designing tasks that enable pupils to engage authentically with disciplinary thinking.

### Refinements and Developments

Building upon Riley's foundation, subsequent work has identified additional characteristics of effective enquiry questions. Christine Counsell has emphasised the importance of questions that generate "productive perplexity"—cognitive dissonance that drives pupils to re-examine their assumptions and construct new understandings. Questions that are too easily answered foreclose thinking; questions that remain perpetually open may leave pupils frustrated and disconnected.

Counsell's "Dodgy Questions Game" has become a staple of history teacher professional development, helping practitioners identify questions that are historically invalid, encourage anachronistic judgement, lack academic rigour, or suffer from sloppy wording. Through analysing and improving "dodgy" questions, teachers develop their capacity to craft enquiries that genuinely advance pupils' historical thinking.

The concept of "residue"—coined by Counsell—also informs enquiry design. A well-crafted enquiry leaves pupils with lasting intellectual gains: new conceptual understanding, improved disciplinary capabilities, or transformed perspectives on the past. When designing enquiries, teachers should ask what residue the sequence will leave behind once specific factual details have faded from memory.

### Types of Enquiry Questions

The history education community has developed typologies of enquiry questions that help teachers diversify their curriculum and ensure coverage of different forms of historical thinking.

**Causal questions** address why events occurred: "Why did the Spanish Armada fail?" "Why did the Industrial Revolution begin in Britain?" These enquiries require pupils to identify and weigh multiple factors, avoiding mono-causal explanations while recognising that some causes exert greater influence than others.

**Change and continuity questions** examine transformation over time: "How far did medicine really change in the Renaissance?" "In what ways did life really change for people in the Industrial Revolution?" Such enquiries challenge pupils to identify what changed, what remained constant, and for whom—recognising that change affects different groups differently.

**Similarity and difference questions** probe patterns and variations: "How similar were the experiences of different groups during the Civil Rights Movement?" "How different were the reigns of Elizabeth I and Mary I?" These enquiries require pupils to establish criteria for comparison and recognise both commonalities and divergences.

**Significance questions** address historical importance: "Why is it so difficult to decide who won the Cold War?" "What should we remember about the Transatlantic Slave Trade?" Significance enquiries invite pupils to consider how historical importance is constructed, contested, and memorialised.

**Interpretations questions** engage with how the past has been represented: "Why do historians disagree about Richard III?" "How has the British Empire been portrayed in films?" These enquiries make explicit the constructed nature of historical accounts and the factors that shape historical interpretation.

**Evidence questions** focus on how we know about the past: "What can we learn from the archaeological remains of the Mary Rose?" "How much can we trust Tudor portraits as evidence?" Such enquiries develop pupils' source analysis capabilities while also raising metacognitive questions about historical method.

## Structuring Enquiry Sequences

### The Anatomy of an Enquiry

A well-designed enquiry sequence typically comprises several interconnected elements. While there is no single template that all enquiries must follow, effective sequences generally include certain key components.

**The hook** introduces the enquiry and captures pupils' interest. This might involve a puzzling source, a provocative statement, or an apparent contradiction that generates curiosity about the question to be investigated. The hook serves both motivational and cognitive purposes, activating prior knowledge and establishing the stakes of the enquiry.

**Building substantive knowledge** occupies much of the enquiry sequence. Pupils need to acquire sufficient knowledge of the period, events, and actors to engage meaningfully with the enquiry question. This knowledge-building phase should not be mere information delivery; it should be structured so that each new piece of information contributes to the emerging answer. Teachers must make explicit how individual lessons connect to the overarching question.

**Encountering disciplinary thinking** occurs as pupils engage with historical sources and interpretations. They learn to evaluate evidence, identify perspective and reliability, and recognise how historians construct arguments. This disciplinary work is not separate from substantive learning but integrated with it—pupils use disciplinary tools to develop their understanding of the past.

**Developing the extended response** typically occurs towards the end of the enquiry. Pupils draw together their accumulated knowledge and understanding to construct answers to the overarching question. This might involve essay writing, presentations, debates, or other forms of extended communication. The format matters less than the requirement to synthesise and evaluate rather than merely recall.

**Reflection and consolidation** concludes the enquiry, helping pupils recognise what they have learned and how their understanding has developed. This metacognitive component reinforces the residue of the enquiry and supports transfer to future learning.

### Pacing and Progression Within Enquiries

Effective enquiry design requires careful attention to pacing. Too rapid a pace leaves pupils with superficial understanding; too slow a pace risks losing momentum and engagement. Christine Counsell's concept of "high challenge, low threat" is relevant here—enquiries should stretch pupils intellectually while providing sufficient scaffolding to make success achievable.

The structure of individual lessons within an enquiry matters. While the overall sequence moves towards answering the overarching question, each lesson should have its own clear purpose and contribute visibly to the developing argument. Lesson objectives should be expressed in terms of historical understanding rather than activity completion: "To understand why William's victory at Hastings was not inevitable" rather than "To make a poster about the Battle of Hastings."

### The Role of Sub-Questions

Many teachers find it helpful to break overarching enquiry questions into sub-questions that structure individual lessons or lesson sequences. For example, an enquiry on "How far did the Normans change England?" might include sub-questions such as:

- What was England like before 1066?
- How did the Normans seize control of England?
- In what ways did Norman rule affect who held power?
- How did the Normans change everyday life for ordinary people?
- How far do historians agree about Norman impact?

These sub-questions should not fragment the enquiry into disconnected episodes. Rather, they should represent steps towards answering the overarching question, with explicit attention to how each sub-question contributes to the whole.

## Progression in Enquiry Design Across Key Stages

### Key Stage 1

At Key Stage 1, enquiry questions should be concrete, accessible, and closely tied to pupils' developing understanding of time and change. Questions such as "How have toys changed since our grandparents were young?" or "Why do we remember Florence Nightingale?" enable pupils to engage with historical thinking appropriate to their developmental stage.

Enquiries at this stage typically span shorter time periods and focus on topics connected to pupils' immediate experience or imagination. The emphasis is on developing chronological awareness and understanding that the past was different from the present, rather than on sophisticated causal or interpretative thinking.

### Key Stage 2

Key Stage 2 enquiries can address longer time periods and more abstract concepts, though they should remain anchored in specific contexts. The National Curriculum requirements for this key stage include developing "a chronologically secure knowledge and understanding of British, local and world history" and noting "connections, contrasts and trends over time."

Enquiry questions at Key Stage 2 might include: "How did the lives of rich and poor people differ in Victorian Britain?" "Why did the Ancient Egyptians build pyramids?" or "What was the impact of the Roman invasion on Britain?" These questions require pupils to handle multiple pieces of information, recognise patterns, and begin constructing arguments supported by evidence.

The Key Stage 2 History curriculum explicitly identifies disciplinary concepts that should inform enquiry design: continuity and change, cause and consequence, similarity and difference, and historical significance. Enquiries should be designed to develop pupils' understanding of these concepts through specific historical contexts.

### Key Stage 3

Key Stage 3 represents a significant expansion in the sophistication of enquiry design. Pupils can now handle more complex causal questions, engage with historical interpretations more explicitly, and work with larger quantities of source material. The National Curriculum emphasises that pupils should "understand historical concepts such as continuity and change, cause and consequence, similarity, difference and significance, and use them to make connections, draw contrasts, analyse trends, frame historically-valid questions and create their own structured accounts."

Enquiry questions at Key Stage 3 might include: "Why did the Industrial Revolution happen in Britain rather than elsewhere?" "How and why have interpretations of the British Empire changed over time?" or "Was the twentieth century the most violent in human history?" These questions require pupils to engage with substantive knowledge at greater depth, handle multiple interpretations, and construct more sophisticated arguments.

Ofsted's subject report on history (2023) noted that in many schools, Key Stage 3 curricula are thoughtfully constructed around enquiry questions that build chronological and conceptual understanding. However, the report also identified schools where the enquiry structure had become formulaic, with questions that failed to generate genuine historical thinking.

### GCSE and A-Level

At GCSE and A-Level, enquiry design must accommodate the requirements of examination specifications while maintaining intellectual integrity. The shift to 9-1 GCSE specifications has prompted renewed attention to how enquiry-based approaches can support success in terminal examinations while also developing genuine historical understanding.

Many teachers have found that the skills developed through enquiry-based learning—handling evidence, constructing arguments, evaluating interpretations—transfer directly to the demands of GCSE assessment. However, examination preparation also requires explicit attention to the specific assessment formats and mark schemes that pupils will encounter.

At A-Level, the Historical Investigation (NEA) represents an extended enquiry that pupils design and conduct independently. This requirement has influenced approaches to enquiry throughout Key Stage 5, with teachers seeking to develop the research and analytical capabilities that pupils will need for independent investigation.

## Common Pitfalls in Enquiry Design

### Questions That Are Too Broad

One of the most common errors in enquiry design is selecting questions that are too broad to be meaningfully addressed within available time. "What was life like in Victorian Britain?" or "Why did the Second World War happen?" are legitimate historical questions, but they encompass such vast territories that any school-level enquiry can only skim the surface. Better to focus sharply: "How did working conditions in factories change between 1800 and 1850?" or "How did the invasion of Poland escalate into a world war?"

### Questions That Are Too Narrow

Conversely, some enquiries are so narrowly focused that they fail to develop significant historical understanding. An enquiry confined to "What happened on the first day of the Battle of the Somme?" might yield detailed factual knowledge but limited conceptual development. Better questions would connect specific events to broader historical issues: "Why was the first day of the Somme so costly, and what does this reveal about the nature of trench warfare?"

### Questions That Are Historically Thin

Some enquiry questions, while answerable, do not engage pupils with genuine historical thinking. "What can we learn about the Romans from this source?" invites description rather than analysis. "How reliable is this source about Roman Britain?" requires more sophisticated historical thinking about evidence and interpretation.

### Disconnecting Enquiry from Curriculum Coherence

Individual enquiries should not exist in isolation. They need to be designed with attention to what pupils have learned previously and what they will learn subsequently. An enquiry about the Industrial Revolution builds upon earlier enquiries about pre-industrial society and prepares pupils for subsequent study of twentieth-century economic and social change. Curriculum leaders need to plan enquiries in sequence, ensuring that knowledge and concepts accumulate systematically.

### Over-Prescribing the Answer

Enquiry questions that lead inexorably to a single predetermined answer fail to engage pupils in genuine historical thinking. While teachers should have clear learning objectives, these should focus on the thinking processes pupils will develop rather than the specific conclusion they should reach. The best enquiries leave room for pupils to construct their own reasoned responses, supported by evidence.

## Practical Strategies for Enquiry Design

### Starting with Historical Content

Effective enquiry design begins with the historical content teachers want pupils to learn. Rather than starting with a catchy question and then searching for content to fit it, teachers should first identify the substantive knowledge and disciplinary understanding they wish to develop, then craft a question that will structure effective learning of that content.

This approach ensures that enquiries are grounded in historical substance rather than pedagogical gimmickry. The question serves the content; the content does not serve the question.

### Drawing on Historical Scholarship

Teachers designing enquiries should engage with historical scholarship on their chosen topics. Understanding how historians have debated and interpreted events enables teachers to craft questions that reflect genuine disciplinary concerns. Reading academic articles, monographs, and historiographical surveys provides the depth of understanding necessary for effective enquiry design.

Professional organisations such as the Historical Association provide valuable support here, offering resources that connect school history with current historical scholarship.

### Collaborating with Colleagues

Enquiry design benefits from collaborative working. Colleagues can critique draft questions, suggest alternative approaches, and share successful enquiries they have used. The "One Big History Department" blog and similar platforms enable teachers
