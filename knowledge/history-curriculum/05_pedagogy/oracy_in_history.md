# Oracy in History

Oracy—the ability to articulate ideas, develop understanding and engage with others through spoken language—is fundamental to the discipline of history. History classrooms are inherently discursive spaces where pupils learn to construct arguments, evaluate evidence, and engage with multiple perspectives through talk. As the Historical Association notes, oracy is not merely an additional skill to be taught alongside historical content but is integral to how pupils think historically and develop disciplinary understanding.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Dialogic Teaching and Alexander's Principles

Robin Alexander's extensive research on dialogic teaching provides the foundational framework for understanding quality classroom talk in history. Alexander (2008) defines dialogic teaching as teaching that achieves common understanding through structured, cumulative questioning and discussion that guide and prompt, reduce choices, minimise risk and error, and expedite the 'handover' of concepts and principles. His five principles of dialogic teaching—collective, reciprocal, supportive, cumulative and purposeful—have particular resonance for history pedagogy.

The principle of **cumulativeness** is especially significant for historical learning. History is a cumulative discipline where understanding develops through layering evidence, perspectives and interpretations. Classroom talk that builds coherently on previous contributions—what Alexander terms 'chaining'—mirrors how historical understanding develops. Teachers who employ cumulative talk help pupils see connections between ideas, evidence and arguments, supporting the development of sophisticated historical thinking.

Mercer and Littleton's (2007) work on **exploratory talk** complements Alexander's framework. Exploratory talk, characterised by critical but constructive engagement with others' ideas, is particularly suited to history where pupils must evaluate conflicting accounts and interpretations. The ground rules of exploratory talk—statements are offered for joint consideration, challenges are acceptable, justifications are expected, and alternatives are sought—directly support the disciplinary norms of historical enquiry.

### Voice 21 and the Oracy Framework

Voice 21, working with Oracy Cambridge at the University of Cambridge, has developed a comprehensive framework for oracy education that is increasingly influential in history departments. Their framework identifies four strands of oracy: physical (voice and body language), linguistic (vocabulary and rhetoric), cognitive (content and structure) and social and emotional (listening and collaboration). Each strand has specific relevance for historical discourse.

The **cognitive strand** encompasses the skills most directly associated with historical thinking: content knowledge, structure and organisation of arguments, and reasoning. The Voice 21 framework emphasises that these cognitive skills cannot be developed in isolation but require the physical, linguistic and social foundations to be in place. This has implications for history teachers who may focus primarily on the cognitive aspects of pupil contributions while neglecting the physical and social dimensions that enable effective historical discussion.

### The EEF and Oral Language Interventions

The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) identifies oral language interventions as having significant positive impact on pupil attainment, with an average effect size of +5 months' progress. Their guidance emphasises that oral language development is not merely about providing opportunities for talk but about structuring that talk to develop specific skills. The EEF's Improving Literacy in Secondary Schools guidance (2021) includes specific recommendations for developing high-quality classroom talk, noting that structured discussion approaches are particularly effective for developing understanding of complex texts and ideas.

For history specifically, the EEF recommends that departments identify the specific oracy skills pupils need to develop and provide targeted instruction in these skills. This might include teaching pupils how to structure historical arguments, how to use evidence to support claims, or how to engage respectfully with perspectives that differ from their own.

## Types of Oracy in History

### Exploratory Talk

Exploratory talk serves a crucial function in history classrooms, providing space for pupils to work through ideas, test hypotheses and develop understanding before committing to a position. Culkin-Smith and colleagues emphasise that exploratory talk should be explicitly taught and scaffolded, with pupils understanding that this form of talk has different purposes and ground rules from presentational talk.

In history, exploratory talk might involve:

- **Initial sense-making**: Pupils discussing an unfamiliar source or image to generate questions and initial interpretations before receiving teacher input or context
- **Hypothesis generation**: Small groups developing possible explanations for historical phenomena, with the understanding that all ideas will be evaluated against evidence
- **Interpretation exploration**: Pupils testing different historical interpretations against the available evidence, considering strengths and limitations of each
- **Vocabulary development**: Structured discussion of historical terminology, with pupils using new vocabulary in context before encountering it in reading or writing

The Historical Association's guidance stresses that exploratory talk requires careful teacher facilitation. Teachers must create conditions where pupils feel safe to offer tentative ideas that may be incorrect, while also ensuring that talk remains focused on historical questions and evidence rather than becoming an exchange of unsupported opinion.

### Presentational Talk

Presentational talk in history encompasses the various ways pupils communicate historical understanding to audiences. This includes formal presentations, contributions to class discussion, structured debates and the presentation of research findings. Presentational talk serves both summative and formative purposes: it allows pupils to demonstrate learning while also consolidating understanding through the act of articulation.

Voice 21's **'Ignite' talks** have been adopted by some history departments as a format for developing presentational oracy. These are fast-paced, three-minute talks delivered without notes following brief preparation time. For history, this format develops pupils' ability to distil key points, structure arguments concisely and speak with authority about historical topics. The time constraint forces pupils to prioritise information and identify the most significant points, which itself supports historical thinking about significance and causal weighting.

More formal historical presentations, such as those modelled on academic conference papers, develop different skills. These require pupils to synthesise multiple sources, structure extended arguments and respond to audience questions. Such presentations mirror the disciplinary practices of historians and help pupils understand history as an active, contested field rather than a fixed body of knowledge.

### Dialogic Classrooms

The most sophisticated oracy environments in history are **dialogic classrooms** where talk is the primary medium through which historical understanding is constructed. In such classrooms, the teacher facilitates sustained dialogue about historical questions, with pupils building on each other's contributions and the teacher's strategic input to develop collective understanding.

Features of dialogic history classrooms include:

- **Authentic historical questions** that are genuinely open and do not have predetermined answers
- **Cumulative discussion** where contributions build on and develop previous points
- **Teacher facilitation** that guides discussion while allowing pupil ownership of ideas
- **Use of evidence** as the touchstone for evaluating contributions
- **Multiple perspectives** that are entertained and evaluated before conclusions are drawn

Research by Lefstein and Snell (2014) distinguishes between dialogically organised instruction—which structures opportunities for dialogue—and dialogic pedagogy—which embodies dialogic values throughout teaching. History teachers might begin with the former while working towards the latter as both their own and their pupils' dialogic skills develop.

## Classroom Strategies for Historical Oracy

### Structured Academic Controversy

Structured Academic Controversy (SAC), developed by the US-based Teaching History organisation, provides a framework for managing the discussion of genuinely controversial historical questions. Unlike traditional debates where participants are assigned positions they may not personally hold and the goal is to win, SAC requires participants to work towards consensus through understanding multiple perspectives.

The SAC process involves four stages:

1. **Position presentation**: Pairs present the strongest case for their assigned position, drawing on evidence
2. **Position defence**: Pairs defend their position against challenges from the opposing pair, while remaining respectful and evidence-focused
3. **Position reversal**: Pairs present the opposing position, demonstrating accurate understanding
4. **Consensus seeking**: All participants work together to develop a consensus position that synthesises the strongest elements from both perspectives

This structure develops multiple oracy skills: constructing arguments, presenting with clarity, listening for understanding, questioning respectfully and synthesising perspectives. For history specifically, it supports understanding of historical interpretation and the contested nature of historical knowledge.

### Socratic Seminar

The Socratic seminar, adapted for history classrooms, uses a text (often a primary source or historical interpretation) as the foundation for discussion. Unlike teacher-led questioning, seminars place responsibility for discussion on pupils, who generate questions, respond to each other and develop lines of enquiry collectively.

Effective Socratic seminars in history require:

- **Careful text selection**: Sources that are rich enough to support multiple interpretations but accessible enough for pupils to engage with independently
- **Pre-seminar preparation**: Time for pupils to read, annotate and generate questions before discussion begins
- **Clear norms**: Established protocols for participation, turn-taking and building on others' contributions
- **Teacher as facilitator**: The teacher participates minimally, prompting only to deepen thinking or redirect if discussion moves away from the text
- **Post-seminar reflection**: Opportunities for pupils to evaluate their participation and consolidate learning through writing

Facing History and Ourselves emphasises that Socratic seminars develop both oracy and historical thinking simultaneously. Pupils learn to ground arguments in evidence, to consider multiple interpretations and to modify their thinking in response to new perspectives—all through the medium of structured talk.

### The Harkness Method

The Harkness method, originating at Phillips Exeter Academy and increasingly adopted in UK schools, places pupils around an oval table (literal or metaphorical) with the teacher as a participant rather than leader. Discussion is entirely pupil-directed, with responsibility for sustaining conversation, deepening analysis and ensuring inclusive participation resting with the group.

In history classrooms, Harkness discussions work best with provocative stimulus material—a controversial interpretation, a collection of contradictory sources or an open-ended enquiry question. The teacher may provide scaffolding through 'talking roles' that pupils adopt (e.g., questioner, evidence-checker, devil's advocate, synthesiser) or through discussion protocols that structure turn-taking.

Oracy Cambridge notes that the Harkness method requires significant investment in building pupils' discussion skills before it can be implemented effectively. Pupils need explicit instruction in how to ask generative questions, how to build on others' contributions and how to manage disagreement constructively.

### Think-Pair-Share and Variations

Think-Pair-Share and its variations provide structured opportunities for oracy that scaffold towards whole-class discussion. The basic structure—individual thinking time, paired discussion, sharing with the larger group—ensures that all pupils engage with ideas before any are shared publicly.

Variations particularly suited to history include:

- **Think-Pair-Square-Share**: Adding a four-person discussion stage before whole-class sharing, allowing for more development of ideas
- **Pair-Share-Compare**: Pairs share their thinking, then compare their conclusions with another pair, developing evaluation skills
- **Concentric Circles**: Inner and outer circles discuss different aspects of a question, then exchange places and perspectives
- **Whip-Round**: Rapid sharing of one idea from each pupil, ensuring all voices are heard before deeper exploration

The Chartered College of Teaching research on paired discussion in history found that the quality of paired talk significantly influences the quality of whole-class discussion that follows. When pairs engaged in genuinely exploratory talk, testing ideas and challenging each other, subsequent whole-class discussion was more sophisticated. This suggests that teachers should monitor and intervene in paired discussions, not merely use them as time-filling activities.

## Questioning and Teacher Talk

### Types of Questions in History

Teacher questioning is the primary tool for orchestrating oracy in history classrooms. Different question types serve different purposes in developing historical thinking:

**Clarification questions** ('What do you mean by...?', 'Can you give an example?') help pupils articulate their thinking more precisely and ensure shared understanding. These are particularly important when pupils use historical terminology imprecisely or make claims that need unpacking.

**Evidence questions** ('What makes you say that?', 'Which source supports your view?') direct pupils back to historical evidence and discourage unsupported assertion. These questions model the evidentiary basis of historical knowledge and help pupils develop the habit of grounding claims in sources.

**Elaboration questions** ('Can you say more about...?', 'What else might explain...?') extend thinking and develop more nuanced understanding. In history, these questions often help pupils recognise complexity—multiple causes, varied perspectives or competing interpretations.

**Connection questions** ('How does this relate to...?', 'Is this similar to what we saw earlier?') support the cumulative building of understanding that Alexander identifies as central to dialogic teaching. These questions help pupils see patterns across time and make links between topics.

**Perspective questions** ('How might someone at the time have seen this differently?', 'Why might a historian disagree?') develop pupils' understanding of historical interpretation and the role of perspective in shaping accounts of the past.

### The 'Why' Technique

The University of Nottingham's 'Move Me On' materials popularised the technique of following pupil responses with 'Why?' as a simple but powerful tool for deepening historical thinking. Rather than accepting surface-level responses, teachers use 'Why?' to probe underlying reasoning, challenge assumptions and develop more sophisticated arguments.

This technique is particularly valuable in history because it mirrors the disciplinary practice of questioning received narratives and seeking deeper explanations. When pupils offer a causal explanation, asking 'Why?' might reveal whether they understand the mechanism of causation or are merely repeating a textbook formula. When pupils make claims about historical significance, 'Why?' probes the criteria they are applying and whether these criteria are appropriate and consistently applied.

### Wait Time and Pacing

Research on classroom talk consistently demonstrates the importance of **wait time**—the pause between teacher question and pupil response, and between pupil response and teacher follow-up. Extended wait time (three seconds or more) produces longer, more complex responses and increases the number of pupils who participate.

In history, wait time is particularly important because historical questions often require pupils to marshal evidence, consider multiple perspectives and formulate arguments. Rushing this process produces superficial responses that do not reflect genuine historical thinking. The Historical Association recommends that history teachers consciously extend wait time, particularly when asking higher-order questions about cause, consequence, change, significance or interpretation.

Wait time after pupil responses—what some researchers call 'wait time two'—is equally important. When teachers pause before responding to pupil contributions, they signal that the contribution is being taken seriously and create space for other pupils to respond. This can transform the I-R-E (Initiation-Response-Evaluation) pattern that dominates many classrooms into more genuinely dialogic interaction.

## Progression in Historical Oracy

### Key Stage 1 and 2

At primary level, oracy in history focuses on developing foundational skills that will support later disciplinary learning. Pupils learn to:

- **Articulate questions** about the past, expressing curiosity and identifying what they would like to find out
- **Narrate and explain** simple sequences of events, using temporal language appropriately
- **Compare** past and present, identifying similarities and differences
- **Listen** to historical narratives and respond to questions about them
- **Discuss** sources and artefacts, offering interpretations based on observation

Voice 21's primary materials emphasise the importance of explicitly teaching the language of comparison and change—words like 'before', 'after', 'while', 'because', 'so'—that enable pupils to construct historical narratives and explanations. The Cambridge Primary Review found that pupils who developed rich historical vocabulary through talk were better able to engage with written historical texts.

### Key Stage 3

At Key Stage 3, oracy in history becomes more explicitly disciplinary. Pupils engage with second-order concepts (cause, consequence, change, continuity, similarity, difference, significance) through talk, learning to use these concepts as tools for historical analysis. Discussion increasingly focuses on:

- **Evaluating evidence**: Assessing the reliability and utility of sources
- **Understanding interpretation**: Recognising that historians reach different conclusions from the same evidence
- **Constructing arguments**: Using evidence to support claims about the past
- **Engaging with controversy**: Discussing questions that have no single 'right' answer

The transition to disciplinary oracy requires explicit instruction. Pupils need to learn the conventions of historical discourse: how to cite evidence, how to acknowledge uncertainty, how to engage with alternative interpretations. The Historical Association's Teaching History journal provides numerous examples of how teachers have developed pupils' disciplinary oracy at this stage.

### GCSE and A-Level

At examination level, oracy continues to support historical learning even though it is not directly assessed. Discussion remains important for:

- **Developing sophisticated arguments**: Talking through complex causal or interpretive questions before writing
- **Evaluating interpretations**: Engaging with historians' arguments and developing independent assessments
- **Synthesising evidence**: Drawing together multiple sources to support arguments
- **Preparing for assessment**: Discussing exemplar responses and criteria for success

For the A-Level History NEA (Non-Examined Assessment), oracy is particularly valuable in the early stages. Talking through potential questions, discussing source selection and articulating emerging arguments helps pupils develop their thinking before committing to written drafts. Some teachers use paired or small-group 'defences' of draft NEA proposals, where pupils explain and justify their approach to peers.

## Assessment of Oracy in History

### Formative Assessment

Formative assessment of oracy in history focuses on identifying what pupils can do and what they need to develop next. Effective formative assessment of oracy requires:

- **Clear success criteria**: Pupils should understand what quality historical talk looks like and sounds like
- **Structured observation**: Teachers need systematic approaches for monitoring oracy during lessons
- **Targeted feedback**: Specific, actionable feedback on how pupils can improve their contributions
- **Peer and self-assessment**: Pupils learning to evaluate their own and others' historical talk

The Voice 21 framework provides a structure for formative assessment, with its four strands offering specific dimensions to assess. In history, the cognitive strand—content, structure and reasoning—might be prioritised, but assessment should also attend to the physical, linguistic and social dimensions that enable effective participation.

### Summative Assessment

While oracy is not formally assessed in most history qualifications, some departments choose to assess oracy summatively for reporting or certification purposes. Approaches include:

- **Recorded discussions**: Audio or video recording of structured discussions for assessment
- **Presentations**: Formal presentations on historical topics with associated assessment criteria
- **Portfolio approaches**: Collections of evidence demonstrating oracy development over time
- **Moderated assessments**: Standardised discussion tasks assessed against agreed criteria

The Oracy Cambridge approach to assessment emphasises that summative assessment should capture the full range of oracy skills, not merely presentational talk. This requires assessment approaches that include collaborative discussion and listening as well as individual presentation.

### Feedback on Oracy

Feedback on oracy presents particular challenges because talk is ephemeral. Effective approaches to oracy feedback in history include:

- **Immediate verbal feedback**: Brief, specific comments during or immediately after contributions
- **Recorded playback**: Audio or video recording of discussions for
subsequent review with pupils
- **Written reflections**: Pupils writing about their oracy following discussion activities
- **Peer observation**: Structured peer observation using agreed criteria

The Chartered College research found that feedback on oracy was most effective when it focused on specific, actionable improvements rather than general praise or criticism. For example, rather than saying 'good point', feedback might specify how the contribution demonstrated historical thinking: 'You supported that claim with specific evidence from Source B, which strengthened your argument.'

## Challenges and Solutions

### Managing Dominant Voices

A common challenge in historical discussion is managing pupils who dominate while ensuring all voices are heard. Strategies that have proven effective include:

- **Talking tokens**: Pupils spend a token to contribute; when tokens are gone, they must listen
- **Discussion maps**: Visual tracking of who has contributed to ensure inclusive participation
- **Structured turns**: Protocols like 'three before me' requiring three other pupils to speak before anyone speaks again
- **Small-group preparation**: Time in small groups for all pupils to formulate contributions before whole-class discussion

### Addressing Misconceptions Through Talk

Oracy provides opportunities to surface and address historical misconceptions. When pupils articulate their thinking, misconceptions become visible and can be addressed. However, this requires careful handling—pupils need to feel safe to express ideas that may be incorrect, and teachers need strategies for challenging misconceptions without undermining confidence.

The Historical Association recommends 're-voicing' as a technique: the teacher restates a pupil's contribution in more historically accurate terms while preserving the underlying insight. This validates the pupil's thinking while modelling more precise historical discourse.

### Building Oracy Across the Curriculum

While history offers rich opportunities for oracy, pupils develop oracy most effectively when approaches are consistent across subjects. History departments can contribute to whole-school oracy development by:

- Sharing successful strategies with colleagues in other departments
- Participating in cross-curricular oracy initiatives
- Ensuring that the language and approaches used in history align with whole-school oracy frameworks
- Contributing to the documentation of oracy progression across the school

Oracy Cambridge's research suggests that pupils transfer oracy skills most effectively when they are explicitly taught as transferable skills rather than subject-specific competencies. History teachers might explicitly draw pupils' attention to how discussion skills developed in history can be applied in other contexts.

## Conclusion

Oracy is not an optional extra in history education but a fundamental dimension of how pupils learn to think historically. From Alexander's dialogic teaching to Voice 21's comprehensive framework, the research consistently demonstrates that structured, purposeful talk develops both disciplinary understanding and broader communication skills. The classroom strategies outlined in this article—from Structured Academic Controversy to the Harkness Method—provide practical approaches for embedding high-quality oracy in history classrooms at all key stages.

The challenge for history teachers is not whether to prioritise oracy but how to do so effectively. This requires attention to the physical, linguistic, cognitive and social dimensions of talk; careful planning of discussion activities; systematic development of oracy skills across key stages; and consistent approaches to assessment and feedback. When these elements are in place, oracy becomes the medium through which pupils construct historical understanding, developing not only their knowledge of the past but their capacity to engage critically with the present.
