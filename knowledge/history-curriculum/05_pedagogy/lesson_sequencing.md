# Lesson Sequencing in History

## Introduction

Lesson sequencing in history education represents one of the most critical yet challenging aspects of curriculum design. Unlike subjects where knowledge accumulates in a strictly linear fashion, history demands careful orchestration of both substantive content and disciplinary concepts across time, space, and theme. The Ofsted Research Review Series: History (2021) emphasises that "opportunities for pupils to 'do' history must be carefully planned and sequenced to ensure that pupils have appropriately secure knowledge." This principle underpins effective history pedagogy at all key stages.

Effective lesson sequencing extends far beyond simply arranging topics in chronological order. It requires thoughtful consideration of how pupils build historical knowledge, develop disciplinary understanding, and construct increasingly sophisticated arguments over time. Teachers must balance the demands of breadth and depth, overview and depth studies, and the simultaneous development of substantive and disciplinary knowledge.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Progression Models in History

Christine Counsell's work on progression models has fundamentally shaped contemporary understanding of how pupils develop as historians. Her research demonstrates that progression in history is not merely about accumulating more facts, but about developing increasingly sophisticated ways of thinking about the past. This has profound implications for lesson sequencing, as teachers must plan sequences that enable pupils to encounter historical concepts at increasing levels of complexity.

The Ofsted research review identifies that "progress in curricular terms means knowing more and remembering more," but crucially adds that this must be understood within a disciplinary framework. Pupils must know more about how historians construct knowledge, not simply more historical information. This dual aspect of progression—substantive and disciplinary—must be woven throughout lesson sequences.

### Cognitive Load and Sequencing

Cognitive science research informs sequencing decisions by highlighting the importance of managing intrinsic, extraneous, and germane cognitive load. In history lessons, intrinsic load is high because pupils must simultaneously grasp new content while applying disciplinary concepts. Effective sequencing reduces this burden by ensuring that pupils encounter disciplinary frameworks in familiar contexts before applying them to new material.

The Historical Association's guidance on planning for progression identifies four lenses through which sequencing decisions should be viewed:

1. **Chronological understanding**: How pupils develop sense of period and chronological frameworks
2. **Substantive knowledge**: The accumulation of historical content across topics
3. **Disciplinary knowledge**: Understanding of how historical knowledge is constructed
4. **Conceptual development**: The progressive sophistication of historical thinking

Each lesson sequence should contribute to development across all four lenses, with careful attention to where emphasis falls at different stages.

## Principles of Effective Sequencing

### Principle 1: The Interplay of Overview and Depth

The National Curriculum for History requires pupils to study both broad sweeps of history (overviews) and focused investigations (depth studies). Effective sequencing balances these approaches, using each to reinforce the other. Dale Banham's influential work on "using depth to strengthen overview" demonstrates how carefully chosen depth studies can illuminate broader patterns of change and continuity.

A well-sequenced curriculum might interleave overview and depth units:
- **Overview units** establish chronological frameworks and broad patterns
- **Depth units** provide intensive engagement with specific periods or events
- **Return to overview** with enhanced understanding from depth knowledge
- **Thematic units** draw connections across time periods previously studied

This rhythmic alternation prevents the common problem of pupils acquiring disconnected "islands" of historical knowledge.

### Principle 2: Building Disciplinary Knowledge Explicitly

Disciplinary concepts—cause and consequence, change and continuity, similarity and difference, significance, and historical interpretation—cannot be assumed to develop naturally. Each requires explicit teaching within carefully sequenced lesson sequences.

The Ofsted review notes that "in the earlier stages of pupils' education, teachers may focus on teaching them about aspects of disciplinary knowledge in order to prepare them to construct their own arguments and accounts in future." This suggests a sequencing strategy where:

- **Early lessons** introduce disciplinary concepts in scaffolded, accessible forms
- **Middle lessons** provide guided practice with increasing independence
- **Later lessons** demand independent application to new contexts

For example, a sequence on causation might begin with identifying simple causes, progress to categorising causes by type, move to evaluating relative importance, and culminate in constructing multi-causal explanations.

### Principle 3: Interleaving and Spaced Practice

Cognitive research supports interleaving different topics and returning to material after intervals rather than teaching in discrete blocks. In history, this might mean:

- Regular revisit of prior periods to strengthen chronological frameworks
- Interleaving different disciplinary concepts rather than teaching them separately
- Connecting new topics explicitly to previously studied content

The Historical Association recommends that departments maintain a "long view" of sequencing that extends beyond individual units to ensure these connections are planned rather than incidental.

### Principle 4: The Narrative Dimension

History is fundamentally a narrative discipline, and effective sequencing honours this. However, narrative sequencing must be distinguished from simple chronology. A narrative sequence:

- Builds coherent stories that make sense of complex events
- Develops characters (individuals, groups, nations) across time
- Establishes causal chains that explain how situations develop
- Creates suspense and curiosity that motivate pupil engagement

Teachers must balance the narrative imperative against the need to develop analytical distance and disciplinary understanding.

## Sequencing at Different Key Stages

### Key Stage 1

At Key Stage 1, sequencing focuses on developing fundamental historical awareness:

- **Personal and family history** provides accessible entry points
- **Famous people and events** establish initial chronological frameworks
- **Changes within living memory** connect history to pupils' experience
- **Significant events beyond living memory** extend chronological range

Lesson sequences should be short, concrete, and heavily supported by visual and material sources. The sequencing priority is establishing that the past was different and developing basic chronological vocabulary.

### Key Stage 2

Key Stage 2 sequencing builds systematic chronological understanding:

- **British history chronological framework**: Stone Age to Iron Age → Romans → Anglo-Saxons → Vikings → Norman Conquest → Medieval → Tudors → Stuarts → Victorian → Beyond 1066 (local study)
- **World history**: Ancient civilisations (Egypt, Greece, Maya, etc.)
- **Thematic studies**: Changes in an aspect of social history

The sequencing challenge is helping pupils hold this expanded chronological framework in mind. Many successful schemes interleave British and world history to reinforce chronological understanding through comparison and contrast.

Disciplinary concepts are introduced more explicitly at Key Stage 2, with lesson sequences designed to develop understanding of evidence, cause and consequence, and change and continuity.

### Key Stage 3

Key Stage 3 represents the most intensive period of history education, with sequencing decisions having lasting impact on pupils' historical understanding:

- **Medieval realms**: 1066-1500, establishing foundational concepts
- **Early modern**: 1500-1750, developing complexity of analysis
- **Industrial and modern**: 1750-present, culminating in 20th-century studies

Effective Key Stage 3 sequencing ensures that:
- Prior learning from Key Stage 2 is activated and built upon
- Disciplinary concepts are revisited with increasing sophistication
- The curriculum extends beyond Britain to include significant world history
- Local history is integrated meaningfully

Christine Counsell's "Changing Histories" curriculum exemplifies coherent Key Stage 3 sequencing, embodying "the requirements for scope, coherence, rigour and sequencing" through carefully constructed enquiry questions that drive each unit.

### Key Stage 4 and Beyond

GCSE and A-Level sequencing operates within examination board specifications but retains significant teacher agency in how content is ordered within units:

- **Thematic studies** require careful sequencing to show development over time
- **Period studies** demand coherent narrative with embedded analysis
- **Breadth studies** need strategic selection and ordering of content

At this level, sequencing must explicitly prepare pupils for assessment while maintaining disciplinary integrity. This includes sequencing essay skills, source analysis approaches, and historical interpretations alongside content coverage.

## The Enquiry Question as Sequencing Device

The enquiry question has become the dominant framework for sequencing history lessons, particularly at Key Stage 3. A well-constructed enquiry:

- Provides coherence across a sequence of lessons
- Creates genuine intellectual puzzle that motivates engagement
- Requires deployment of substantive and disciplinary knowledge
- Culminates in meaningful historical argument

The structure of an enquiry sequence typically follows this pattern:

1. **Launch lesson**: Establish the enquiry question and initial engagement
2. **Investigation lessons**: Build knowledge through source work and teacher input
3. **Analysis lessons**: Apply disciplinary concepts to develop understanding
4. **Synthesis lesson**: Draw together learning to address the enquiry question
5. **Reflection lesson**: Consolidate and connect to broader curriculum

Each lesson in the sequence must earn its place by contributing to the overarching enquiry. This prevents the common problem of lessons that, while individually sound, do not cohere into meaningful progression.

## Common Sequencing Challenges

### The Coverage Conundrum

History curricula always contain more content than can be taught in depth. Sequencing decisions inevitably involve selection, and teachers must be clear about their rationale for what is included, what is omitted, and what is touched upon lightly.

The Ofsted review warns against "skimming" approaches where pupils encounter many topics superficially. Effective sequencing requires difficult decisions about depth of coverage, with some topics studied intensively while others provide chronological signposts.

### The Disciplinary-Substantive Balance

Every lesson sequence must balance content coverage with disciplinary development. An overemphasis on substantive knowledge produces pupils who know facts but cannot think historically. An overemphasis on disciplinary concepts produces pupils who can discuss "how we know about the past" without knowing much about it.

Effective sequencing integrates these dimensions, using substantive content as the medium through which disciplinary understanding develops.

### Managing Complexity

History is inherently complex, and sequencing must manage how pupils encounter this complexity. Strategies include:

- **Simplification without distortion**: Presenting accessible versions of complex ideas that remain faithful to historical scholarship
- **Progressive revelation**: Unfolding complexity gradually across a sequence
- **Multiple perspectives**: Sequencing encounters with different viewpoints deliberately
- **Return and revisit**: Using spaced practice to deepen understanding over time

### Assessment Integration

Sequencing must incorporate meaningful assessment that informs teaching. This includes:

- **Diagnostic assessment** at the start of sequences to identify prior knowledge
- **Formative assessment** throughout to check understanding and adjust teaching
- **Summative assessment** that captures learning at sequence end

Assessment sequences should mirror lesson sequences, testing the same knowledge and understanding that teaching prioritises.

## Practical Sequencing Strategies

### The Story, Source, Scholarship Model

One effective sequencing approach structures units around three phases:

1. **Story**: Establish the narrative foundation—what happened, when, involving whom
2. **Source**: Investigate how we know—critical engagement with evidence
3. **Scholarship**: Explore interpretation—how historians have understood these events

This sequence ensures pupils have secure substantive knowledge before tackling disciplinary complexity.

### The Hook, Line, Sinker Structure

For individual enquiries, this structure provides clear sequencing:

- **Hook**: Engaging opening that raises the enquiry question
- **Line**: Sustained investigation building knowledge and understanding
- **Sinker**: Culminating activity that requires pupils to synthesise learning

### The Micro-to-Macro Progression

Some topics benefit from sequencing that moves from specific instances to general patterns:

1. **Specific case study** establishing concrete understanding
2. **Comparison with other cases** developing pattern recognition
3. **Generalisation and abstraction** identifying broader themes
4. **Application to new cases** testing developed understanding

This mirrors how historical understanding often develops, from particular knowledge to more general conceptual grasp.

## Monitoring and Evaluating Sequencing

Effective sequencing requires ongoing evaluation. Department leaders should regularly review:

- **Pupil work across sequences**: Does quality improve as expected?
- **Assessment outcomes**: Are pupils securing intended learning?
- **Pupil voice**: Can pupils articulate what they have learned and how it connects?
- **Transition data**: Are pupils prepared for next stage requirements?

Ofsted deep dives in history typically examine sequencing closely, expecting subject leaders to articulate clear rationale for curriculum ordering and demonstrate how this translates into classroom practice.

## Conclusion

Lesson sequencing in history is both an art and a science. It requires deep subject knowledge to identify what must be taught in what order, combined with pedagogical skill to transform this into engaging, effective lessons. The best sequenced curricula balance coherence with interest, rigour with accessibility, and disciplinary integrity with pupil engagement.

As the Historical Association guidance emphasises, there is no single correct sequence—decisions must reflect school context, pupil needs, and departmental expertise. What matters is that sequencing is deliberate, principled, and subject to ongoing evaluation and refinement. Teachers who invest thought in sequencing decisions reap rewards in pupil learning that is deeper, more secure, and more transferable.

The ultimate test of sequencing is whether pupils develop as increasingly capable historians—able to construct arguments, evaluate evidence, understand change and continuity, and engage with the past in ways that are both knowledgeable and critically aware. Achieving this requires lesson sequences that are thoughtfully constructed, carefully implemented, and continuously improved.
