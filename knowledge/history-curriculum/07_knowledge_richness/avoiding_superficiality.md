# Avoiding Superficiality: Depth Over Breadth in History Curriculum

## Introduction: The Coverage Trap

One of the most pervasive and damaging tendencies in history curriculum design is the relentless drive for coverage—the belief that a "good" history education is one that touches upon as many topics, periods, and places as possible. This approach, often driven by well-intentioned attempts to ensure pupils encounter "the full sweep" of human history, frequently produces the opposite of its intended effect: superficial understanding, fragmented knowledge, and pupils who can recall disconnected facts but cannot think historically.

The danger of the coverage approach is not merely that pupils learn less; it is that they learn something fundamentally different from what history education should provide. When teachers feel compelled to "get through" a vast expanse of content, the intellectual work of history—questioning evidence, evaluating interpretations, understanding causation, recognising change and continuity—is inevitably sacrificed. Pupils receive a diet of predigested narratives, simplified for speed rather than constructed for understanding.

This knowledge file examines the problems of superficiality in history teaching, explores why the coverage model persists despite its evident failures, and sets out practical strategies for achieving the depth that enables genuine historical understanding.

## Part 1: Understanding the Problem

### The Illusion of Coverage

Coverage-based curriculum design rests on a series of problematic assumptions. First, it assumes that exposure equals learning—that merely encountering a topic, however briefly, leaves some lasting educational residue. Second, it assumes that breadth of coverage is a proxy for educational quality, as if the sheer number of topics studied somehow enriches pupils' understanding of the past. Third, and most damagingly, it assumes that historical knowledge consists primarily of factual information about what happened, rather than understanding of how we know what happened and why interpretations differ.

These assumptions collapse under scrutiny. Christine Counsell's influential work on "residue" demonstrates that what remains with pupils years after they have left school is not the factual minutiae they encountered, but the deeper structures of understanding they developed. A pupil who has studied one period in genuine depth, grappling with questions of evidence, interpretation, and historical significance, retains far more valuable residue than one who has raced through ten topics, acquiring only disconnected snippets of information that soon fade.

The coverage illusion is particularly seductive because it can appear successful in the short term. Pupils can be taught to perform adequately on assessments that test recall of factual information. They can recite key dates, identify famous figures, and summarise events. This apparent success masks a deeper failure: they have not learned to think historically. They cannot evaluate why sources differ, cannot explain why historians disagree, and cannot transfer their learning to new contexts because they have never developed the conceptual tools that would enable such transfer.

### How Superficiality Manifests in Classrooms

Superficiality in history teaching takes many forms, often interrelated and mutually reinforcing.

**The Episodic Approach:** Perhaps the most common manifestation is the reduction of complex historical developments to isolated episodes or events. The Industrial Revolution becomes a list of inventions and their dates. The First World War is reduced to the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, trench warfare, and the Treaty of Versailles. Each topic is treated as a self-contained unit, with little attention to longer-term causes, consequences, or connections to broader historical patterns.

This episodic approach prevents pupils from developing the sense of period that is essential to historical understanding. They cannot grasp what made the Victorian era distinct from the Georgian period that preceded it or the Edwardian era that followed because they have studied only disconnected fragments. They lack what historical educators call "framework knowledge"—the broad understandings of how societies were organised, what people believed, and how daily life was experienced that enable pupils to situate specific events within meaningful contexts.

**The Facts-First Fallacy:** Superficial curricula often proceed on the assumption that pupils must first acquire a critical mass of factual information before they can engage in genuine historical thinking. This leads to lessons dominated by information delivery—lectures, readings, note-taking—with analysis and discussion reserved for some future point when the factual foundation has been laid. In practice, that point never arrives; the relentless pressure of coverage ensures that new factual content always takes priority over the consolidation and application of existing knowledge.

The facts-first approach misunderstands the relationship between knowledge and thinking in history. Facts do not precede thinking; they emerge through thinking. Pupils learn historical content most effectively when they are engaged in the active construction of knowledge—evaluating sources, testing interpretations, building explanations—not when they are passive recipients of predigested information.

**The Activity Trap:** At the opposite extreme, some superficial curricula mistake engagement for learning, prioritising activities that keep pupils busy without requiring genuine historical thinking. Colouring maps, assembling timelines from pre-cut cards, and creating elaborate presentations about topics pupils barely understand may produce impressive displays and apparently productive classrooms, but they do not develop historical understanding.

The activity trap is particularly dangerous because it can be difficult to detect. Pupils appear motivated and engaged. Classrooms buzz with apparent learning. But if the activities do not require pupils to engage with historical questions, evaluate evidence, or construct arguments, the busywork merely consumes valuable curriculum time that could have been devoted to genuine historical study.

**The Tyranny of the Interesting:** Superficial curricula often select content based on what seems interesting or accessible rather than what is historically significant. The gory details of medieval medicine, the peculiar habits of Henry VIII, and the sensational aspects of Victorian crime capture attention but may not contribute to the development of coherent historical understanding. While engagement matters, it cannot be the sole criterion for content selection. The question must always be: what historical understanding will this content help pupils develop?

## Part 2: The Pedagogical Case for Depth

### What Depth Looks Like in Practice

Depth in history curriculum does not simply mean spending more time on fewer topics. It means structuring teaching so that pupils engage with historical content at multiple levels simultaneously: establishing narrative coherence, developing conceptual understanding, and practising disciplinary thinking.

At the level of **narrative coherence**, depth means ensuring pupils grasp the essential story of the period they are studying—not every detail, but the fundamental contours of how and why things changed. This requires careful sequencing of content, explicit attention to causal relationships, and regular opportunities for pupils to articulate their understanding of the broader narrative.

At the level of **conceptual understanding**, depth means ensuring pupils develop sophisticated grasp of the second-order concepts that structure historical thinking: causation, change and continuity, similarity and difference, significance, and interpretation. These concepts are not abstract frameworks to be taught separately from content; they are developed through repeated application to specific historical contexts.

At the level of **disciplinary thinking**, depth means ensuring pupils regularly engage in the authentic practices of history: working with primary sources, evaluating historical interpretations, constructing arguments based on evidence, and recognising how historical knowledge is constructed and contested.

A deep curriculum weaves these three levels together. When pupils study the Industrial Revolution in depth, they do not simply learn what happened; they develop understanding of how economic and social change occurs, how historians debate the causes and consequences of major transformations, and how primary sources can be used to build and test historical explanations.

### The Role of Schema Building

Cognitive research provides strong support for depth over breadth in curriculum design. Learning is not the accumulation of isolated facts but the development of schemas—organised structures of knowledge that enable new information to be assimilated and existing knowledge to be retrieved and applied.

Superficial coverage inhibits schema building by presenting pupils with disconnected fragments that cannot be integrated into coherent structures. When pupils encounter dozens of topics, each treated briefly and then abandoned, they cannot develop the organising frameworks that would enable them to make sense of new historical content. Each topic exists in isolation, competing for limited mental resources rather than contributing to cumulative understanding.

Depth, by contrast, supports schema building by allowing pupils to develop rich, interconnected networks of knowledge. When pupils study fewer topics in greater depth, they have opportunities to revisit concepts, reinforce understanding, and make explicit connections between different aspects of their learning. Over time, these repeated encounters build robust schemas that can accommodate new information and support transfer to new contexts.

The schema-building function of deep curriculum is particularly important for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, who may have less exposure to historical content outside school. While pupils from historically knowledgeable families can draw on cultural capital to make sense of fragmented curriculum coverage, their less advantaged peers are left dependent entirely on what school provides. A superficial curriculum thus exacerbates educational inequality by failing to provide the structured, cumulative knowledge that disadvantaged pupils most need.

### How Depth Supports Progression

The Key Stage 3 National Curriculum for History in England requires pupils to "extend and deepen their chronologically secure knowledge and understanding of British, local and world history." This emphasis on extending and deepening—rather than merely accumulating—reflects an understanding that progression in history involves developing increasingly sophisticated ways of thinking about the past, not simply knowing more facts.

Depth is essential for this progression. Pupils cannot develop sophisticated understanding of historical concepts if they encounter each concept only briefly and in isolation. Understanding causation, for instance, requires repeated encounters with causal questions in different contexts, opportunities to compare different types of causes, and practice in constructing and evaluating causal explanations. A superficial curriculum that touches on causation once per year cannot support this development.

Similarly, pupils' ability to work with sources develops through sustained engagement with primary evidence. Reading one or two sources per topic, presented with pre-determined questions, does not develop the critical facility pupils need to interrogate sources independently. Depth provides the time for pupils to encounter multiple sources, compare them, identify patterns and anomalies, and develop their own questions and interpretations.

The progression principle also applies to pupils' developing sense of period. Genuine understanding of a historical period requires immersion—encountering multiple aspects of life in that period, understanding how they interconnect, and developing a feel for what was normal, possible, or unthinkable in that time and place. Superficial coverage produces what might be called "event knowledge" without "period knowledge"—pupils who can name key events but cannot describe the societies in which those events occurred.

## Part 3: Practical Strategies for Achieving Depth

### Curriculum Architecture for Depth

Achieving depth requires deliberate curriculum design that prioritises the development of genuine understanding over the appearance of coverage. Several architectural principles support this goal.

**The Golden Thread Approach:** Rather than treating topics as isolated units, effective curricula identify "golden threads"—key themes, questions, or concepts that run through multiple topics and provide coherence. These might include questions about power and democracy, themes of migration and movement, or concepts like revolution and reform. By organising curriculum around such threads, teachers can achieve genuine depth on the themes while touching on a range of historical contexts.

For example, a curriculum organised around the question "How and why has the distribution of power in Britain changed?" might span from medieval feudalism through the Magna Carta, the English Civil War, the Reform Acts, and the expansion of the franchise to the present day. Pupils encounter multiple periods and events, but always in service of developing deep understanding of a coherent historical question.

**The Depth Study Model:** Many effective curricula structure each year around a small number of depth studies—extended units of six to eight weeks that allow genuine immersion in a particular period or question. These depth studies are punctuated by shorter units that make connections, develop particular skills, or address gaps in chronological coverage. The depth studies provide the sites for genuine historical learning; the shorter units ensure that this learning is situated within coherent chronological frameworks.

**Building Backwards from Key Stage 4:** Given that many pupils will study history to GCSE, Key Stage 3 curricula should be designed with an eye to the knowledge and skills required at Key Stage 4. This does not mean teaching GCSE content early, but rather ensuring that the foundational knowledge and conceptual understanding developed in Key Stage 3 prepares pupils for the demands of GCSE history. Depth at Key Stage 3 pays dividends at Key Stage 4; superficial coverage leaves pupils struggling to meet the demands of more advanced study.

### Pedagogical Approaches for Depth

Curriculum architecture alone cannot ensure depth; it must be supported by teaching approaches that prioritise understanding over coverage.

**Teaching for Schema Development:** Effective history teachers explicitly support schema development by regularly helping pupils to make connections between different aspects of their learning. This might involve:
- Regular retrieval practice that requires pupils to draw on knowledge from earlier in the course
- Explicit comparison between different periods studied
- Questioning that asks pupils to apply concepts encountered in one context to new situations
- Activities that require pupils to synthesise information from across a unit or the whole curriculum

**The Enquiry Question Approach:** Structuring units around enquiry questions that require genuine historical thinking—not merely recall of information—is a powerful strategy for achieving depth. Well-designed enquiry questions are open-ended, contestable, and require pupils to engage with evidence and interpretations. They cannot be answered by simply remembering what the teacher said; they require pupils to construct arguments, evaluate evidence, and justify conclusions.

Examples of effective enquiry questions include:
- "Why did the Industrial Revolution happen in Britain first?"
- "Was the British Empire a force for good or ill?"
- "How similar were the causes of the First and Second World Wars?"
- "How far had civil rights for Black Americans progressed by 1968?"

Each of these questions requires pupils to draw on factual knowledge in the service of historical argument. They cannot be adequately addressed through superficial coverage; they demand the kind of extended engagement that depth provides.

**Reading and Writing in History:** Depth requires pupils to engage with extended texts—both primary sources and historical interpretations—and to produce extended writing of their own. Relying solely on worksheets, PowerPoint summaries, and short-answer questions inhibits the development of the reading and writing capabilities that historical study requires.

Effective history teaching includes regular opportunities for pupils to read extended historical narratives, grapple with challenging primary sources, and write at length in response to historical questions. These literacy demands are not obstacles to history teaching; they are integral to it. Pupils cannot develop historical understanding without learning to read and write historically.

**The Importance of Story:** Despite the disciplinary turn in history education, narrative remains fundamental to historical understanding. Humans think in stories, and pupils need coherent narratives of the past to organise their knowledge and make sense of new information. Depth allows teachers to tell—and pupils to learn—the stories that provide frameworks for understanding.

This does not mean returning to a simplistic "great man" or Whig interpretation of history. Historical narratives can incorporate complexity, contingency, and multiple perspectives. But they must be narratives—accounts of how and why things happened—not merely lists of events. The coverage approach often prevents the development of such narratives by presenting pupils with disconnected fragments rather than coherent stories.

## Part 4: Addressing Objections and Challenges

### "But We Need to Cover the National Curriculum"

The National Curriculum for History at Key Stage 3 does not require comprehensive coverage of British and world history. It requires that pupils extend and deepen their knowledge of British, local, and world history, and it specifies some topics that must be taught (including the development of Church, state and society in Medieval Britain 1066-1509; the development of Church, state and society in Britain 1509-1745; ideas, political power, industry and empire: Britain, 1745-1901; challenges for Britain, Europe and the wider world 1901 to the present day; and at least one study of a significant society or issue in world history).

These requirements can be met—and met well—without superficial coverage. Indeed, they are best met through depth studies that enable pupils to genuinely understand the periods and questions specified. The requirement to study "at least one study of a significant society or issue in world history" is deliberately open-ended, allowing schools to choose depth over breadth.

### "But Pupils Will Have Gaps in Their Knowledge"

All pupils have gaps in their historical knowledge. No curriculum, however comprehensive, can cover the full sweep of human history. The question is not whether gaps will exist—they will—but what kind of knowledge pupils will have in the areas they have studied.

A pupil who has studied eight topics superficially has gaps everywhere: shallow, fragmented knowledge that does not support further learning. A pupil who has studied four topics in depth also has gaps, but in the areas they have studied, they have the kind of robust, interconnected knowledge that supports further learning and enables them to approach new topics with the conceptual tools and historical understanding that will help them make sense of unfamiliar content.

Moreover, pupils with deep knowledge of some areas are better equipped to learn independently about other areas. They understand how historical knowledge is constructed, how to evaluate sources and interpretations, and how to build historical arguments. Pupils with only superficial knowledge lack these capabilities and are dependent on others to provide them with predigested information.

### "But Pupils Need Context for Key Stage 4"

GCSE history specifications require knowledge of particular periods, and some teachers worry that depth at Key Stage 3 will leave pupils without the broad context they need for GCSE study. This concern is misplaced.

First, different GCSE specifications require knowledge of different periods. No Key Stage 3 curriculum can provide comprehensive preparation for all possible GCSE topics. What Key Stage 3 can and should provide is the foundational knowledge and conceptual understanding that will enable pupils to learn whatever specific content their GCSE requires.

Second, depth at Key Stage 3 actually prepares pupils better for GCSE than superficial coverage. Pupils who have learned to think historically, who understand how to work with evidence, and who have developed robust schemas for understanding historical change and continuity are better equipped for the demands of GCSE than pupils who have raced through many topics but never developed these capabilities.

Third, careful curriculum design can ensure that Key Stage 3 provides useful context for likely GCSE topics without sacrificing depth. A depth study on the causes of the Second World War, for instance, provides excellent preparation for GCSE topics on interwar Europe, Nazi Germany, or the Cold War, while also developing transferable historical understanding.

### "But Pupils Find Depth Difficult"

It is true that depth makes greater cognitive demands on pupils than superficial coverage. Grappling with complex questions, evaluating conflicting evidence, and constructing extended arguments are harder than remembering simple facts. But difficulty is not an argument against depth; it is precisely why depth is valuable.

Education worth the name requires pupils to do things they could not already do, to think in ways they had not previously thought, to struggle with genuine intellectual challenges. Superficial coverage may be easier for pupils in the short term, but it does not develop their capabilities.
