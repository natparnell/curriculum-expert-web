# KS3 History Content Requirements

## Overview

The Key Stage 3 (KS3) history curriculum in England, as established by the Department for Education (DfE) in September 2013, represents a fundamental stage in pupils' historical education. Building upon foundations laid at KS1 and KS2, the KS3 programme of study demands that pupils "extend and deepen their chronologically secure knowledge and understanding of British, local and world history, so that it provides a well-informed context for wider learning" (DfE, 2013). This statutory framework establishes the content requirements that all maintained schools must follow, whilst allowing flexibility in how this content is organised and taught.

The 2013 National Curriculum for history at KS3 represents a significant evolution in how historical knowledge is conceptualised. It moves beyond a simple accumulation of facts to emphasise the integration of substantive knowledge (the content of history) with disciplinary knowledge (how historians construct claims about the past). This dual focus reflects contemporary understanding within the history education community, particularly influenced by the Historical Association and academic historians working in teacher education.

## Statutory Aims and Rationale

The national curriculum for history aims to ensure that all pupils develop six interconnected capabilities:

### Coherent Chronological Narrative
Pupils must "know and understand the history of these islands as a coherent, chronological narrative, from the earliest times to the present day" (DfE, 2013). This aim addresses a persistent concern identified by Ofsted and history educators about pupils' fragmented historical knowledge. Rather than encountering history as disconnected topics, pupils should develop an overarching sense of how British history unfolds across time, understanding "how people's lives have shaped this nation and how Britain has influenced and been influenced by the wider world."

### Wider World History
Beyond British history, pupils must know and understand "significant aspects of the history of the wider world: the nature of ancient civilisations; the expansion and dissolution of empires; characteristic features of past non-European societies; achievements and follies of mankind" (DfE, 2013). This requirement ensures that pupils develop genuinely global historical perspectives, engaging with societies and cultures beyond Europe and understanding world history as interconnected rather than isolated regional narratives.

### Abstract Historical Terms
Pupils must "gain and deploy a historically grounded understanding of abstract terms such as 'empire', 'civilisation', 'parliament' and 'peasantry'" (DfE, 2013). This aim recognises that sophisticated historical thinking requires command of conceptual vocabulary. Terms like 'empire' or 'parliament' carry specific historical meanings that pupils must understand in context rather than assuming present-day definitions.

### Historical Concepts
Pupils must "understand historical concepts such as continuity and change, cause and consequence, similarity, difference and significance, and use them to make connections, draw contrasts, analyse trends, frame historically valid questions and create their own structured accounts, including written narratives and analyses" (DfE, 2013). These second-order concepts, as theorised by historians such as Christine Counsell and Michael Riley, provide the intellectual tools for historical reasoning.

### Methods of Historical Enquiry
Pupils must "understand the methods of historical enquiry, including how evidence is used rigorously to make historical claims, and discern how and why contrasting arguments and interpretations of the past have been constructed" (DfE, 2013). This disciplinary focus ensures pupils understand history as evidence-based knowledge construction rather than mere factual transmission.

### Historical Perspective
Pupils must "gain historical perspective by placing their growing knowledge into different contexts: understanding the connections between local, regional, national and international history; between cultural, economic, military, political, religious and social history; and between short- and long-term timescales" (DfE, 2013). This aim emphasises the importance of scale and connection in historical understanding.

## Attainment Targets

By the end of KS3, pupils are expected to "know, apply and understand the matters, skills and processes specified in the relevant programme of study" (DfE, 2013). This attainment target establishes an expectation not merely of knowledge acquisition but of application—pupils should be able to use their historical knowledge and skills in new contexts. Schools are not required by law to teach the example content indicated in square brackets or marked as 'non-statutory' in the programmes of study, though these examples provide valuable guidance for curriculum planning.

## Statutory Content Areas

The KS3 programme of study specifies four major content areas that all pupils must study. Within each area, the statutory document provides non-statutory examples that illustrate how the content might be approached:

### 1. The Development of Church, State and Society in Medieval Britain (1066-1509)

This first statutory area establishes the medieval foundations of British history, beginning with the Norman Conquest and extending through to the early Tudor period. The non-statutory examples suggest coverage of:

**The Norman Conquest and its aftermath**, including the transformation of English governance, landholding patterns, and the introduction of Norman-French culture and language. This might include study of the Battle of Hastings, the Domesday Book, and the construction of castles as instruments of conquest and control.

**Christendom and religious life**, exploring the importance of religion in medieval society, the role of the Church as a pan-European institution, and the Crusades as an expression of religious zeal and political ambition. Pupils might investigate how religious belief shaped daily life, education, and artistic expression.

**The struggle between Church and crown**, examining key conflicts such as the Investiture Controversy, the murder of Thomas Becket, and the broader tensions between ecclesiastical and royal authority. This provides opportunities to explore concepts of power, authority, and institutional conflict.

**Magna Carta and the emergence of Parliament**, tracing the development of constitutional limitations on royal power and the origins of representative institutions. The 1215 Charter and its subsequent confirmations can be studied as foundational documents in British constitutional history.

**Society, economy and culture**, including feudalism as a social and economic system, the role of parishes, monasteries and abbeys in religious and community life, agricultural practices, the growth of towns and trade (particularly the wool trade), and artistic and architectural achievements such as Gothic cathedrals.

**Catastrophic events and social upheaval**, including the Black Death of 1348-49 and its profound social and economic consequences, and the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 as an expression of popular discontent and the limits of medieval social mobility.

**International conflict**, including the Hundred Years War and its impact on English national identity, military development, and political culture.

**The Wars of the Roses and the Tudor accession**, examining the civil conflicts of the fifteenth century and Henry VII's establishment of the Tudor dynasty, representing both medieval dynastic struggle and the emergence of new forms of monarchical power.

### 2. The Development of Church, State and Society in Britain (1509-1745)

This second statutory area covers the early modern period, from the accession of Henry VIII through to the mid-eighteenth century. Non-statutory examples include:

**The Reformation and religious transformation**, covering the European Renaissance and Reformation context, the English Reformation from Henry VIII through to Mary I, the Elizabethan religious settlement, and ongoing confessional conflict involving Catholics both domestically and internationally (including Scotland, Spain, and Ireland).

**Expansion and early empire**, including the first English colonies in America and the beginnings of involvement with India. This connects to wider themes of exploration, commercial expansion, and the early stages of British imperial development.

**Civil wars and political revolution**, encompassing the causes and events of the civil wars throughout Britain in the 1640s, the Interregnum period including Cromwell's campaigns in Ireland, the Restoration of 1660, the 'Glorious Revolution' of 1688, and the consolidation of parliamentary power.

**Union and succession**, including the Act of Union of 1707 creating Great Britain, the Hanoverian succession, and the Jacobite rebellions of 1715 and 1745 as expressions of alternative political and religious visions for the British Isles.

**Society, economy and culture across the period**, examining work and leisure patterns in both urban and rural contexts, religion and superstition in daily life, and developments in theatre, art, music, and literature including the English Renaissance and Augustan culture.

### 3. Ideas, Political Power, Industry and Empire: Britain (1745-1901)

This third statutory area encompasses the long nineteenth century, from the mid-eighteenth century through to the death of Queen Victoria. Non-statutory examples suggest:

**Intellectual and scientific developments**, including the Enlightenment in Europe and Britain, connections to seventeenth-century scientific thinkers and the founding of the Royal Society, and Charles Darwin's 'On The Origin of Species' (1859) as a transformative scientific publication.

**The transatlantic slave trade**, covering Britain's involvement in the trade, its effects on Africa, the Americas, and Britain itself, the abolitionist movement, and the eventual abolition of British participation in the trade (1807) and slavery itself throughout the British Empire (1833).

**Military and diplomatic engagements**, including the Seven Years War, the American War of Independence, and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. These conflicts shaped Britain's international position and domestic politics.

**Industrialisation**, exploring Britain as "the first industrial nation" and the profound impact of industrialisation on society, including urbanisation, changes in working patterns, environmental transformation, and new social formations including the industrial working class and industrial bourgeoisie.

**Political development and reform**, including party politics evolution, the extension of the franchise through Reform Acts, and social reform movements addressing issues such as child labour, public health, and education.

**Imperial expansion**, examining the development of the British Empire with opportunity for depth study (for example, of India), including the mechanisms of imperial control, the economic and cultural impacts of empire, and resistance to imperial rule.

**Irish questions**, including the Union of 1801, movements for Home Rule, and the complex relationship between Britain and Ireland throughout this period.

### 4. Challenges for Britain, Europe and the Wider World (1901 to the Present Day)

The fourth statutory area brings the narrative to the contemporary world, beginning with the death of Queen Victoria. The non-statutory examples specify that "in addition to studying the Holocaust," this period could include:

**Women's suffrage**, examining the campaigns for women's right to vote, the tactics employed by suffragists and suffragettes, and the eventual achievement of partial (1918) and then equal (1928) suffrage.

**The First World War**, including causes, course, and consequences, with particular attention to the Peace Settlement and its longer-term implications for European and world history.

**The inter-war years**, encompassing the Great Depression, the rise of dictators in Europe, and the gathering international tensions that would lead to another world war.

**The Second World War**, including the wartime leadership of Winston Churchill and the profound transformations—social, economic, and political—that the war brought to Britain.

**The welfare state**, examining the creation and development of the post-war welfare state, including the establishment of the National Health Service and the broader social democratic settlement of the 1945-51 period.

**Decolonisation**, including Indian independence in 1947 and the broader process of imperial dissolution, examining how Britain's relationship with its former colonies transformed in the post-war period.

**Post-war transformation**, covering social, cultural, and technological changes in post-war British society, including immigration, changing family structures, youth culture, and the digital revolution.

**Britain's place in the world since 1945**, including membership of and departure from the European Union, relationships with the United States and Commonwealth nations, and evolving defence and foreign policies.

## Local History Requirements

In addition to the four national/international content areas, the statutory programme of study requires that pupils engage with "a local history study." Non-statutory examples suggest this might take the form of:

- A depth study linked to one of the British areas of study listed above, using local examples to illuminate national developments
- A study over time, testing how far sites in the locality reflect aspects of national history (some sites may predate 1066)
- A study of an aspect or site in local history dating from a period before 1066

This requirement ensures that pupils connect national narratives to their immediate environment, understanding how broad historical processes manifested in specific local contexts.

## Additional Thematic Study Requirements

The statutory programme requires "the study of an aspect or theme in British history that consolidates and extends pupils' chronological knowledge from before 1066." Non-statutory examples suggest:

- The changing nature of political power in Britain, traced through selective case studies from the Iron Age to the present
- Britain's changing landscape from the Iron Age to the present
- A study of an aspect of social history, such as the impact through time of the migration of people to, from and within the British Isles
- A study in depth into a significant turning point, for example, the Neolithic Revolution

This requirement addresses concerns that the post-1066 focus of the four main content areas might leave pupils without understanding of earlier British history, whilst also allowing schools to explore themes that cut across conventional period boundaries.

## World History Requirements

Finally, the statutory programme requires "at least one study of a significant society or issue in world history and its interconnections with other world developments." Non-statutory examples include:

- Mughal India (1526-1857)
- China's Qing dynasty (1644-1911)
- Changing Russian empires (c.1800-1989)
- USA in the 20th century

This requirement ensures that pupils engage seriously with world history beyond the British context, understanding the development of other major societies and their interconnections with global processes.

## Pedagogical Implications

The 2013 National Curriculum's content requirements carry significant pedagogical implications that curriculum designers and teachers must consider:

### The Overview-Depth Balance
The statutory programme explicitly states that "teachers should combine overview and depth studies to help pupils understand both the long arc of development and the complexity of specific aspects of the content" (DfE, 2013). This balance is essential—pupils need both the "big picture" of long-term change and the detailed understanding that comes from focused depth study. Christine Counsell's concept of "curricular coherence" is relevant here: depth studies should be chosen strategically to illuminate broader developments, not merely as disconnected case studies.

### Chronological Security
The repeated emphasis on "chronologically secure knowledge" reflects a concern that pupils should not merely encounter historical content but should understand its temporal location and relationship to other periods. This requires explicit attention to chronology in curriculum design, including opportunities for pupils to make connections across time and to understand how different periods relate to one another.

### Integration of Substantive and Disciplinary Knowledge
The content requirements must be understood alongside the aims relating to historical concepts and methods of enquiry. Teaching the statutory content is not merely a matter of transmitting information about the past; it is about using that content as the medium through which pupils develop historical thinking. This has implications for assessment as well as pedagogy—assessment should examine not merely what pupils know but how they can use their knowledge in historically sophisticated ways.

### The Role of Non-Statutory Examples
The non-statutory examples in square brackets provide valuable guidance for curriculum planning, but schools are not legally required to follow them. This creates flexibility for schools to design curricula that reflect their contexts and priorities, whilst ensuring that all pupils study the statutory content areas. However, the examples represent thoughtful suggestions developed by curriculum experts and the historical community; they merit serious consideration even where schools choose alternative approaches.

## Assessment and Accountability

Under the current inspection framework, Ofsted evaluates history curricula through 'deep dives' that examine curriculum intent, implementation, and impact. Inspectors consider whether the curriculum covers the statutory content requirements, but also—and crucially—how well the curriculum enables pupils to achieve the broader aims of the national curriculum. A curriculum that mechanically covers all statutory content but fails to develop pupils' historical thinking would not be judged favourably.

The removal of national curriculum levels in 2014 means that schools must develop their own assessment approaches. Effective assessment in history should evaluate both substantive knowledge (do pupils know the content?) and disciplinary understanding (can pupils think historically?). This might include assessment of pupils' ability to construct historical arguments, evaluate sources, and understand historical interpretations.

## Conclusion

The KS3 history content requirements established in 2013 represent a demanding but coherent framework for historical education. They require pupils to engage with British history from 1066 to the present, to study local history and world history, and to develop both substantive knowledge and disciplinary understanding. The statutory framework provides clear requirements whilst allowing flexibility in implementation, enabling schools to design curricula that meet their pupils' needs whilst ensuring all pupils develop the historical knowledge and thinking essential for informed citizenship and further study.

The success of the KS3 history curriculum ultimately depends on how schools interpret and implement these requirements—on whether they create programmes of study that genuinely extend and deepen pupils' historical understanding, developing not merely knowledge of the past but the intellectual tools for thinking historically about the world.
