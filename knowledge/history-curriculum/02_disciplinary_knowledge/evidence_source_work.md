# Evidence and Source Work: Teaching the Second-Order Concept in History

## Introduction: Understanding Evidence and Source Work as a Historical Concept

Evidence and source work stands as one of the six second-order concepts in the National Curriculum for history, alongside continuity and change, cause and consequence, similarity and difference, significance, and historical interpretations. Ofsted's Research Review Series: History (2021) identifies these concepts as fundamental to how pupils learn to think historically, noting that they "inform the types of questions historians ask about past events, people and situations."

Teaching evidence and source work requires pupils to move beyond simply extracting information from historical documents toward sophisticated analysis of how historians construct knowledge about the past. This involves understanding that sources are the raw material from which historical accounts are constructed, that all sources have limitations, and that historical understanding emerges from the critical evaluation of multiple sources.

This knowledge file provides a comprehensive framework for teaching evidence and source work across all key stages, including progression models, classroom strategies, common misconceptions, and practical activities grounded in research and professional practice.

## The Nature of Evidence and Source Work in Historical Enquiry

### Defining the Concept

Evidence and source work as a second-order concept concerns the analytical process by which historians—and pupils—use historical sources to construct knowledge about the past. Christine Counsell and the Historical Association Secondary Committee (1997) conceptualised this as part of the disciplinary framework that shapes historical thinking.

Unlike other second-order concepts that focus on relationships between historical events, evidence and source work focuses on the epistemological foundations of historical knowledge—how we know what we know about the past. The concept requires pupils to:

- Distinguish between primary and secondary sources and understand the different uses of each
- Recognise that sources provide evidence but must be interrogated critically
- Understand that all sources have limitations (silences, biases, gaps)
- Evaluate the usefulness and reliability of sources for particular enquiries
- Construct historical arguments by synthesising evidence from multiple sources
- Recognise that historical knowledge is constructed from fragmentary and partial evidence

### The Relationship to Other Second-Order Concepts

Evidence and source work operates in dynamic relationship with other disciplinary concepts. When pupils evaluate sources about the causes of an event, they engage simultaneously with cause and consequence. When they assess the significance of particular sources, they draw on their understanding of historical significance. When they compare different accounts of the same event, they engage with historical interpretations.

The CHATA (Concepts of History and Teaching Approaches) project, led by Peter Lee and Rosalyn Ashby, found that pupils' understanding of these concepts develops through interaction. A pupil who understands that historical interpretations vary is better equipped to analyse how different sources might support different interpretations.

### The Distinction Between Sources and Evidence

A crucial distinction in teaching this concept is between sources and evidence:

**Sources** are the raw materials that survive from the past—the documents, artefacts, images, buildings, and testimonies that historians study. Sources exist independently of historical enquiry.

**Evidence** is what sources become when they are used to answer a historical question. A source only becomes evidence when it is deployed in the service of a particular enquiry. The same source may provide evidence for multiple different questions, or it may provide no useful evidence for a particular enquiry.

This distinction matters pedagogically because it helps pupils understand that:
- Not all sources provide useful evidence for every question
- Sources must be interrogated to extract evidence
- The value of a source depends on the question being asked
- Evidence must be interpreted; it does not speak for itself

## Progression in Understanding Evidence and Source Work

### Overview of Progression Across Key Stages

The National Curriculum for history expects pupils to develop increasingly sophisticated capabilities in working with evidence and sources as they progress through school. The following framework outlines typical progression, though individual pupils may develop at different rates.

### Key Stage 1: Foundations of Evidence

At Key Stage 1, pupils begin to develop basic concepts about sources and evidence. Rather than using abstract terminology, teaching focuses on concrete experiences with historical materials.

**Key understandings at Key Stage 1:**
- The past can be known about through things that survive from it
- Different types of sources tell us different things (photos, objects, stories)
- Some things from the past are old and some are new
- We can ask questions about sources

**Teaching approaches at Key Stage 1:**
- Handle real and replica artefacts
- Explore old photographs and compare with modern equivalents
- Listen to oral history and family stories
- Visit historical sites and museums
- Ask simple questions about sources: "What is this?" "What does it tell us?" "How old is it?"

**Example activities:**
- Using a Victorian kitchen artefact to find out about cooking in the past
- Comparing old and new photographs of the local area
- Exploring a person's belongings (real or imagined) to learn about their life
- Using costume and props to explore life in a particular period

### Key Stage 2: Developing Source Analysis

By Key Stage 2, pupils are expected to engage more systematically with sources and to begin evaluating their usefulness. The National Curriculum states that pupils should "understand how our knowledge of the past is constructed from a range of sources."

**Lower Key Stage 2 (Years 3 and 4):**

Pupils should begin to:
- Distinguish between primary and secondary sources in simple terms
- Ask questions about what sources tell us about the past
- Identify obvious bias or gaps in sources
- Use multiple sources to build up a picture of the past
- Recognise that some sources are more useful than others for particular questions

**Upper Key Stage 2 (Years 5 and 6):**

Pupils should develop:
- Understanding that sources may be biased or partial
- Ability to evaluate the reliability of sources based on authorship and purpose
- Recognition that sources need to be interpreted and do not speak for themselves
- Understanding that different sources may give different accounts of the same event
- Ability to select appropriate sources to answer historical questions

**Teaching approaches at Key Stage 2:**
- Provide regular opportunities to work with a range of source types (documents, images, artefacts, oral testimony)
- Teach explicit vocabulary for source analysis (reliable, biased, useful, limited)
- Model the process of source interrogation
- Encourage pupils to ask questions of sources
- Use source work to develop historical empathy

**Example activities:**
- Comparing two different accounts of the same event (e.g., Norman and Anglo-Saxon accounts of the Battle of Hastings)
- Evaluating the usefulness of different sources for finding out about a particular question
- Analysing the purpose and audience of a source to assess its reliability
- Building up a picture of a historical period from multiple sources

### Key Stage 3: Sophisticated Source Analysis

At Key Stage 3, the National Curriculum requires pupils to "understand how historical knowledge is constructed from a range of sources" and to evaluate sources in more sophisticated ways.

**Key understandings at Key Stage 3:**
- All sources are partial and limited in some way
- The reliability of a source depends on the question being asked
- Sources must be contextualised to be understood
- Historians must weigh conflicting evidence and make reasoned judgements
- Historical accounts are constructed from fragmentary evidence
- Silences in the historical record matter

**Teaching approaches at Key Stage 3:**
- Engage pupils with complex, challenging sources
- Teach contextualisation—understanding sources in their historical context
- Develop evaluation of utility and reliability as distinct but related concepts
- Use source work to explore how historical interpretations are constructed
- Introduce the concept of historiography—how historical understanding changes

**Example activities:**
- Evaluating the utility of sources for different historical enquiries
- Analysing how historical interpretations are constructed from evidence
- Exploring the silences and gaps in the historical record
- Assessing the reliability of sources based on authorship, purpose, and context
- Comparing contemporary sources with later historical accounts

### Key Stage 4 and Beyond

At GCSE and A Level, source analysis becomes embedded in assessment requirements. Examination boards require pupils to:

- Analyse sources in their historical context
- Evaluate the value and limitations of sources for particular enquiries
- Compare sources and explain differences
- Synthesise evidence from multiple sources
- Understand how historians use sources to construct interpretations

The second-order concept of evidence and source work transfers directly from Key Stage 3, with greater emphasis on:
- Nuanced evaluation of utility
- Understanding of how historical interpretations are constructed
- Recognition of the provisional nature of historical knowledge

## Classroom Strategies for Teaching Evidence and Source Work

### The Source Enquiry Approach

Effective source teaching embeds sources within historical enquiries rather than treating source analysis as a separate skill. The enquiry approach involves:

1. **Establish a compelling question** that requires source evidence to answer
2. **Present sources** that provide different perspectives or types of evidence
3. **Guide analysis** through structured questions and activities
4. **Synthesise findings** to answer the enquiry question
5. **Reflect** on the process and limitations of the evidence

For example, an enquiry on "What was it like to work in a Victorian mill?" might use:
- Factory inspection reports (official sources)
- Workers' testimonies (personal accounts)
- Photographs (visual evidence)
- Mill owners' statements (employer perspective)

### The Circles of Context Approach

To help pupils contextualise sources, teachers can use the "circles of context" model:

1. **Immediate context:** What was happening at the time this source was created?
2. **Situational context:** What was the specific situation in which this source was produced?
3. **Authorial context:** Who created this source and what were their perspectives?
4. **Historical context:** What broader historical developments shaped this source?

This approach helps pupils understand that sources cannot be understood in isolation but must be situated within their historical contexts.

### The Five Ws of Source Analysis

A simple framework for initial source analysis suitable for Key Stage 2 and early Key Stage 3:

- **Who?** Who created this source? What do we know about them?
- **What?** What type of source is this? What information does it contain?
- **When?** When was this source created? Is it contemporary to the events described?
- **Where?** Where was this source created? Does location matter?
- **Why?** Why was this source created? What was its purpose?

These questions provide a starting point for more sophisticated analysis.

### Evaluating Utility and Reliability

As pupils progress, they need to distinguish between utility and reliability:

**Utility** refers to how useful a source is for a particular enquiry. A source can be useful even if it is not entirely reliable. Factors affecting utility include:
- Relevance to the question
- Amount of detail provided
- Type of information provided
- Date of creation relative to the events

**Reliability** refers to how far we can trust what the source tells us. Factors affecting reliability include:
- Authorship and perspective
- Purpose and intended audience
- Context of production
- Corroboration with other sources

Teaching pupils to evaluate both utility and reliability—and to understand that these are distinct judgements—develops sophisticated source analysis skills.

### Handling Source Silences

An advanced aspect of source work is recognising and analysing silences—what sources do not tell us. Teaching strategies include:

- Asking "What doesn't this source tell us?"
- Comparing sources to identify gaps
- Discussing whose voices are missing from the historical record
- Exploring why certain perspectives are not represented
- Understanding that silences are themselves historically significant

This approach connects to teaching diversity in history, as it helps pupils recognise that the historical record often underrepresents marginalised groups.

## Common Misconceptions and How to Address Them

### Misconception 1: Sources Are Either Reliable or Unreliable

**The misconception:** Pupils tend to see reliability as a binary quality—a source is either reliable or it is not.

**How it manifests:** "This source is biased so we can't use it." "This source is reliable because it's an eyewitness account."

**Strategies to address:**
- Teach that reliability is a matter of degree and context
- Show that biased sources can still provide useful evidence
- Demonstrate that even "reliable" sources have limitations
- Use the concept of "utility" to show that usefulness depends on the question
- Provide examples of sources that are reliable for some purposes but not others

### Misconception 2: Primary Sources Are Better Than Secondary Sources

**The misconception:** Pupils often assume that primary sources are always preferable to secondary sources.

**How it manifests:** "We should only use primary sources because they're more reliable."

**Strategies to address:**
- Teach that different types of sources serve different purposes
- Show that primary sources can be biased, partial, or unrepresentative
- Demonstrate how historians use secondary sources to contextualise primary sources
- Explore how secondary sources synthesise and interpret evidence
- Use examples where secondary sources provide better evidence than primary sources

### Misconception 3: Eyewitness Accounts Are Always Reliable

**The misconception:** Pupils often assume that eyewitnesses provide the most reliable evidence.

**How it manifests:** "This source is reliable because the person was there."

**Strategies to address:**
- Discuss the limitations of memory and perception
- Show how eyewitness accounts can be biased by perspective and purpose
- Use examples of conflicting eyewitness accounts
- Explore how later events can shape how people remember earlier ones
- Teach that eyewitness accounts are one type of evidence among many

### Misconception 4: Sources Speak for Themselves

**The misconception:** Pupils often believe that the meaning of a source is self-evident and does not require interpretation.

**How it manifests:** "This source tells us that..." (without considering authorship, context, or purpose)

**Strategies to address:**
- Teach that sources must be interpreted and do not have single fixed meanings
- Demonstrate how different historians can interpret the same source differently
- Model the process of interpretation, making thinking explicit
- Encourage pupils to justify their interpretations with reference to context
- Use sources that are ambiguous or contradictory to highlight interpretive challenges

### Misconception 5: Historical Facts Are Found Directly in Sources

**The misconception:** Pupils often think that historical facts can be extracted directly from sources without interpretation.

**How it manifests:** "The source tells us what happened." "We know this because the source says so."

**Strategies to address:**
- Show how historians construct knowledge from fragmentary evidence
- Demonstrate that sources need to be corroborated and cross-referenced
- Teach that historical claims are based on interpretation of evidence, not extraction of facts
- Explore how different sources give different accounts of the same events
- Discuss how historical understanding changes as new evidence emerges

## Evidence and Source Work Across the Curriculum

### Integration with Substantive Content

Teaching evidence and source work should be integrated with substantive content rather than taught as a separate skill. Every topic offers opportunities for source work:

- **Ancient Civilisations:** Using archaeological evidence, hieroglyphs, artefacts
- **Roman Britain:** Using Tacitus, archaeological evidence, inscriptions
- **Anglo-Saxons and Vikings:** Using the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Sutton Hoo artefacts, runic inscriptions
- **Medieval Britain:** Using the Domesday Book, chronicles, medieval art
- **Tudor and Stuart Britain:** Using state papers, diaries, visual sources
- **Industrial Revolution:** Using census records, factory reports, photographs
- **Twentieth Century:** Using oral testimony, newsreels, government documents

### Developing a Source Toolkit

Over the course of their history education, pupils should develop a "source toolkit"—familiarity with different types of sources and how to approach them:

**Written Sources:**
- Official documents (laws, reports, census records)
- Personal documents (diaries, letters, memoirs)
- Newspapers and periodicals
- Visual sources with captions

**Visual Sources:**
- Photographs (staged, candid, manipulated)
- Paintings and drawings
- Political cartoons and propaganda
- Maps and plans

**Material Sources:**
- Artefacts and objects
- Buildings and architecture
- Archaeological evidence

**Oral Sources:**
- Oral testimony and interviews
- Folk songs and stories
- Recorded speeches

### Longitudinal Development

Curriculum design should ensure that pupils encounter source work in increasingly sophisticated ways:

| Year | Focus | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| 1-2 | Sources tell us about the past | Using a Victorian toy to learn about childhood |
| 3-4 | Different sources tell us different things | Comparing a Roman soldier's account with archaeological evidence |
| 5-6 | Sources need to be questioned | Evaluating the reliability of Victorian factory reports |
| 7-9 | Sources are partial and must be contextualised | Analysing medieval chronicles in their historical context |
| 10-11 | Sources are used to construct interpretations | Evaluating competing historical accounts of the same event |

## Assessment and Progression

### Assessing Source Analysis

Effective assessment of source work should:
- Focus on the process of analysis, not just the product
- Require pupils to use their historical knowledge to contextualise sources
- Evaluate pupils' ability to synthesise evidence from multiple sources
- Assess understanding of the relationship between sources and historical knowledge

Assessment tasks might include:
- Analysing a source in response to a specific question
- Comparing two sources and explaining differences
- Selecting sources to answer a historical enquiry
- Evaluating the usefulness of sources for a particular purpose

### Tracking Progression

Progression in source work can be tracked through:
- Increasing sophistication of vocabulary used
- Ability to contextualise sources
- Recognition of the limitations of sources
- Capacity to synthesise evidence from multiple sources
- Understanding of how historical interpretations are constructed

## Conclusion

Teaching evidence and source work well requires more than providing pupils with historical documents. It demands:
- A clear understanding of progression across key stages
- Integration with secure substantive knowledge
- Explicit attention to common misconceptions
- Sophisticated assessment that captures genuine historical thinking
- Recognition of the distinction between sources and evidence

When pupils develop sophisticated capabilities in working with evidence and sources, they gain more than a disciplinary tool. They develop an understanding of how historical knowledge is constructed—the provisional, interpretive nature of historical understanding and the critical importance of evidence in supporting historical claims.

This understanding is foundational to historical literacy. It enables pupils to read historical accounts critically, to recognise the limitations of historical evidence, and to appreciate the craft of historical reconstruction. In an era of information overload and contested historical narratives, the capacity to evaluate evidence with nuance and precision is not merely an academic skill but a civic virtue.

As Christine Counsell has argued throughout her work, the second-order concepts provide the "grammar" of historical thinking. Evidence and source work is one of the essential elements of that grammar, enabling pupils to construct and critique historical arguments and to engage with the past in ways that are both disciplined and intellectually honest.

The ultimate goal is for pupils to understand that history is not a fixed body of facts to be memorised but an ongoing process of enquiry in which historians use fragmentary and partial evidence to construct reasoned arguments about the past. This understanding empowers pupils as critical consumers of historical claims and prepares them to participate thoughtfully in historical debates throughout their lives.
