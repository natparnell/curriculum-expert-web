# Evidence and Interpretation: Using Sources in History

## Introduction: The Relationship Between Evidence and Interpretation

Evidence and interpretation represent two interconnected dimensions of historical thinking that together enable students to engage authentically with the past. While historical sources provide the raw material from which we construct understanding of the past, interpretation involves the active process of making meaning from that evidence. Understanding the relationship between evidence and interpretation is fundamental to historical literacy, yet this relationship is often poorly understood by students and sometimes oversimplified in teaching.

The distinction between evidence and interpretation is crucial for historical thinking. Evidence refers to the traces of the past that have survived—the documents, artefacts, images, oral testimonies, and other remnants that historians use to reconstruct what happened. Interpretation involves the process by which historians and students make meaning from that evidence, constructing accounts of the past that go beyond the evidence itself. This process is always influenced by the questions being asked, the perspectives of the interpreter, and the broader historiographical context.

Teaching evidence and interpretation effectively requires more than simply asking students to "evaluate sources" or identify bias. It demands that we help students understand how historians actually use evidence to construct interpretations, how interpretations are always provisional and subject to revision, and how the relationship between evidence and interpretation is complex and contested. This document explores the nature of evidence and interpretation in history education, strategies for teaching these concepts across key stages, and approaches to developing students' sophisticated understanding of how historical knowledge is constructed.

## Understanding Evidence in History

### What Counts as Evidence?

Evidence in history encompasses all the traces of the past that have survived and can be used to construct historical understanding. This includes:

**Written Sources:**
- Official documents (laws, treaties, records)
- Personal documents (diaries, letters, memoirs)
- Published works (newspapers, books, pamphlets)
- Administrative records (census data, tax records, court proceedings)

**Material Evidence:**
- Artefacts and objects
- Buildings and architecture
- Archaeological remains
- Works of art and visual culture

**Oral Evidence:**
- Oral testimonies and interviews
- Folk traditions and songs
- Linguistic evidence

**Environmental Evidence:**
- Climate data
- Landscape features
- Ecological records

### The Nature of Historical Evidence

Understanding the nature of historical evidence is fundamental to using it effectively:

**Evidence is Partial:**
The evidence that survives from the past is always partial and incomplete. Most of what happened in the past has left no trace, and much that did leave traces has been lost over time. Historians work with the evidence that happens to have survived, not with a complete record of the past.

**Evidence is Situated:**
All evidence was created at a particular time and place, by particular people, for particular purposes. Understanding the provenance of evidence—its origins, authorship, and context—is essential for interpreting it appropriately.

**Evidence Requires Interpretation:**
Evidence does not speak for itself. It requires active interpretation to extract meaning. The same evidence can support different interpretations depending on the questions asked and the perspective of the interpreter.

**Evidence is Contested:**
Historians may disagree about what particular evidence means, how reliable it is, or how it should be used. This contestation is a normal part of historical practice, not a sign of deficiency.

### The Distinction Between Primary and Secondary Sources

A foundational distinction in history education is between primary and secondary sources:

**Primary Sources:**
These are sources created at or near the time of the events they describe, by people who experienced those events. Primary sources provide direct evidence about the past and require students to engage directly with historical materials.

**Secondary Sources:**
These are works written by historians or others who were not present at the events described, based on their study of primary sources and other secondary works. Secondary sources provide interpretations of the past.

This distinction is pedagogically useful, but students should understand that:
- Primary sources are not necessarily more "true" than secondary sources
- Secondary sources are essential for understanding historiographical debates
- The distinction can be blurred (e.g., memoirs written long after events, which are both primary evidence of memory and secondary accounts of events)
- Both types of source require critical evaluation

## Understanding Interpretation in History

### The Nature of Historical Interpretation

Historical interpretation involves making meaning from evidence. It goes beyond summarising what sources say to construct accounts of what happened, why it happened, and what it means. Key characteristics of historical interpretation include:

**Interpretation Goes Beyond Evidence:**
Historians use evidence to construct accounts that go beyond what the evidence directly states. They make inferences, draw connections, and construct narratives that synthesise multiple pieces of evidence.

**Interpretation is Question-Driven:**
The interpretation of evidence is shaped by the questions being asked. The same evidence yields different interpretations depending on whether we are asking about causes, consequences, experiences, or significance.

**Interpretation is Perspectival:**
Historians approach evidence from particular perspectives, influenced by their own backgrounds, the historiographical context in which they work, and the theoretical frameworks they employ.

**Interpretation is Provisional:**
Historical interpretations are always subject to revision in light of new evidence, new questions, or new perspectives. This provisionality is a strength of history, not a weakness.

### Types of Historical Interpretation

Students should encounter different types of historical interpretation:

**Narrative Interpretations:**
Accounts that tell a story about what happened, organising events into a coherent chronological sequence with causal connections.

**Analytical Interpretations:**
Accounts that focus on explaining why events occurred, identifying causes, or exploring structures and patterns.

**Interpretations of Significance:**
Judgments about what matters in the past, which events or developments deserve attention, and why.

**Interpretations of Meaning:**
Accounts that explore what events meant to people at the time, or what they have come to mean subsequently.

### Historiography and Changing Interpretations

A crucial dimension of historical understanding is recognising that interpretations change over time:

**Why Interpretations Change:**
- New evidence comes to light
- New questions are asked about the past
- New theoretical frameworks are applied
- Social and political contexts change, affecting what seems relevant or important
- Historiographical debates develop and shift

**Teaching Changing Interpretations:**
Students should study how interpretations of the same events have changed over time. For example:
- How has the interpretation of the British Empire changed from the 1950s to today?
- How have interpretations of the causes of World War I shifted?
- How has the significance of women's history been reinterpreted?

## The Relationship Between Evidence and Interpretation

### Evidence as the Foundation

Historical interpretations must be grounded in evidence. While interpretations go beyond the evidence, they cannot simply ignore or contradict the evidence without justification. The relationship is not one-to-one—multiple interpretations may be consistent with the same evidence—but interpretations that fly in the face of the evidence are not valid.

### Interpretation as Construction

Interpretation involves active construction of meaning. Historians do not simply read the "truth" off the evidence; they construct accounts that synthesise evidence, draw inferences, and make judgments. This constructive process is not arbitrary—it is disciplined by the evidence and by the norms of the historical profession—but it does involve creative and critical thinking.

### The Role of Questions

The questions historians ask shape how they use evidence and what interpretations they construct:

**Question-Driven Inquiry:**
Evidence is interpreted in relation to specific questions. The same source may yield very different information depending on whether we are asking about causes, experiences, or consequences.

**Evaluating Questions:**
Students should learn to evaluate the appropriateness of questions for the evidence available, recognising that some questions cannot be answered with existing evidence.

## Teaching Evidence and Interpretation

### Progression Across Key Stages

**Key Stage 1:**
At this stage, the focus should be on:
- Recognising that the past can be known through sources
- Understanding that different sources tell us different things
- Beginning to identify what sources show us about the past
- Recognising that stories about the past can differ

**Key Stage 2:**
Progression includes:
- Distinguishing between primary and secondary sources
- Understanding that sources were created for different purposes
- Beginning to evaluate sources in terms of what they can tell us
- Recognising that historians may interpret the same evidence differently
- Understanding that interpretations of the past can change

**Key Stage 3:**
Students should develop:
- More sophisticated evaluation of sources (utility, reliability, limitations)
- Understanding of how evidence is used to construct interpretations
- Awareness of historiographical debates and changing interpretations
- Ability to compare and evaluate different interpretations
- Recognition that interpretation is shaped by questions and perspective

**Key Stage 4 and Beyond:**
Students engage with:
- Complex historiographical debates
- Theoretical frameworks for interpretation
- Critical evaluation of how evidence is used in historical scholarship
- Independent construction of arguments using evidence
- Meta-historical reflection on how historical knowledge is constructed

### Key Concepts to Teach

**Inference:**
Students must learn to make inferences from evidence—drawing conclusions that go beyond what the source explicitly states. This requires:
- Reading sources carefully for explicit information
- Using contextual knowledge to draw out implicit meanings
- Distinguishing between what sources say and what can be inferred
- Recognising the limits of inference

**Utility:**
The utility of a source depends on what we are trying to find out. A source may be highly useful for one question but not for another. Teaching utility involves:
- Focusing on specific questions rather than generic "usefulness"
- Considering what particular sources can reveal about specific issues
- Recognising that utility is question-dependent
- Understanding that sources can be useful even if not fully reliable

**Reliability:**
Reliability concerns whether a source can be trusted. However, students should understand that:
- Reliability is not an all-or-nothing judgment
- An unreliable source can still be useful (e.g., for understanding perspectives or propaganda)
- Reliability must be assessed in relation to what the source claims
- Multiple sources are needed to cross-check reliability

**Provenance:**
Understanding where a source comes from—its authorship, date, purpose, and context—is essential for interpretation. Provenance shapes how we read and use sources.

**Silences and Omissions:**
What sources do not say can be as significant as what they do say. Students should learn to recognise whose voices are missing from the historical record and consider how these silences affect our understanding.

## Practical Strategies for Teaching Evidence and Interpretation

### 1. Source Enquiries

Structure lessons around enquiry questions that require students to use evidence to construct interpretations:

**Example Enquiry:**
"What were conditions like in factories during the Industrial Revolution?"

Students examine multiple sources (factory inspector reports, workers' testimonies, factory owners' accounts, images) and construct an interpretation based on the evidence. They consider:
- What does each source tell us?
- How reliable is each source?
- How do the sources corroborate or contradict each other?
- What interpretation do we construct from the evidence?

### 2. Interpretation Comparison

Present students with different interpretations of the same event and ask them to:
- Identify how the interpretations differ
- Examine what evidence each interpretation uses
- Consider why the interpretations might differ (different questions, different evidence, different perspectives)
- Evaluate which interpretation is more convincing and why

### 3. Living Graphs

Use graphs to track how interpretations of an event have changed over time. Students:
- Plot different historians' interpretations on a timeline
- Identify periods when interpretations shifted
- Research what caused changes in interpretation (new evidence, new questions, changing contexts)
- Reflect on what this tells us about the nature of historical knowledge

### 4. Evidence Jigsaws

Provide students with pieces of evidence relating to an event but withhold some information. Ask them to:
- Construct an interpretation based on available evidence
- Revise their interpretation as new evidence is revealed
- Reflect on how new evidence changed their understanding
- Consider what evidence might still be missing

### 5. Silences and Marginalised Voices

Explicitly teach students to notice whose voices are missing from historical records:
- Study what sources exist and who created them
- Identify whose perspectives are missing (women, working class, colonised peoples, etc.)
- Consider how this affects our understanding of the past
- Explore methods historians use to recover marginalised voices

### 6. Historian Role-Play

Ask students to take on the role of historians interpreting evidence:
- Provide a set of sources on a particular topic
- Ask students to construct an argument or narrative based on the evidence
- Have students present and defend their interpretations
- Compare different interpretations and discuss how evidence was used differently

### 7. Deconstructing Textbook Accounts

Analyse how textbook authors construct interpretations:
- Examine the evidence textbook authors use
- Identify what is included and what is omitted
- Consider the interpretive choices made (what is emphasised, what language is used)
- Compare different textbook accounts of the same events
- Discuss how textbooks construct particular narratives of the past

## Common Misconceptions and How to Address Them

### Misconception 1: "Primary sources are true, secondary sources are opinions"

Many students believe primary sources are objective facts while secondary sources are subjective opinions.

**Addressing the Misconception:**
- Show that primary sources can be biased, inaccurate, or misleading
- Demonstrate that secondary sources are based on evidence and scholarly methodology
- Explore how both types of source require critical evaluation
- Discuss how secondary sources synthesise and interpret primary evidence

### Misconception 2: "Reliable sources are useful, unreliable sources are not"

Students often conflate reliability and utility, thinking unreliable sources have no value.

**Addressing the Misconception:**
- Show examples where unreliable sources are highly useful (e.g., Nazi propaganda revealing Nazi ideology)
- Discuss how reliability and utility serve different purposes
- Explore how apparently "unreliable" sources can be used critically

### Misconception 3: "Bias makes a source useless"

Students may dismiss sources once they identify bias, rather than using them critically.

**Addressing the Misconception:**
- Teach that all sources have perspective; "bias" is normal, not exceptional
- Show how understanding perspective helps us use sources more effectively
- Explore how apparently biased sources can reveal important information

### Misconception 4: "We can know exactly what happened in the past"

Students may believe that if we have enough sources, we can reconstruct the past with certainty.

**Addressing the Misconception:**
- Emphasise the partial nature of evidence
- Show how historians disagree even when using the same evidence
- Discuss the provisional nature of historical knowledge
- Explore how interpretation is always involved

### Misconception 5: "Interpretations are just opinions"

Students may conclude that because interpretations differ, all interpretations are equally valid opinions.

**Addressing the Misconception:**
- Distinguish between unsupported opinion and evidence-based interpretation
- Show how interpretations are constrained by evidence
- Discuss how historical interpretations are evaluated and debated
- Emphasise that while multiple interpretations may be valid, not all interpretations are equally well-supported

## Assessment of Evidence and Interpretation

### Assessing Understanding of Evidence

Effective assessment should evaluate whether students can:

**Extract Information:**
Accurately identify what sources explicitly state

**Make Inferences:**
Draw appropriate inferences that go beyond explicit statements

**Evaluate Utility:**
Assess how useful sources are for specific questions

**Assess Reliability:**
Evaluate the reliability of sources, considering provenance and corroboration

**Identify Limitations:**
Recognise what sources cannot tell us and what evidence is missing

### Assessing Understanding of Interpretation

Assessment should evaluate whether students can:

**Understand Interpretations:**
Comprehend different interpretations and explain how they differ

**Evaluate Interpretations:**
Assess which interpretations are more convincing based on evidence use

**Explain Differences:**
Account for why historians interpret the same evidence differently

**Construct Interpretations:**
Use evidence to construct their own historical arguments

**Reflect on Process:**
Demonstrate understanding of how historical knowledge is constructed

### Assessment Activities

**Evidence-Based Essays:**
"Using Sources A, B, and C and your own knowledge, explain..."

**Source Evaluation:**
"How useful is Source A for an historian studying...?"

**Interpretation Comparison:**
"Interpretations 1 and 2 differ about... Explain why they differ and which is more convincing."

**Inference Tasks:**
"What can you infer from Source A about...?"

**Enquiry Projects:**
Research projects requiring students to gather evidence and construct interpretations

## Conclusion: Developing Historical Thinkers

Teaching evidence and interpretation effectively is essential for developing students' historical thinking. By helping students understand how historians use evidence to construct interpretations, how interpretations are always provisional and contested, and how the relationship between evidence and interpretation is complex, we equip them to engage critically with historical knowledge.

Key principles for effective teaching include:

**Start with Enquiry:**
Frame teaching around genuine historical questions that require evidence to answer.

**Use Real Sources:**
Engage students with authentic historical sources, not simplified textbook extracts.

**Embrace Complexity:**
Acknowledge the limitations of evidence and the contested nature of interpretation.

**Make Processes Explicit:**
Teach the procedures historians use to work with evidence and construct interpretations.

**Develop Critical Evaluation:**
Help students evaluate both sources and interpretations critically.

**Connect to the Discipline:**
Show how classroom activities connect to the practices of professional historians.

By teaching evidence and interpretation in these ways, we develop students who can think historically—engaging critically with the past, understanding how historical knowledge is constructed, and recognising both the possibilities and limitations of historical understanding.

## Evidence and Interpretation in the Digital Age

### New Sources and New Challenges

The digital age has transformed both the evidence available to historians and the ways interpretations are constructed and disseminated:

**Digital Archives:**
Mass digitisation projects have made vast quantities of historical evidence available online. This democratises access but also creates challenges:
- Students may encounter sources without the contextual framing provided by archival visits
- The sheer volume of material requires new skills in searching and selecting
- Digital sources may lack the physical context that aids interpretation

** born-Digital Sources:**
Contemporary history now works with born-digital sources—emails, social media, websites—that present new challenges for preservation and interpretation.

**Visual and Multimedia Evidence:**
Digital platforms contain abundant visual and multimedia evidence that requires different interpretive skills than text-based sources.

### Teaching Digital Literacy

History education must now include digital literacy:

**Evaluating Online Sources:**
Students need skills to evaluate the authenticity and reliability of online sources, recognise misinformation, and understand how digital content can be manipulated.

**Understanding Algorithms:**
Students should understand how search algorithms shape what evidence they encounter, potentially creating echo chambers or reinforcing biases.

**Visual Evidence:**
Teaching interpretation of photographs, film, and digital media requires specific strategies that go beyond text analysis.

### Opportunities for Teaching

Digital technologies also offer opportunities:

**Virtual Archives:**
Students can access archives and museums remotely, engaging with primary sources previously unavailable.

**Digital Tools:**
Tools for text analysis, mapping, and data visualisation enable new forms of historical interpretation.

**Collaborative Learning:**
Digital platforms enable collaboration on historical projects, mirroring how contemporary historical research often works.

## Evidence, Interpretation and Controversial Topics

### Teaching Sensitive and Controversial History

Evidence and interpretation become particularly challenging when dealing with sensitive or controversial topics:

**The Holocaust:**
Teaching about the Holocaust requires careful handling of evidence and interpretation:
- Students must engage with survivor testimonies while understanding their specific nature as evidence
- Denial and distortion must be addressed through careful attention to evidence
- The scale and nature of the evidence raises profound questions about representation and interpretation

**Slavery and Empire:**
These topics involve:
- Evidence that often excludes the voices of the enslaved and colonised
- Interpretations that have changed dramatically as historiography has developed
- Contemporary political resonances that affect how evidence is read

**Recent Conflicts:**
Teaching about recent or ongoing conflicts presents challenges:
- Evidence may be contested and emotionally charged
- Interpretations may be politically polarised
- Students may have personal or family connections to events

### Principles for Teaching Controversial Topics

**Evidence-Based Discussion:**
Ground discussion in evidence rather than opinion or assertion.

**Multiple Perspectives:**
Present multiple perspectives while evaluating them against evidence.

**Acknowledge Uncertainty:**
Be honest about where evidence is lacking or where interpretations are contested.

**Create Safe Spaces:**
Establish classroom norms that enable respectful discussion of difficult topics.

**Connect to Historical Methods:**
Show how historical methods provide tools for engaging with controversial issues.

## The Role of Empathy in Historical Interpretation

### Understanding Historical Empathy

Historical empathy involves understanding the perspectives, beliefs, and experiences of people in the past on their own terms. It is crucial for interpretation but must be carefully distinguished from presentism:

**What Historical Empathy Is:**
- Attempting to understand why people in the past thought and acted as they did
- Recognising that people in the past had different values, beliefs, and assumptions
- Using evidence to reconstruct perspectives, not projecting our own views

**What Historical Empathy Is Not:**
- Sympathising with or excusing actions we find morally objectionable
- Assuming people in the past were just like us
- Ignoring the consequences of historical actions

### Teaching Historical Empathy

**Using Evidence to Build Understanding:**
Empathy should be grounded in evidence, not imagination. Students use sources to understand perspectives, not invent them.

**Contextualisation:**
Understanding perspectives requires knowledge of the contexts—social, cultural, political—in which people lived.

**Avoiding Judgment:**
While students can and should make ethical judgments about the past, empathy requires suspending judgment temporarily to understand perspectives.

**Acknowledging Limits:**
We cannot fully know how people in the past felt or thought. Empathy has limits that should be acknowledged.

## Conclusion: The Ongoing Dialogue Between Evidence and Interpretation

The relationship between evidence and interpretation is at the heart of historical practice. Evidence provides the foundation, but interpretation is required to construct meaning. This process is never complete—new evidence emerges, new questions are asked, new perspectives are brought to bear, and interpretations are revised.

For students, understanding this relationship is empowering. It shows them that history is not a fixed body of facts to memorise but an active, ongoing inquiry. It equips them to engage critically with historical claims, to evaluate the evidence behind interpretations, and to construct their own arguments about the past.

Effective teaching of evidence and interpretation develops students who:
- Can work critically with historical sources
- Understand how interpretations are constructed and contested
- Recognise the provisional nature of historical knowledge
- Can construct their own evidence-based arguments
- Appreciate both the possibilities and limitations of historical understanding

By teaching evidence and interpretation in all their complexity, we prepare students not just to study history but to think historically—to approach the past with curiosity, critical thinking, and intellectual humility. These skills extend far beyond the history classroom, equipping students to engage critically with information and arguments in all areas of life.
