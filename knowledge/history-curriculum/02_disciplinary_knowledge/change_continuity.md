# Teaching Continuity and Change as a Second-Order Historical Concept

## Introduction: Why Continuity and Change Matter

Continuity and change constitute one of the foundational second-order concepts in history education. As Christine Counsell observes, "Change and continuity are elusive prey. By contrast, cause and consequence are easier to trap. History teachers from all stables invariably know what a causation question looks like: Why was there a Russian Revolution?" (Counsell, 2011). The relative difficulty in articulating what makes change and continuity distinctive explains why this concept has historically received less pedagogical attention than causation, despite being equally essential to historical thinking.

Understanding change and continuity enables pupils to move beyond simply knowing *that* something happened to understanding *how* things transform, persist, accelerate, or stagnate across time. As Frances Blow's research for the CHATA project demonstrates, children's mastery of second-order concepts such as change, continuity and development is "fundamental to children's capacity to make meaningful sense of the stories that we teach them" (Blow, 2010).

Unlike causation, where pupils can often identify triggers and factors more readily, change and continuity require pupils to hold multiple timeframes simultaneously in mind. They must compare past states with present or future states, recognise patterns of persistence alongside transformation, and characterise the *nature* of change—whether it is rapid or gradual, temporary or permanent, widespread or localised, intended or unintended.

## Theoretical Foundations: How Pupils Develop Understanding

### The CHATA Project and Early Research

The seminal Concepts of History and Teaching Approaches (CHATA) project, conducted by Peter Lee, Rosalyn Ashby and Alaric Dickinson between 1991 and 1995 with funding from the Economic and Social Research Council, mapped how children aged 7 to 14 understand historical concepts. This large-scale empirical study revealed that progression in understanding change and continuity is neither automatic nor linear.

Lee and Shemilt's analysis of CHATA data showed that progression models based simply on National Curriculum level descriptions were inadequate. Instead, they identified distinct stages in how pupils conceptualise change:

1. **The "Everything Flows" stage**: Younger pupils often view history as constant flux, unable to identify what persists across periods. As Heraclitus observed, "Everything flows and nothing stays," and many pupils operate with this assumption.

2. **The "One Damn Thing After Another" stage**: Pupils see change as a series of discrete events without recognising deeper patterns or continuities. Change becomes a chaotic accumulation rather than structured transformation.

3. **The "Progress" narrative stage**: Pupils begin to see directionality in change—usually as improvement—but struggle to recognise continuity or regression.

4. **The "Complex Interplay" stage**: More sophisticated pupils can identify both change and continuity simultaneously, recognising that societies transform in some dimensions while preserving structures in others.

### Development and Its Distinction from Change

Frances Blow's analysis distinguishes between change (difference over time) and development (directional, often improvement-oriented change). Pupils frequently conflate these concepts, assuming that change is necessarily progressive. Teaching must therefore explicitly separate:

- **Simple change**: Things are different from how they were
- **Development**: Things have improved or evolved in a particular direction
- **Transformation**: Fundamental restructuring of systems or societies
- **Continuity**: Persistence of structures, practices, or conditions despite surface changes

## Progression Across Key Stages

### Key Stage 1 (Ages 5–7): Foundational Awareness

At this stage, pupils begin to recognise that life was different in the past. The focus should be on developing **chronological awareness** as the foundation for later change/continuity thinking.

**Characteristics of understanding:**
- Can identify obvious differences (no electricity, different clothes)
- Struggle to distinguish between decades and centuries
- Often assume their grandparents lived like Victorians
- Tend toward "presentist" judgments (people in the past were foolish)

**Teaching approaches:**
- Use living memory topics where pupils can interview family members
- Employ visual timelines with photographs showing the same location across time
- Focus on concrete, observable changes (toys, homes, transport)
- Use sorting activities: "Same or Different?" games

### Key Stage 2 (Ages 7–11): Developing Complexity

Pupils at this stage can begin to handle more nuanced comparisons across periods and recognise that some things stay the same even as others change.

**Characteristics of understanding:**
- Can compare two periods and identify specific changes
- Begin to recognise that some aspects persist (family structures, needs for shelter)
- May still assume change is always for the better
- Struggle with abstract concepts like gradual change versus sudden change

**Teaching approaches:**
- Use development studies (e.g., crime and punishment through time, transport through time)
- Employ the " layering" technique—adding new developments while acknowledging what persists
- Introduce visual representations: timelines, living graphs, change/continuity grids
- Compare everyday life across periods: what would be familiar/unfamiliar to a time traveller?

**Example enquiry questions:**
- "What changed and what stayed the same when the Romans came to Britain?"
- "How did daily life for children change between Victorian times and today—and what stayed the same?"
- "How has our local area changed since 1900?"

### Key Stage 3 (Ages 11–14): Analytical Characterisation

By Key Stage 3, pupils should move beyond simply identifying changes to characterising their nature—distinguishing between rapid and gradual change, temporary and permanent, intended and unintended.

**Characteristics of understanding:**
- Can explain the *pace* and *scale* of change
- Recognise that change and continuity coexist
- Begin to use historical language to characterise change (evolution, revolution, transformation, stagnation)
- Can evaluate the significance of particular changes

**Teaching approaches:**
- Use metaphor to problematise change (Rachel Foster's "road map" approach)
- Analyse historians' characterisations of change—why do different historians describe the same period differently?
- Employ living graphs to track change over time
- Focus on contested periods where historians debate the extent of change

**Example enquiry questions:**
- "Was the Norman Conquest a revolution or an evolution?"
- "How should we characterise the pace of change during the Industrial Revolution?"
- "To what extent did the Reformation transform English society?"

### Key Stage 4 and Beyond (Ages 14+): Sophisticated Synthesis

At GCSE and A-Level, pupils should synthesise their understanding of change and continuity with other second-order concepts, particularly causation and significance.

**Characteristics of understanding:**
- Can explain *why* historians disagree about the extent of change
- Understand that periodisation itself is a historical construction
- Can evaluate the relative importance of continuity versus change in particular contexts
- Use precise terminology (watershed, turning point, catalyst, inertia)

**Teaching approaches:**
- Historiographical debates: present contrasting historians' views on transformation
- Independent research into development over time
- Essays requiring balanced evaluation of change versus continuity
- Analysis of primary sources showing contemporary perceptions of change

## Common Misconceptions and How to Address Them

### Misconception 1: Change is Always Immediate and Total

Many pupils assume that historical events cause immediate, comprehensive transformation. When studying the Norman Conquest, for instance, pupils often imagine that everything changed overnight—language, law, land ownership, and culture.

**Addressing this:**
- Use the concept of the "soggy biscuit"—change that takes time to soak through society
- Present case studies of gradual transformation (e.g., the English language absorbing Norman French over centuries)
- Contrast official policy (what rulers wanted) with actual practice (what happened on the ground)

### Misconception 2: Change is Always Progress

Pupils frequently assume that change represents improvement. This "Whig" interpretation of history sees the past as a march toward the present, with each development being better than what came before.

**Addressing this:**
- Explicitly teach cases where change brought negative consequences (e.g., enclosure, industrialisation's social costs)
- Compare quality of life indicators across periods—were people necessarily happier or healthier?
- Use counterfactual thinking: what would have been lost if certain changes had happened faster?

### Misconception 3: Continuity Means Nothing Changed

When pupils identify continuity, they often treat it as the absence of change rather than as an active historical phenomenon requiring explanation.

**Addressing this:**
- Ask: "Why did this persist? What forces maintained it?"
- Show how continuities can be just as significant as changes
- Examine how societies actively work to preserve traditions and structures

### Misconception 4: Big Events Always Mean Big Changes

Pupils often conflate the significance of an event with the extent of change it produced. A dramatic event (a battle, a revolution) must, they assume, have produced dramatic transformation.

**Addressing this:**
- Compare different types of change: political versus social, urban versus rural, elite versus popular
- Use the iceberg metaphor—visible events above the waterline, deeper structural changes below
- Study cases where dramatic events produced limited long-term change

### Misconception 5: The Past Was Static Until Change Happened

Pupils sometimes view periods as static "blocks" of time, with change occurring only at boundaries between periods.

**Addressing this:**
- Emphasise internal dynamism within periods
- Use development studies that track change *within* eras, not just between them
- Challenge period labels: when exactly did the Middle Ages end?

## Pedagogical Strategies for Teaching Continuity and Change

### 1. The Road Map Metaphor

Rachel Foster's influential "Speed Cameras, Dead Ends, Drivers and Diversions" approach (Teaching History, 2008) uses the metaphor of a road map to help pupils characterise change:

- **Speed cameras**: Points where progress slows or stops (stagnation, obstacles)
- **Dead ends**: Attempts at change that failed or were reversed
- **Drivers**: Forces that propelled change forward
- **Diversions**: Changes of direction, unexpected developments
- **Motorways**: Periods of rapid transformation
- **Country lanes**: Gradual, slower development

This metaphor provides pupils with concrete vocabulary for describing change while problematising simplistic narratives of progress.

### 2. Development Studies and Thematic Approaches

Teaching topics thematically across time (crime and punishment, medicine, transport, childhood) naturally foregrounds continuity and change. Key principles include:

- Begin with the present or a familiar period to establish a baseline
- Move backward and forward in time to show patterns
- Use the same analytical questions across periods for comparison
- Deliberately highlight both dramatic turning points and gradual evolution

### 3. Living Graphs and Visual Representations

Visual tools help pupils track change over time:

- **Living graphs**: Plotting change on axes showing multiple variables (e.g., life expectancy and infant mortality together)
- **Continua**: Placing events or periods on scales (rapid/gradual, temporary/permanent, widespread/local)
- **Layered timelines**: Showing different types of change (political, social, economic, cultural) on parallel tracks
- **Change/continuity grids**: Systematically comparing two periods across multiple dimensions

### 4. The "Sense of Period" Approach

Denis Shemilt and Ian Dawson emphasise that understanding change requires a secure "sense of period"—knowing what characterised particular eras. Without this, pupils cannot recognise what changed. Strategies include:

- Building rich period contexts before analysing change
- Using archaeological and visual sources to establish period "flavour"
- Creating "period pen portraits" of what life was like
- Regularly returning to period characteristics when teaching change

### 5. Analysing How Historians Characterise Change

As Rachel Foster demonstrates in her later work (Teaching History, 2013), having pupils analyse how historians describe the same period differently develops sophisticated understanding:

- Present contrasting historians' descriptions of the same changes
- Ask: What metaphors do they use? What do they emphasise or downplay?
- Why might historians disagree about the extent of change?
- What evidence supports each characterisation?

### 6. Complicating Narratives of Progress

Following Hannah Sibona's approach to the Industrial Revolution (Teaching History, 2017), teachers can deliberately complicate teleological narratives:

- Present evidence of continuity alongside transformation
- Examine who experienced change and who did not
- Consider regional and social variations
- Evaluate quality of life indicators beyond economic output

## Practical Classroom Activities

### Activity 1: The Time Traveller Interview (KS2)

Pupils imagine interviewing a time traveller from a different period. What would surprise them about modern life? What would seem familiar? This reveals both change and continuity while addressing presentism.

### Activity 2: Change/Continuity Grids (KS2–3)

Create grids comparing two periods across multiple dimensions (political, economic, social, cultural, technological). Pupils categorise each cell as change, continuity, or both. This develops systematic comparison.

### Activity 3: The Living Graph (KS3–4)

Pupils plot change over time on graph axes, annotating key events. Multiple lines can show different types of change simultaneously, revealing how political revolution might precede social transformation.

### Activity 4: Historians' Tribunal (KS3–4)

Set up a tribunal where historians present competing interpretations of a period's transformation (e.g., "Was there a Renaissance in England?"). Pupils evaluate the evidence for claims about change and continuity.

### Activity 5: The Period Archaeology Dig (KS2–3)

Layer different sources from the same period to build a rich picture of life, then compare across periods. This addresses the misconception that periods were internally static.

### Activity 6: Speed, Scale, Significance Sorting (KS3–4)

Provide pupils with cards describing changes. They sort them by speed (rapid/gradual), scale (widespread/local), and significance (transformative/minor). Discuss how the same event might score differently on each dimension.

## Assessment and Progression

### Assessing Early Understanding (KS1–2)

- Can pupils identify at least three changes and three continuities when comparing two periods?
- Can they explain *why* some things changed while others stayed the same?
- Do they recognise that different people might have experienced change differently?

### Assessing Developing Understanding (KS3)

- Can pupils characterise change using appropriate vocabulary (rapid, gradual, revolutionary, evolutionary)?
- Can they explain the relationship between change and continuity (not simply listing each separately)?
- Can they evaluate the significance of particular changes?

### Assessing Sophisticated Understanding (KS4–5)

- Can pupils explain why historians disagree about the extent of change?
- Can they synthesise change and continuity analysis with other concepts (causation, significance)?
- Can they periodise independently, defending their period boundaries?

## Implications for Curriculum Design

OFSTED's 2021 research review into history and subsequent inspection guidance emphasises that effective history curricula must attend to continuity and change explicitly. Key principles include:

1. **Spiral curriculum**: Return to change and continuity concepts repeatedly with increasing sophistication
2. **Development studies**: Include at least one explicit thematic study tracking change across time
3. **Secure period knowledge**: Ensure pupils build rich period contexts before analysing change
4. **Explicit vocabulary**: Teach precise terminology for characterising change
5. **Avoid presentism**: Deliberately complicate narratives of progress

The Historical Association's "What's the Wisdom On: Change and Continuity" (Teaching History, 2020) provides an essential synthesis of professional knowledge on this concept, demonstrating how the history teaching community has developed sophisticated approaches to what was once, as Counsell notes, an "elusive prey."
