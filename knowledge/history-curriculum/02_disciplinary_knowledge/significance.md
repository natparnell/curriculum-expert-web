# Historical Significance: Understanding What Matters in the Past

## Introduction: The Concept of Historical Significance

Historical significance is one of the most challenging yet essential second-order concepts in history education. Unlike substantive historical knowledge—dates, names, and events—significance requires students to make judgments about why certain aspects of the past matter more than others. It asks not merely what happened, but why particular events, people, or developments deserve our attention, study, and remembrance.

The concept of historical significance entered England's National Curriculum in 1995 and became embedded in the assessment framework in 2008. By 2014, it was formally incorporated into the History National Curriculum aims, recognising that understanding significance is fundamental to historical thinking. However, significance remains conceptually complex because it involves not merely identifying important events, but understanding the criteria by which importance is judged and recognising that these criteria may vary across time, place, and perspective.

Teaching historical significance requires more than telling students which events were significant. It demands that we equip them with frameworks for making their own judgments about significance, help them understand how and why different groups attribute significance differently, and develop their capacity to evaluate competing claims about what matters in the past. This document explores the nature of historical significance, progression in teaching the concept across key stages, practical classroom strategies, and approaches to assessment.

## Understanding Historical Significance

### Defining the Concept

Historical significance is fundamentally about ascribing importance to aspects of the past. As a second-order concept, it operates at a metacognitive level—requiring students to think about how we determine what matters rather than simply learning what happened. Significance differs from mere "importance" because it encompasses:

**Criteria-Based Judgment:**
Significance involves applying explicit or implicit criteria to determine whether something deserves attention. These criteria might include the extent of change brought about, the duration of impact, resonance with contemporary concerns, or commemoration in collective memory.

**Temporal Dimension:**
Significance can change over time. Events considered significant in one era may be forgotten or reinterpreted in another. Understanding significance requires recognising that judgments about what matters are themselves historically situated.

**Perspective and Positionality:**
Different groups may attribute different significance to the same event. What seems significant from one national, cultural, or social perspective may appear less so from another. Understanding significance requires acknowledging these multiple perspectives.

**Connection to the Present:**
Significance often involves connections between past and present. Events become significant when they help us understand contemporary situations, provide analogies for current challenges, or inform our sense of identity and values.

### The Distinction Between Significance and Importance

A crucial distinction exists between historical significance and mere historical importance:

**Importance** refers to the immediate impact or scale of an event at the time it occurred. A major battle, a devastating natural disaster, or a political revolution might all be described as "important" because of their immediate consequences and scale.

**Significance** encompasses importance but extends beyond it to include how and why events are remembered, commemorated, studied, and used to make meaning in subsequent periods. An event might be important at the time but not significant in the long term, or conversely, an event of limited immediate importance might acquire profound significance through subsequent reinterpretation.

For example, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 was immediately important as it triggered the July Crisis and World War I. Its significance, however, extends far beyond this immediate importance—it has become a symbol of the fragility of peace, the dangers of alliance systems, and the catastrophic potential of seemingly small events.

### The "5 Rs" Framework for Teaching Significance

History educators have developed various frameworks to help students analyse significance. One widely used approach is the "5 Rs" framework, which provides criteria for evaluating historical significance:

**1. Remembered:**
The event, person, or development has been remembered at some stage in history within the collective memory of a group or groups. This might be evidenced through:
- Commemoration ceremonies or memorials
- Inclusion in historical narratives and textbooks
- Cultural memory passed through generations
- National or group identity formation

**2. Resonant:**
It is possible to connect the event with experiences, beliefs, or situations across time and space. Resonance might be demonstrated through:
- Analogies drawn between past and present events
- Relevance to contemporary debates or challenges
- Connections to universal human experiences
- Ability to illuminate current situations

**3. Resulting in Change:**
The event or development had consequences for the future, bringing about substantial and lasting change. This might include:
- Political, social, or economic transformations
- Changes in the way people thought or lived
- Long-term consequences that unfolded over time
- Fundamental shifts in how societies operated

**4. Remarkable:**
The event or development was remarked upon by people at the time or since, indicating that contemporaries or subsequent generations recognised it as unusual or worthy of attention. Evidence might include:
- Contemporary accounts expressing surprise or concern
- Unusual levels of documentation or discussion
- Recognition by those involved that something extraordinary was occurring
- Distinction from routine or expected events

**5. Revealing:**
The event or development reveals something else about the past—illuminating broader patterns, structures, or characteristics of a period. This might involve:
- Shedding light on social structures or power relations
- Illustrating typical features of a period
- Revealing the experiences of marginalised groups
- Challenging or confirming existing historical interpretations

It is important to note that these criteria are not mutually exclusive, nor must all five be present for something to be considered significant. Rather, they provide a framework for analysis and discussion, helping students move beyond intuitive or superficial judgments about importance.

### Alternative Frameworks and Critiques

While the "5 Rs" provide a useful pedagogical tool, they have been critiqued and refined by history educators:

**The Problem of Presentism:**
Some critics argue that frameworks emphasising resonance and remembrance risk presentism—judging the past by present-day concerns. While connecting past to present is valuable, it should not obscure understanding of the past on its own terms.

**Diverse Criteria:**
Different historians and educators have proposed alternative criteria. Some emphasise the profundity of change brought about, the number of people affected, or the duration of impact. The key pedagogical principle is not which specific criteria are used, but that students engage in explicit discussion of the criteria themselves.

**Student-Generated Criteria:**
Some practitioners advocate for students developing their own criteria for significance, based on their study of particular periods or topics. This approach emphasises the constructed nature of historical significance and the legitimacy of different perspectives.

## Progression in Teaching Historical Significance

### Early Years Foundation Stage and Key Stage 1 (Ages 3-7)

In the early years and Key Stage 1, children are developing foundational understandings that will support later work on significance:

**Developing Sense of Time:**
Young children are learning to distinguish between past and present, and to sequence events within living memory. This temporal understanding is prerequisite to thinking about which events from the past matter.

**Engaging with Stories from the Past:**
Through stories about significant individuals and events, young children encounter the idea that some people and events from the past are remembered and celebrated. They begin to understand that different people are remembered for different reasons.

**Personal and Family History:**
By exploring changes within living memory and their own family history, children develop early understanding that some events are remembered within families and communities while others are forgotten.

**Teaching Approaches:**
- Use stories of significant individuals (e.g., Florence Nightingale, Mary Seacole) to explore why certain people are remembered
- Compare objects and experiences from different times to develop sense of change
- Discuss why we have special days, celebrations, or memorials
- Explore family memories and why certain events are remembered

### Key Stage 2 (Ages 7-11)

At Key Stage 2, students can engage more explicitly with the concept of significance, though the focus should remain on developing intuitive understanding rather than abstract criteria:

**Introducing the Language of Significance:**
Students can begin using terms like "significant," "important," "remembered," and "changed things" to discuss events and people they study. Teachers should model this language and provide opportunities for students to apply it.

**Comparing Significance:**
Students can begin comparing the significance of different events or people within a period or topic. For example, which Roman achievements had the most lasting impact on Britain? Which individuals contributed most significantly to a particular development?

**Exploring Commemoration:**
Through studying how events are remembered—memorials, ceremonies, holidays—students develop understanding that significance involves more than immediate importance. They can explore why certain events are commemorated while others are forgotten.

**Developing Criteria Implicitly:**
Rather than teaching abstract criteria, teachers can help students develop implicit understanding of what makes events significant through discussion questions:
- Why do we still remember this event today?
- How did this change people's lives?
- Why do people think this person was special?
- What would be different if this hadn't happened?

**Teaching Approaches:**
- Use living graphs to track how the significance of events has changed over time
- Create significance "stars" or rankings with justification
- Examine memorials and commemorations as evidence of significance
- Debate which event/person was most significant in a topic
- Use the "5 Rs" framework in simplified, age-appropriate form

### Key Stage 3 (Ages 11-14)

Key Stage 3 represents a crucial period for developing students' understanding of historical significance:

**Explicit Introduction of Frameworks:**
Students can now engage explicitly with frameworks for analysing significance, such as the "5 Rs." They should understand that significance is not merely a matter of opinion but involves applying criteria and providing evidence.

**Understanding Changing Significance:**
Students can explore how and why the significance of events changes over time. They might study how interpretations of the British Empire, for example, have shifted from celebration to critique, or how the significance of women's suffrage has been reinterpreted.

**Multiple Perspectives on Significance:**
Students should understand that different groups may attribute different significance to the same event. The Battle of Hastings, for example, has very different significance for English, Norman, and broader European historical narratives.

**Distinguishing Importance from Significance:**
Students can begin to distinguish between the immediate importance of events and their longer-term significance, recognising that these do not always align.

**Critical Evaluation:**
Students should be able to critically evaluate claims about significance, asking questions such as:
- What criteria are being used to judge significance?
- Whose perspective does this judgment reflect?
- What evidence supports claims about significance?
- How has significance changed over time?

**Teaching Approaches:**
- Use structured significance criteria (the "5 Rs" or alternatives)
- Conduct "significance trials" where students present cases for/against the significance of events
- Analyse how significance has changed through studying different periods' interpretations
- Compare national and international perspectives on the same events
- Use historical scholarship to show how historians debate significance
- Engage with public history—how museums, memorials, and media construct significance

### Key Stage 4 and Beyond (Ages 14+)

At GCSE and beyond, students develop sophisticated understanding of historical significance:

**Complexity and Nuance:**
Students recognise that significance is contested, multidimensional, and subject to ongoing reinterpretation. They can engage with historiographical debates about why certain topics have been emphasised or neglected.

**Relationship to Historical Interpretations:**
Students understand how significance relates to other second-order concepts, particularly interpretations. They recognise that debates about significance often reflect broader historiographical and ideological positions.

**Meta-Historical Understanding:**
Students can reflect on how and why curricula, textbooks, and public history construct particular narratives of significance. They can critique whose stories are told and whose are marginalised.

**Independent Judgment:**
Students can make and justify independent judgments about significance, drawing on their knowledge of criteria, evidence, and historiographical context.

## Practical Classroom Strategies

### 1. The Significance Spectrum

**Activity:** Create a physical or visual spectrum from "Not Significant" to "Highly Significant." Students place events, people, or developments along the spectrum and justify their positioning.

**Variation:** Use a two-axis graph with "Importance at the Time" on one axis and "Lasting Significance" on the other to help students distinguish between immediate impact and long-term significance.

**Pedagogical Purpose:** This activity helps students visualise relative significance and practise justifying judgments using criteria.

### 2. Significance Trials

**Activity:** Hold a "trial" where students present evidence for or against the significance of a particular event or person. Prosecution argues for significance using the "5 Rs" or other criteria; defence argues against or for limited significance.

**Roles:** Students can take on roles as lawyers presenting cases, witnesses providing evidence from primary sources, or jury members making final judgments.

**Pedagogical Purpose:** This develops argumentation skills, requires use of evidence, and makes criteria for significance explicit.

### 3. Memorial and Commemoration Analysis

**Activity:** Study how events are commemorated through memorials, ceremonies, statues, and anniversaries. Analyse what these commemorations reveal about how significance has been constructed and contested.

**Questions:**
- When was this memorial created and why then?
- What message does it convey about the event's significance?
- Who does it include and exclude?
- Has its significance changed over time?

**Pedagogical Purpose:** This connects significance to collective memory and public history, helping students understand that significance involves more than academic judgment.

### 4. Changing Significance Over Time

**Activity:** Create a timeline showing how interpretations of an event's significance have changed. Use textbook extracts, media coverage, or historical scholarship from different periods.

**Example:** Track how the significance of the British Empire was presented in textbooks from the 1950s, 1980s, and 2020s.

**Pedagogical Purpose:** This develops understanding that significance is not fixed but constructed and reconstructed over time.

### 5. Contemporary Connections

**Activity:** Explore how historical events are used as analogies for contemporary situations. Analyse how present concerns shape which past events are considered significant.

**Example:** Study how references to appeasement, the Holocaust, or the Civil Rights Movement are used in contemporary political discourse.

**Pedagogical Purpose:** This develops understanding of resonance while also encouraging critical thinking about presentism.

### 6. Comparative Significance

**Activity:** Compare the significance attributed to the same event from different national, cultural, or social perspectives.

**Example:** Compare how the Battle of Waterloo is presented in British, French, and German historical narratives.

**Pedagogical Purpose:** This develops understanding of perspective and positionality in judgments of significance.

### 7. The "So What?" Test

**Activity:** When studying any event, person, or development, explicitly ask "So what?" Require students to explain why it matters—what difference it made, what it reveals, why we should remember it.

**Pedagogical Purpose:** This simple question encourages students to move beyond factual recall to thinking about meaning and importance.

### 8. Building Criteria Together

**Activity:** Rather than introducing pre-determined criteria, have students study several events that are generally agreed to be significant. Ask them to identify what these events have in common and develop their own criteria for significance.

**Pedagogical Purpose:** This develops ownership of the concept and understanding that criteria are constructed rather than given.

## Common Misconceptions and How to Address Them

### Misconception 1: "Significant means big or famous"

Many students equate significance with scale, drama, or fame. They may see battles as significant while overlooking gradual social changes, or focus on famous individuals while neglecting collective actions.

**Addressing the Misconception:**
- Study events of limited immediate scale but profound long-term consequences (e.g., the signing of the Magna Carta, early environmental legislation)
- Examine how ordinary people's actions contributed to significant changes
- Use the "Revealing" criterion to show how apparently small events illuminate broader patterns
- Discuss how some "famous" events have limited lasting significance

### Misconception 2: "Significance is fixed and universal"

Students often assume that significance is an inherent quality of events rather than a judgment made by particular people at particular times. They may struggle with the idea that significance changes.

**Addressing the Misconception:**
- Explicitly study how interpretations of significance have changed over time
- Compare how different textbooks or cultures attribute different significance to the same events
- Analyse why certain events have been "forgotten" and then "remembered"
- Discuss current debates about which historical figures should be commemorated

### Misconception 3: "Everything in the textbook is significant"

Students may assume that because something appears in a textbook or curriculum, it must be significant, without considering the criteria or processes by which curriculum content is selected.

**Addressing the Misconception:**
- Discuss curriculum construction—who decides what to include and why?
- Study topics that have been removed from or added to the curriculum over time
- Critically evaluate whether everything studied deserves the same attention
- Consider what has been left out of standard narratives and why

### Misconception 4: "Significant events are always positive"

Students may associate significance with celebration or positive outcomes, struggling to see tragic or controversial events as significant.

**Addressing the Misconception:**
- Study events that are significant precisely because of their tragic consequences (e.g., the Holocaust, the slave trade)
- Discuss how societies grapple with commemorating traumatic events
- Explore the significance of failures, disasters, and dark periods of history
- Analyse how "negative" events have shaped subsequent developments

### Misconception 5: "Significance is just opinion"

Some students conclude that because significance judgments vary, they are merely matters of opinion with no basis in evidence or reasoning.

**Addressing the Misconception:**
- Emphasise that while significance judgments involve interpretation, they must be supported by evidence
- Model how historians use criteria and evidence to support claims about significance
- Require students to justify significance claims using specific evidence
- Discuss how historical consensus about significance emerges through debate and evidence

## Assessment of Historical Significance

### Principles for Assessment

Assessing understanding of historical significance presents particular challenges because it involves judgment rather than factual recall. Effective assessment should:

**Focus on Reasoning, Not Conclusion:**
The goal is not for students to arrive at "correct" judgments about which events are significant, but to demonstrate understanding of how significance is determined and to support their judgments with appropriate reasoning and evidence.

**Use Varied Assessment Formats:**
Different formats reveal different aspects of understanding:
- Written essays demonstrate extended reasoning
- Presentations reveal ability to communicate significance claims
- Visual representations (graphs, diagrams) show conceptual understanding
- Discussions reveal ability to engage with multiple perspectives

**Assess Across Multiple Topics:**
Students should demonstrate understanding of significance in relation to different historical periods and topics, showing they can transfer the concept across contexts.

**Include Reflection on Criteria:**
Assessment should include opportunities for students to articulate the criteria they are using and to reflect on how these criteria shape their judgments.

### Assessment Activities

**1. Significance Essays:**
"How significant was [event/person/development]? Support your answer with reference to [specific criteria]."

This format allows students to demonstrate their ability to apply criteria, use evidence, and construct arguments about significance.

**2. Comparative Significance Tasks:**
"Which was more significant: [Event A] or [Event B]? Use criteria to justify your answer."

This requires students to apply criteria systematically and compare relative significance.

**3. Changing Significance Analysis:**
"How and why has the significance of [event] changed over time?"

This assesses understanding of the constructed and contested nature of significance.

**4. Significance Justification:**
"Explain why [event] deserves a place in the curriculum. What criteria support its inclusion?"

This connects significance to curriculum decisions and requires meta-historical thinking.

**5. Criteria Evaluation:**
"Which criterion for significance do you think is most important? Justify your choice with reference to specific examples."

This assesses understanding of the criteria themselves and ability to apply them reflectively.

### Marking and Feedback

When assessing significance, markers should look for:

**Use of Criteria:**
Does the student apply explicit criteria for significance? Do they understand what makes something significant beyond mere assertion?

**Use of Evidence:**
Does the student support significance claims with specific historical evidence? Is the evidence relevant to the criteria used?

**Recognition of Complexity:**
Does the student acknowledge that significance may vary by perspective, time period, or context? Do they recognise that significance is contested?

**Recognition of Change Over Time:**
Does the student understand that significance can change? Can they explain how and why significance has been reinterpreted?

**Quality of Argumentation:**
Is the reasoning clear and logical? Does the student construct coherent arguments linking criteria, evidence, and conclusions?

## Significance and the History Curriculum

### Integrating Significance Across Topics

Rather than teaching significance as a discrete topic, it should be integrated across the curriculum:

**Framing Questions:**
Use enquiry questions that foreground significance:
- "Why does the Norman Conquest still matter?"
- "What was the most significant change brought by the Industrial Revolution?"
- "Why should we remember the Holocaust?"

**Explicit Discussion:**
Regularly pause to discuss why particular content is significant. Make significance a routine part of historical study.

**Return and Review:**
Revisit topics to discuss how their significance has been reinterpreted or to compare their significance to subsequently studied topics.

**Connect to Collective Memory:**
Link curriculum content to commemoration, memorials, and public history. Discuss why certain topics are remembered while others are forgotten.

### Significance and Curriculum Design

Understanding significance has implications for curriculum design:

**Selection of Content:**
The curriculum should include content that is genuinely significant—content that reveals important aspects of the past, illuminates broader patterns, and helps students understand how we got to the present.

**Balancing Coverage:**
While not everything can be studied in depth, the curriculum should ensure students encounter significant topics across different periods, places, and scales.

**Inclusion of Diverse Perspectives:**
The curriculum should include content significant from diverse perspectives, not only from dominant historical narratives.

**Making Criteria Explicit:**
Curriculum rationale should articulate why particular content has been selected and what criteria for significance have been used.

## Challenges and Controversies

### The Challenge of Presentism

A persistent challenge in teaching significance is avoiding presentism—judging the past solely by present-day concerns. While connecting past to present is valuable, it should not obscure understanding of the past on its own terms.

**Strategies:**
- Encourage students to consider what significance events had for people at the time
- Study how significance has changed over time, not only how it connects to the present
- Use primary sources to understand contemporaries' perspectives on significance
- Discuss how present concerns shape which aspects of the past we consider significant

### Whose Significance? Power and Curriculum

Decisions about significance are never neutral. They reflect power relations and cultural values. The curriculum has historically emphasised certain perspectives while marginalising others.

**Strategies:**
- Critically examine whose stories are told and whose are marginalised
- Include diverse perspectives on significance
- Discuss how power shapes historical memory and commemoration
- Empower students to question and critique received narratives of significance

### The Risk of Relativism

While recognising that significance is contested, we must avoid the trap of thinking all judgments about significance are equally valid. Some events demonstrably had more profound, lasting, and widespread effects than others.

**Strategies:**
- Emphasise that while significance involves judgment, it must be supported by evidence
- Discuss how historical consensus about significance emerges through debate
- Distinguish between legitimate differences of interpretation and claims unsupported by evidence
- Model how historians use criteria and evidence to evaluate significance

## Conclusion: Teaching for Historical Significance

Historical significance is not merely an abstract concept but a fundamental aspect of how we engage with the past. Understanding significance helps students see why history matters—not just as a catalogue of past events, but as a resource for understanding ourselves, our societies, and our possible futures.

Teaching significance effectively requires:

**Clear Frameworks:**
Providing students with explicit criteria and frameworks for analysing significance, while also allowing them to develop and critique these frameworks.

**Rich Content:**
Studying topics that genuinely illuminate the past and reward the application of significance criteria.

**Multiple Perspectives:**
Including diverse perspectives on what matters in the past, recognising that significance is contested and constructed.

**Critical Engagement:**
Encouraging students to question, critique, and justify judgments about significance, developing their capacity for independent historical thinking.

**Connection to Collective Memory:**
Linking classroom study to how societies remember, commemorate, and use the past, helping students understand history's role in public life.

**Developmental Progression:**
Building understanding progressively from early intuitions about importance to sophisticated analysis of how and why significance is attributed and contested.

By teaching significance effectively, we help students develop not just knowledge of the past, but understanding of why the past matters—and the critical tools to evaluate competing claims about what deserves to be remembered, studied, and learned from history.
