# Similarity and Difference: Teaching the Second-Order Concept in History

## Introduction: Understanding Similarity and Difference as a Historical Concept

Similarity and difference stands as one of the six second-order concepts in the National Curriculum for history, alongside continuity and change, cause and consequence, significance, evidence/use of sources, and historical interpretations. Ofsted's Research Review Series: History (2021) identifies these concepts as fundamental to how pupils learn to think historically, noting that they "inform the types of questions historians ask about past events, people and situations."

Teaching similarity and difference requires pupils to move beyond simplistic comparisons toward sophisticated analysis of how and why historians group people, situations, structures, and phenomena. As the Historical Association's "What's The Wisdom On..." guide observes, every time teachers challenge a pupil's use of 'they' or 'people' with questions like "Really? All of them?!", they are pressing pupils to respect the complexity of the past and to use their knowledge in pursuit of more careful consideration of similarity and difference.

This knowledge file provides a comprehensive framework for teaching similarity and difference across all key stages, including progression models, classroom strategies, common misconceptions, and practical activities grounded in research and professional practice.

## The Nature of Similarity and Difference in Historical Enquiry

### Defining the Concept

Similarity and difference as a second-order concept concerns the analytical process by which historians—and pupils—identify patterns of commonality and variation across time, place, and social groups. Christine Counsell and the Historical Association Secondary Committee (1997) conceptualised this as part of the disciplinary framework that shapes historical thinking, alongside other metahistorical concepts.

Unlike substantive knowledge about specific periods or events, similarity and difference provides a lens through which pupils examine and question how the past is categorised and understood. The concept requires pupils to:

- Identify points of comparison between historical phenomena
- Analyse the extent and nature of similarities and differences
- Question the validity and usefulness of historical groupings
- Recognise diversity within apparent uniformity
- Understand that similarity and difference are constructed through historical enquiry rather than simply observed

### The Relationship to Other Second-Order Concepts

Similarity and difference operates in dynamic relationship with other disciplinary concepts. When pupils compare life in Roman Britain with life in Anglo-Saxon Britain, they engage simultaneously with continuity and change (what remained the same, what altered), cause and consequence (why changes occurred), and significance (which differences matter most for understanding the period).

The CHATA (Concepts of History and Teaching Approaches) project, led by Peter Lee and Rosalyn Ashby, found that pupils' understanding of these concepts develops through interaction. A pupil who understands that historical interpretations vary (another second-order concept) is better equipped to analyse how different historians might emphasise different similarities or differences when comparing the same phenomena.

### Similarity, Difference, and Diversity

A crucial dimension of this concept is its connection to teaching diversity in the past. The Historical Association emphasises that history lessons should enable students to see their connection to the past and to understand the world through exploring the diversity of human experience. Teaching similarity and difference becomes a vehicle for examining how past societies contained multiple perspectives, experiences, and identities—not as a simple celebration of difference, but as a nuanced understanding of how diverse groups experienced historical events and structures.

This matters particularly for curriculum design following the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities (CRED) report (2021), which highlighted the importance of including multiple perspectives to develop pupils' understanding of the contributions of ethnic minorities to UK history and society. Teaching similarity and difference well enables pupils to recognise that categories like 'the Romans' or 'the Victorians' encompassed people with vastly different experiences based on gender, class, ethnicity, geography, and status.

## Progression in Understanding Similarity and Difference

### Overview of Progression Across Key Stages

The National Curriculum for history expects pupils to develop increasingly sophisticated capabilities in analysing similarity and difference as they progress through school. The following framework outlines typical progression, though individual pupils may develop at different rates and teaching should respond to pupils' current understanding rather than simply their chronological age.

### Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS)

In the EYFS, children develop foundational concepts through the 'Understanding the World' area of learning. While not explicitly framed as 'similarity and difference', young children begin to:

- Notice differences between their own lives and those of people in the past
- Identify simple similarities (people in the past had families, ate food, played games)
- Begin to recognise that not everyone in the past lived in the same way
- Develop vocabulary for describing differences (old/new, then/now)

Polly Gillow's work on 'Similarity and difference with a tasty twist' (Primary History, 2024) demonstrates how EYFS practitioners can use concrete experiences—comparing foods, clothes, or homes—to introduce these concepts in age-appropriate ways.

### Key Stage 1: Establishing Foundations

At Key Stage 1, pupils work within simple chronological frameworks and begin to identify basic differences and similarities. Typical characteristics of thinking at this stage include:

**Level 1: Simple Binary Comparison**
- Pupils identify obvious differences between two time periods ("They didn't have electricity, we do")
- Comparisons are often present-centred (how was the past different from now?)
- Similarities may be overlooked in favour of dramatic differences
- Groupings are often totalising ("Everyone in the past...")

**Level 2: Emerging Pattern Recognition**
- Pupils begin to identify similarities within a time period
- Some recognition that different groups within a society might have different experiences
- Comparisons become less present-centred, beginning to compare past periods with each other

**Teaching approaches at Key Stage 1:**
- Use concrete, visual comparisons (artefacts, images, role-play)
- Focus on everyday life to make the past relatable
- Explicitly teach vocabulary for comparison: same as, different from, similar to, unlike
- Challenge overgeneralisation gently: "Did ALL Vikings wear helmets with horns?"
- Use stories to establish that individuals in the past had different experiences

### Key Stage 2: Developing Analytical Frameworks

By Key Stage 2, pupils are expected to "note connections, contrasts and trends over time" and "understand the methods of historical enquiry." Progression in similarity and difference includes:

**Level 3: Multiple Dimensions of Comparison**
- Pupils compare across several dimensions simultaneously (daily life, technology, beliefs, power structures)
- Recognition that the same two periods might be similar in some ways but different in others
- Beginning to compare past societies with each other, not just with the present

**Level 4: Questioning Historical Categories**
- Pupils begin to question how historians group people and periods
- Recognition that categories like 'the Romans' or 'the Anglo-Saxons' encompass diversity
- Understanding that similarity and difference are matters of degree and interpretation

**Teaching approaches at Key Stage 2:**
- Use enquiry questions that explicitly focus on similarity and difference: "How similar were the lives of rich and poor in Victorian Britain?"
- Employ structured comparison frameworks (comparison tables, Venn diagrams with nuance)
- Teach pupils to identify criteria for comparison before making judgements
- Use primary sources to explore diverse experiences within a society
- Challenge pupils to find evidence of difference within apparent similarity (and vice versa)

**Common misconceptions at Key Stage 2:**
- Assuming all people in a past society shared the same experiences
- Treating historical groups as monolithic ('the Vikings believed...')
- Overemphasising dramatic differences while missing continuities
- Present-centred comparisons that judge the past by modern standards

### Key Stage 3: Sophisticated Analysis

At Key Stage 3, the National Curriculum requires pupils to "understand historical concepts such as continuity and change, cause and consequence, similarity, difference and significance, and use them to make connections, draw contrasts, analyse trends." Progression includes:

**Level 5: Analysing Extent and Nature**
- Pupils evaluate HOW similar or different phenomena are, not just WHETHER they are similar or different
- Recognition that similarity and difference exist on spectrums, not as binary opposites
- Analysis of the significance of identified similarities and differences

**Level 6: Problematising Categories**
- Pupils question the construction of historical categories themselves
- Understanding that historians' decisions about what constitutes a valid comparison reflect disciplinary conventions and perspectives
- Recognition that different historians might legitimately emphasise different similarities or differences

**Level 7: Independent Application**
- Pupils independently select appropriate frameworks for comparison
- Understanding of how similarity and difference analysis contributes to historical argument
- Ability to synthesise comparison across multiple cases or periods

**Teaching approaches at Key Stage 3:**
- Frame enquiries around sophisticated comparison questions: "How far did campaigners for women's suffrage have the same aims?"
- Teach pupils to construct and defend criteria for comparison
- Use scholarship to show how historians disagree about what matters when comparing
- Develop extended writing that uses comparison to support argument
- Explore similarity and difference across extended time periods (longue duree)

**Common misconceptions at Key Stage 3:**
- Assuming similarity in one dimension implies similarity in others
- Treating comparison as an end in itself rather than a tool for historical argument
- Failing to recognise that legitimate comparisons require careful criteria
- Overlooking the historian's role in constructing categories of similarity and difference

### Key Stage 4 and Beyond

At GCSE and A Level, similarity and difference becomes embedded in assessment requirements. Examination boards require pupils to:

- Compare interpretations of the same phenomena
- Analyse similarity and difference across specified historical dimensions
- Evaluate the significance of identified similarities and differences
- Construct arguments that deploy comparison as evidence

The second-order concepts of continuity and change, cause and consequence, similarity and difference, and significance transfer directly from Key Stage 3. The challenge for history teachers is to ensure that these concepts are not neglected in the drive to teach content, while developing the sophisticated written expression required for examination success.

## Classroom Strategies for Teaching Similarity and Difference

### The 'Too Simple!' Game

Christine Counsell developed a straightforward, low-resource activity called 'Too Simple!' (also known as 'the generalisation game') for challenging overgeneralisation and developing pupils' awareness of similarity and difference. The activity works across all key stages:

1. Pupils make a claim about a past society ("People in the Middle Ages were religious")
2. The teacher or other pupils respond with "Too simple!" and challenge the generalisation
3. Pupils must refine their claim to account for diversity ("Many people in the Middle Ages attended church regularly, though some questioned religious teachings")
4. The game continues with increasingly nuanced refinements

This activity develops pupils' capacity to recognise diversity within apparent uniformity and to express this nuance in their historical claims.

### Using Enquiry Questions

Well-crafted enquiry questions can place similarity and difference at the heart of historical investigation. Effective enquiry questions include:

- "Who supported the Nazis? What types of people joined the Chartists?" (focusing on diversity within movements)
- "How different was life in the countryside from life in industrial towns?" (social and economic comparison)
- "Compare fascism in Italy and Germany. How far were they similar?" (cross-national comparison)
- "How far did campaigners for women's suffrage have the same aims?" (diversity within activism)

The Historical Association notes that such 'similarity/difference' problems require pupils to probe or question how historians group people, situations, structures or phenomena—these range from individuals, to villages, to systems, to cultures.

### Frameworks for Structured Comparison

**Venn Diagrams with Nuance**
Traditional Venn diagrams can be extended to show degrees of similarity:
- Inner intersection: Strong similarities
- Outer intersection: Partial similarities
- Outside circles: Differences

**Comparison Criteria Grids**
Pupils identify criteria for comparison before making judgements, tracking across dimensions like daily life, technology, beliefs, and power structures.

**Similarity Spectrums**
Rather than binary same/different, pupils place comparisons on spectrums:
- Completely different — Some differences — Similar in some ways, different in others — Mostly similar — Essentially the same

### Using Primary Sources to Explore Diversity

Primary sources are essential for revealing the diversity of past experience. Strategies include:

- **Multiple perspectives on the same event**: Show how different participants experienced the same historical moment (e.g., different accounts of the Norman Conquest from Norman, English, and Scandinavian perspectives)
- **Diverse voices within a society**: Include sources from women, working-class people, and minority groups alongside more traditional sources
- **Challenging apparent uniformity**: Use sources to show diversity within groups often treated as monolithic

### Teaching 'Hinterland' to Support Comparison

As Counsell's work on 'fingertip' and 'residue' knowledge suggests, pupils need rich contextual knowledge to make meaningful comparisons. Teachers should provide:

- Detailed knowledge of specific examples that illuminate broader patterns
- Stories and contextual details that make abstract comparisons concrete
- Repeated encounters with concepts across different contexts

For example, before pupils can compare medieval and early modern monarchy, they need secure knowledge of how specific monarchs exercised power in each period. This 'hinterland' knowledge enables meaningful comparison of the 'core' knowledge about monarchical systems.

## Common Misconceptions and How to Address Them

### Misconception 1: Historical Groups are Uniform

**The misconception**: Pupils assume all members of a historical group shared the same experiences, beliefs, and characteristics.

**How it manifests**: "The Romans thought...", "Women in the past were...", "Everyone in the Middle Ages believed..."

**Strategies to address**:
- Explicit teaching about diversity within societies
- Use of specific case studies showing variation (e.g., different experiences of Romans in Rome, Britain, and the provinces)
- The 'Too Simple!' game to challenge overgeneralisation
- Primary sources revealing diverse perspectives within societies

### Misconception 2: Similarity in One Area Implies Similarity in Others

**The misconception**: If two societies are similar in one respect, pupils assume they are similar in other respects.

**How it manifests**: Assuming that because two societies had monarchies, they were politically similar in other ways.

**Strategies to address**:
- Teach pupils to compare across multiple dimensions explicitly
- Use examples where societies are similar in some ways but different in others
- Comparison matrices that track similarities and differences across different criteria

### Misconception 3: The Past Was Completely Different from Now

**The misconception**: Pupils overemphasise dramatic differences between past and present while missing continuities.

**How it manifests**: Assuming people in the past were completely unlike people today in their thoughts, feelings, and motivations.

**Strategies to address**:
- Explicit teaching about historical empathy and the human experience across time
- Focus on everyday life to establish commonalities
- Use sources showing people in the past expressing familiar emotions and concerns
- Balance enquiries between difference-focused and similarity-focused questions

### Misconception 4: Comparison is an End in Itself

**The misconception**: Pupils see identifying similarities and differences as the goal rather than as a tool for historical understanding.

**How it manifests**: Comparison tasks that ask pupils to "find three similarities and three differences" without requiring analysis of significance.

**Strategies to address**:
- Frame comparison within enquiry questions that require analysis of significance
- Ask "So what?" questions: "What do these differences tell us about...?"
- Teach pupils to use comparison as evidence in historical arguments
- Focus on the 'extent' and 'nature' of similarity and difference, not just identification

### Misconception 5: Categories are Natural Rather Than Constructed

**The misconception**: Pupils assume that historical categories (periods, groups, movements) reflect natural divisions rather than historians' constructions.

**How it manifests**: Treating 'the Middle Ages' or 'the Industrial Revolution' as clearly defined, universally agreed categories.

**Strategies to address**:
- Teach pupils about historians' debates over periodisation and categorisation
- Show how different historians draw boundaries differently
- Discuss why historians might group phenomena in particular ways
- Explore the consequences of different categorisations for historical understanding

## Similarity and Difference Across the Curriculum

### Integration with Substantive Content

Teaching similarity and difference should be integrated with substantive content rather than treated as a separate skill. Every topic offers opportunities for comparison:

- **Ancient Civilisations**: Comparing ancient Egypt with ancient Sumer; comparing different social groups within ancient Egypt
- **Roman Britain**: Comparing life in Roman Britain with life in pre-Roman Britain; comparing experiences of different groups in Roman Britain
- **Anglo-Saxons and Vikings**: Comparing Anglo-Saxon and Viking societies; comparing different Anglo-Saxon kingdoms
- **Medieval Britain**: Comparing medieval England with medieval France; comparing experiences of lords and peasants
- **Industrial Revolution**: Comparing industrial and agricultural regions; comparing working-class and middle-class experiences
- **Twentieth Century**: Comparing experiences of different groups during the World Wars; comparing fascist regimes

### Longitudinal Development

Curriculum design should ensure that pupils encounter similarity and difference in increasingly sophisticated ways as they progress through school:

**Years 1-2**: Basic comparison of past and present — "How are our toys different from toys in the past?"

**Years 3-4**: Comparing societies across multiple dimensions — "How similar were the lives of rich and poor in Ancient Egypt?"

**Years 5-6**: Questioning categories and recognising diversity — "How different were the experiences of Anglo-Saxons across different kingdoms?"

**Years 7-8**: Analysing extent and nature of similarity — "How far was life in medieval towns similar to life in medieval villages?"

**Year 9**: Problematising comparison and constructing argument — "To what extent was the experience of enslaved people in British colonies similar to that in American colonies?"

### Cross-Curricular Connections

Similarity and difference as a concept connects to learning in other subjects:

- **Geography**: Comparing places, regions, and countries; understanding spatial diversity
- **Religious Education**: Comparing beliefs and practices across and within religions
- **Citizenship/PSHE**: Recognising diversity in contemporary society; challenging stereotypes
- **English**: Comparing texts from different periods; analysing character diversity within texts
These connections should be made explicit to pupils, reinforcing that the ability to analyse similarity and difference is a transferable thinking skill.

## Assessment and Progression

### Formative Assessment Strategies

Effective formative assessment of similarity and difference requires careful attention to pupils' developing thinking:

** hinge questions** that reveal understanding: "Were all peasants in medieval England poor?" — a binary yes/no question that exposes whether pupils recognise diversity within social groups.

**Comparative writing frames** that scaffold sophisticated comparison at different levels:
- Basic: "X and Y were similar because... X and Y were different because..."
- Developing: "While both X and Y were [similarity], they differed in that [difference]. This difference matters because..."
- Advanced: "The extent of similarity between X and Y depends on which criteria we apply. In terms of [criterion], they were broadly similar; however, regarding [criterion], significant differences emerge..."

**Exit tickets** that require pupils to identify one similarity and one difference from the lesson, with a brief explanation of which is more significant and why.

### Summative Assessment

At Key Stage 3 and beyond, summative assessment of similarity and difference should require pupils to:

- Deploy secure substantive knowledge in the service of comparison
- Analyse the extent and nature of similarity and difference, not merely identify them
- Evaluate the significance of similarities and differences in relation to a specific historical question
- Construct arguments that use comparison as evidence

The Historical Association's guidance on progression in assessment emphasises that effective assessment tasks must require pupils to use their knowledge—that is, assessment must be knowledge-rich, not knowledge-neutral.

## Advanced Applications: Beyond the Classroom

### Similarity and Difference in Historical Scholarship

Pupils studying history at advanced levels benefit from understanding how professional historians employ similarity and difference:

**Comparative History**: Historians like Marc Bloch (founder of the Annales School) pioneered comparative approaches, examining similar phenomena across different societies to identify patterns and test explanations.

**Transnational History**: This approach deliberately crosses national boundaries to trace connections, circulations, and comparisons that challenge nation-centred narratives.

**Microhistory**: By examining apparently exceptional cases in detail, microhistorians like Carlo Ginzburg and Natalie Zemon Davis reveal both the diversity of past experience and unexpected connections across time and space.

Teaching pupils about these historiographical approaches can deepen their understanding of similarity and difference as tools of historical enquiry.

### The Ethics of Comparison

Comparison in history carries ethical dimensions that sophisticated pupils should consider:

- Whose experiences are made visible through comparison, and whose are obscured?
- Does comparing suffering across different contexts diminish or honour those experiences?
- How do present-day concerns shape which similarities and differences we choose to emphasise?

These questions connect history education to broader civic and ethical education, preparing pupils to engage critically with historical claims in public discourse.

## Conclusion: The Significance of Similarity and Difference

Teaching similarity and difference well requires more than providing pupils with comparison activities. It demands:

- A clear understanding of progression across key stages
- Integration with secure substantive knowledge
- Explicit attention to common misconceptions
- Sophisticated assessment that captures genuine historical thinking
- Recognition of the connection to teaching diversity in the past

When pupils develop sophisticated capabilities in analysing similarity and difference, they gain more than a disciplinary tool. They develop what the Historical Association calls "a sense of the complexity of the past"—an understanding that historical societies, like our own, contained multitudes, that groups we might casually label as uniform were in fact diverse, and that the work of historical enquiry involves constructing categories and comparisons rather than simply discovering them.

This understanding is foundational to historical literacy. It enables pupils to read historical claims critically, to recognise overgeneralisation, and to appreciate the rich diversity of human experience across time. In an era of public discourse often characterised by simplistic narratives and polarised claims, the capacity to analyse similarity and difference with nuance and precision is not merely an academic skill but a civic virtue.

As Christine Counsell has argued throughout her work, the second-order concepts provide the "grammar" of historical thinking. Similarity and difference is one of the essential elements of that grammar, enabling pupils to construct sophisticated historical arguments and to engage with the past in ways that are both disciplined and humane.
