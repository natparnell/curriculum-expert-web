# Cause and Consequence: Teaching Causation in History

This knowledge file explores causation as a second-order historical concept, examining how pupils' understanding progresses from early years through to Key Stage 3 and beyond. It draws on research from the CHATA project, the Historical Association, and Ofsted to provide practical guidance for teaching causal reasoning in the classroom.

## What is Historical Causation?

### Defining Causation as a Second-Order Concept

Historical causation concerns explaining *why* events occurred or why situations arose in the past. As E.H. Carr famously observed, "all history is the history of causes." While this claim has been widely challenged by historians anxious to demonstrate the breadth of their concerns, causal explanation remains central to history teaching and learning at all stages within the school curriculum.

Causation is classified as a **second-order concept** — a disciplinary tool that shapes how historians construct knowledge about the past. Unlike first-order or substantive concepts (such as "empire," "revolution," or "democracy"), second-order concepts describe the procedures and forms of reasoning that historians employ. Other second-order concepts include change and continuity, similarity and difference, significance, and evidence/use of sources.

### Causation Versus Description

A critical distinction for history teachers is between causal explanation and mere description or exposition. As the Historical Association's "What's the Wisdom On" guide notes, causal explanation is not about "explaining" in the sense of setting out or giving more detail about what happened. Rather, it addresses the question "How do you explain that?" — meaning "Why did this thing come about?"

This distinction matters because pupils often conflate describing what happened with explaining why it happened. A pupil who writes at length about the events of the French Revolution has not necessarily engaged in causal explanation unless they have addressed why those events occurred and why they unfolded in particular ways.

### The Relationship Between Substantive and Disciplinary Knowledge

Ofsted's Research Review Series: History (2021) emphasises that pupils' capacity to learn and use disciplinary knowledge, including in constructing causal arguments, is highly dependent on the depth and security of their substantive knowledge of the period or events being analysed. Without secure substantive knowledge, pupils' causal judgements will be ill-informed or might encourage misconceptions about the discipline.

An effective causation enquiry develops rich and secure substantive knowledge of the specific event or process across a series of lessons. This allows pupils to think about the overarching enquiry question in more complex ways. The relationship is reciprocal: approaches to develop pupils' disciplinary knowledge also secure pupils' substantive knowledge.

## National Curriculum Requirements

### Statutory Expectations Across Key Stages

The National Curriculum for history in England identifies causation as one of the key concepts through which pupils should develop their understanding of the past. While the 2014 National Curriculum uses different terminology from earlier versions, the expectation that pupils engage with causal reasoning remains central.

At **Key Stage 1**, pupils should be taught about:
- Changes within living memory
- Events beyond living memory that are significant nationally or globally
- The lives of significant individuals
- Significant historical events, people, and places in their own locality

While causation is not explicitly named at KS1, the expectation that pupils understand *why* changes occurred and *why* people acted as they did implicitly requires early causal reasoning.

At **Key Stage 2**, pupils should continue to develop a chronologically secure knowledge and understanding of British, local, and world history. The programme of study notes that pupils should "note connections, contrasts and trends over time and develop the appropriate use of historical terms" — including the language of causation.

At **Key Stage 3**, pupils are expected to:
- Understand how different types of historical sources are used rigorously to make historical claims
- Understand how and why contrasting arguments and interpretations of the past have been constructed
- Understand the methods of historical enquiry, including how evidence is used rigorously to make historical claims

### Progression in the NC Framework

The National Curriculum implicitly demands progression in pupils' handling of causation:

- **KS1**: Pupils begin to offer simple explanations for why things happened or changed
- **KS2**: Pupils recognise that events have multiple causes and begin to distinguish between long-term and short-term factors
- **KS3**: Pupils construct structured causal arguments, prioritise causes, and understand the contingent nature of historical events

## Research on Pupils' Understanding of Causation

### The CHATA Project: Mapping Pupil Thinking

The ESRC-funded **CHATA (Concepts of History and Teaching Approaches) Project**, directed by Peter Lee and Rosalyn Ashby at the University of London, represents the most significant research into how pupils understand historical concepts, including causation. Running from 1994 to 1998, the project collected evidence of children's ideas about the discipline of history and attempted to see if there was any progression in those ideas.

CHATA researchers interviewed pupils aged 7 to 14, presenting them with historical problems and probing their reasoning. For causation specifically, the project found that pupils' thinking develops through qualitatively distinct stages — not simply by accumulating more information, but by restructuring their understanding of what it means to explain causally.

### Lee and Shemilt's Progression Models

Drawing on CHATA findings, Lee and Shemilt have developed empirically based progression models that illustrate qualitative differences in pupils' understanding of second-order concepts. For causation specifically, they identify distinct levels of sophistication in how pupils reason about causes.

At lower levels of progression, pupils tend to:
- See causes as isolated, self-evident facts
- Treat all causes as equally important
- Fail to distinguish between necessary and sufficient conditions
- Assume that causes automatically lead to effects without considering human agency or contingency

At higher levels, pupils:
- Recognise that causes interact and combine in complex ways
- Understand that historians must prioritise and weigh causes
- Appreciate that events were not inevitable — things could have happened differently
- Can construct arguments about the relative importance of different causes

### Scott's 5-Stage Model for Progression

The Teaching History Research Group produced a series of stage descriptions for progression in understanding causation, sometimes referred to as Scott's 5-stage model. These stages were based on a mixture of personal experience, observation in many schools, and discussions with teachers:

**Stage 1: Fragmented Collection**
Pupils produce lists of disconnected factors without any sense of how they relate to one another or to the outcome being explained.

**Stage 2: Narrative Chain**
Pupils arrange causes into a chronological sequence, but the sequence often reads like a story rather than an explanation. The connections between causes remain implicit.

**Stage 3: Categorised List**
Pupils group causes into categories (often provided by the teacher, such as "economic," "political," "social") but do not necessarily explain how these categories interact or which are most significant.

**Stage 4: Structured Explanation**
Pupils organise causes hierarchically or relationally, showing how some causes enabled or led to others. They may begin to prioritise causes, though their reasoning for doing so may be limited.

**Stage 5: Sophisticated Causal Argument**
Pupils construct nuanced arguments that weigh causes against one another, consider counterfactual possibilities (what might have happened if...), and demonstrate awareness that historical explanation involves selection and interpretation.

These stages are not strictly age-related — pupils at Key Stage 3 may operate at Stage 2 in one context and Stage 4 in another, depending on their substantive knowledge and the support provided.

## Common Misconceptions About Causation

### The Telegraph View: A → B Thinking

One of the most pervasive misconceptions among pupils is what might be called the "telegraph view" of causation — the assumption that events follow one another in a simple, mechanical chain. In this view, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand "caused" the First World War in a direct, unmediated way, without any need to explain how or why this particular trigger led to such a catastrophic outcome.

This misconception manifests in pupils writing that "the cause of X was Y" as if this fully explains the event. Addressing this requires teaching pupils to see that causes operate at different levels, that triggers need enabling conditions, and that human choices and contingent circumstances shape outcomes.

### The "Just One Cause" Problem

Younger pupils in particular often seek a single cause for historical events. Asked why the Normans won the Battle of Hastings, they may select one factor (Harold's army was tired, the Normans had better tactics, William was a good leader) and treat this as sufficient explanation.

Teaching multiple causation requires explicit instruction in how different factors combined to produce outcomes. Activities that require pupils to consider multiple factors simultaneously — and to explain how they interrelate — help develop more sophisticated understanding.

### Present-Mindedness and Anachronism

Pupils often judge past actions by present-day standards or assume that people in the past had the same knowledge and values that we do. This present-mindedness affects causal reasoning: pupils may "explain" historical actions by attributing modern motives to historical actors or by assuming that people in the past should have foreseen consequences that were not apparent at the time.

For example, pupils might criticise medieval doctors for not using antibiotics, failing to understand that antibiotics had not been discovered. In causal explanation, this manifests as assuming that historical actors had choices that they did not actually possess.

### The Inevitability Fallacy

A related misconception is the assumption that historical outcomes were inevitable — that given certain causes, the effects *had* to follow. This determinism removes human agency from historical explanation and makes it difficult for pupils to understand that historical events resulted from choices made by real people under particular circumstances.

Counterfactual thinking — asking "what if?" questions — can be a powerful tool for addressing this misconception. By considering how events might have unfolded differently, pupils come to see that historical outcomes were contingent rather than predetermined.

### Confusing Causes with Consequences

Pupils sometimes struggle to distinguish between causes (what led to an event) and consequences (what resulted from it). This confusion may stem from the fact that, in narrative, causes and consequences are often discussed together as part of a chain of events.

Explicit teaching of the distinction — perhaps using visual organisers that separate causes and consequences spatially — can help pupils keep these categories distinct while also understanding their relationship.

### Over-Simplification of Motivation

When explaining why individuals acted as they did, pupils often rely on over-simplified motivational categories. They may attribute actions solely to "greed," "power," "religion," or "fear" without recognising that human motivation is complex and that people often act from mixed motives or from motives that made sense within their own historical context but may seem strange today.

## Pedagogical Approaches to Teaching Causation

### Enquiry Questions: Framing Causal Investigation

Michael Riley's influential work on enquiry questions provides a framework for teaching causation effectively. A well-crafted enquiry question frames an investigation, motivates pupils to acquire substantive knowledge, and requires them to deploy disciplinary thinking.

Good causal enquiry questions share several characteristics:
- They are genuinely open to argument (not questions to which there is a single "right" answer)
- They require pupils to weigh and prioritise causes
- They connect to the "big picture" of the curriculum
- They are accessible to pupils with appropriate support

Examples of effective causal enquiry questions include:
- "Why did William win the Battle of Hastings?" (KS2)
- "Why did medieval towns grow?" (KS3)
- "Was the First World War inevitable?" (KS3/GCSE)
- "Why was there a revolution in Russia in 1917?" (KS3/GCSE)

Riley warns against enquiry questions that are too broad, too narrow, or merely descriptive. The question "What were the causes of the First World War?" invites only a list; "Why did the First World War break out in 1914 rather than earlier or later?" requires genuine causal reasoning.

### Using Frameworks and Models

Various frameworks have been developed to help pupils structure their causal thinking:

**The Diamond Nine (Arthur Chapman)**
Arthur Chapman's "Camels, Diamonds and Counterfactuals" model uses the metaphor of a diamond — with the most important cause at the top and the least important at the bottom — to help pupils prioritise causes. Pupils arrange cause cards in a diamond formation, explaining their reasoning for the relative placement of each cause. This activity forces explicit consideration of the relative importance of different factors.

**Causal Webs and Connection Diagrams**
Rather than treating causes as isolated factors, causal webs show how causes connect to and enable one another. Pupils draw arrows between causes to show relationships: "This led to..." "This made possible..." "This combined with..." Such diagrams make the structure of causal argument visible and support pupils in constructing more sophisticated explanations.

**The Bucket and Tap Metaphor**
Some teachers use the metaphor of a bucket filling with water to explain the relationship between long-term and short-term causes. The long-term causes (structural factors, underlying tensions) are the water filling the bucket; the short-term trigger is the final drop that causes the bucket to overflow. This metaphor helps pupils distinguish between underlying conditions and precipitating events.

**Counterfactual Reasoning (Chapman)**
Arthur Chapman has argued for the value of counterfactual reasoning — asking what might have happened if particular causes had been absent or different. This approach helps pupils understand the contingent nature of historical events and to weigh the relative importance of different causes by considering which were most decisive in producing the actual outcome.

### Card Sorts and Classification Activities

Card sorts are a staple activity for teaching causation. Pupils receive cards describing various factors and must sort them according to different criteria:
- Long-term versus short-term causes
- Economic, social, political, and religious causes
- Important versus less important causes

Christine Counsell has argued that such activities, when used regularly and over time, enable pupils to develop transferable understanding. The pupil who has sorted cards about the causes of the Industrial Revolution can apply similar thinking to the causes of the Russian Revolution — they have developed a mental model for approaching causation problems.

The key is ensuring that classification activities lead to explanation, not just categorisation. After sorting, pupils must be required to explain:
- Why they placed cards in particular categories
- How causes in different categories relate to one another
- Which causes were most significant and why

### Speaking and Listening Strategies

Vaughan Clark and others have demonstrated the value of speaking and listening activities in developing causal reasoning. Discussion allows pupils to try out ideas, hear alternative perspectives, and refine their thinking before committing to writing.

Effective strategies include:
- **Think-Pair-Share**: Pupils consider a causal question individually, discuss with a partner, then share with the class
- **Conscience Alley**: Pupils line up to represent different factors influencing a historical decision, each making their case
- **Hot-Seating**: A pupil plays a historical figure and is questioned about their motivations and decisions
- **Debate and Discussion**: Structured debate about which cause was most important requires pupils to justify and defend causal claims

The principle is that talk supports thinking. Pupils who can explain their causal reasoning orally are better positioned to write sophisticated causal arguments.

### Integrating Causation with Other Concepts

Causation does not exist in isolation. Effective teaching integrates causal thinking with other second-order concepts:

**Causation and Change**: Explaining why change occurred requires both understanding of what changed (continuity and change) and why (causation).

**Causation and Evidence**: Causal claims must be supported by evidence. Teaching pupils to base causal arguments on historical sources helps develop both concepts simultaneously.

**Causation and Interpretations**: Different historians may weight causes differently. Examining historiographical debates about causes helps pupils understand that causal explanation involves interpretation and selection.

**Causation and Significance**: Determining which causes were most significant requires the same kind of evaluative thinking involved in determining historical significance more broadly.

## Teaching Causation Across Key Stages

### Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS)

While the EYFS does not include history as a distinct subject, the "Understanding the World" area of learning provides foundations for later historical thinking. Young children can begin to develop precursor understandings that support later causal reasoning.

**Developmentally Appropriate Approaches**
Hilary Cooper's research on young children's thinking in history demonstrates that even young children can engage with causal questions when these are grounded in their immediate experience. Questions like "Why do we wear different clothes in winter?" or "Why do plants need water?" introduce the logic of explanation in accessible contexts.

**Story-Based Approaches**
Stories provide natural contexts for exploring cause and consequence. As children hear stories, they can discuss:
- Why characters acted as they did
- What might have happened if characters had made different choices
- How events in the story led to other events

Such discussions develop the habit of asking "why" questions and seeking explanations — foundational to later historical causation.

**Play and Exploration**
Through play, children experience cause and effect directly. Building a tower and watching it fall, mixing colours to create new colours, or planting seeds and watching them grow all provide concrete experiences of causation that can be referenced when teaching historical causation later.

### Key Stage 1 (Ages 5-7)

At Key Stage 1, pupils are introduced to formal history education. Causal reasoning at this stage should be simple, concrete, and closely tied to pupils' developing substantive knowledge.

**Simple Causal Questions**
Teachers should frame simple causal questions that pupils can answer based on their learning:
- "Why did the Great Fire of London spread so quickly?"
- "Why did Florence Nightingale go to the Crimea?"
- "Why did people build castles?"

These questions allow pupils to offer explanations based on their knowledge without requiring complex frameworks. Answers might reference single causes or simple combinations of factors.

**Common Misconceptions at KS1**
At this stage, pupils may:
- Attribute present-day motivations to historical figures
- Assume people in the past had the same knowledge we do
- Struggle to distinguish between causes and descriptions

Teachers should gently correct these misconceptions while validating pupils' efforts to explain.

**Practical Activities**
- **Picture sequences**: Arrange pictures showing events in order, then discuss what led from one to the next
- **Simple cause cards**: Provide cards with simple statements that pupils arrange to show why something happened
- **Role-play**: Act out scenarios that explore why people made particular choices

### Key Stage 2 (Ages 7-11)

Key Stage 2 represents a crucial period for developing causal understanding. Pupils are now capable of handling multiple causes and beginning to categorise and prioritise them.

**Introducing Multiple Causation**
By upper KS2, pupils should understand that historical events typically have multiple causes. The NC requirement that pupils "note connections, contrasts and trends over time" supports this development.

Teachers can introduce frameworks for organising multiple causes:
- **Long-term and short-term causes**: The distinction between underlying conditions and triggers
- **Categories of causes**: Economic, social, political, and religious factors
- **Chains of causation**: How one cause led to another in sequence

**The Battle of Hastings as a Causal Case Study**
The Battle of Hastings (1066) is frequently taught at KS2 and offers an excellent vehicle for developing causal thinking. Pupils can explore:
- Harold's army being tired from marching north then south
- Norman tactical advantages (archers, cavalry)
- William's leadership and determination
- The luck of Harold being hit by an arrow

A well-designed enquiry might ask: "Why did William win the Battle of Hastings?" This requires pupils to consider multiple factors and begin to weigh their relative importance.

**Common Misconceptions at KS2**
- **Single-cause thinking**: Persisting belief that one factor fully explains an event
- **Teleological thinking**: Assuming events were destined to happen
- **Present-mindedness**: Judging past decisions by modern standards
- **Confusion of categories**: Difficulty distinguishing between different types of causes

**Practical Activities**
- **Card sorts with increasing complexity**: Start with sorting causes into categories, progress to ranking by importance
- **Causal webs**: Drawing connections between different factors
- **Living graphs**: Plotting how different factors developed over time leading to an event
- **Written explanations with frames**: "One reason was... Another important factor was... However, the most significant cause was... because..."

### Key Stage 3 (Ages 11-14)

Key Stage 3 should build on KS2 foundations to develop more sophisticated causal reasoning. By the end of KS3, pupils should be capable of constructing structured causal arguments that weigh factors, consider contingency, and engage with historical debate.

**Sophisticated Causal Frameworks**
At KS3, pupils can handle more nuanced frameworks:
- **Necessary and sufficient conditions**: Understanding which causes were essential and which merely contributed
- **Structural versus contingent factors**: Distinguishing between underlying conditions and specific triggers
- **Intended and unintended consequences**: Recognising that actions may have effects that were not anticipated
- **Counterfactual reasoning**: Considering how events might have unfolded differently

**Constructing Causal Arguments**
KS3 pupils should be taught explicitly how to construct written causal arguments. This includes:
- Establishing the range of relevant causes
- Organising causes logically (chronologically, by category, or by significance)
- Prioritising causes with explicit reasoning
- Considering alternative viewpoints and counter-arguments

Gary Howells, writing in *Teaching History*, argues for being "ambitious with the causes of the First World War" — moving beyond simple lists to genuine causal reasoning that interrogates inevitability and explores the processes of explanation.

**Common Misconceptions at KS3**
- **Categorisation without analysis**: Listing causes by type without explaining significance
- **False balance**: Treating all causes as equally important to appear "fair"
- **Deterministic language**: Using phrases like "inevitably led to" or "was bound to happen"
- **Ignoring agency**: Focusing on abstract forces rather than human choices

**Practical Activities**
- **The Diamond Nine (Chapman)**: Prioritising causes through physical arrangement and justification
- **Counterfactual scenarios**: "What if the assassination had failed?" to test the significance of causes
- **Historiographical comparison**: Examining how different historians have weighted causes
- **Extended writing with analytical frameworks**: Teaching pupils to structure coherent causal arguments

## Assessment of Causal Understanding

### Assessing Progress in Causal Reasoning

Ofsted's research review notes that assessment in history should focus on the quality of pupils' historical thinking, not merely the quantity of information they can recall. When assessing causation, teachers should look for:

**Indicators of Developing Understanding**
- Recognition that events have multiple causes
- Ability to distinguish between types of causes (long-term/short-term, economic/political/social)
- Capacity to prioritise causes with supporting reasoning
- Use of appropriate causal language and connectives

**Indicators of Secure Understanding**
- Construction of structured causal arguments
- Awareness that historical explanation involves selection and interpretation
- Ability to engage with counter-arguments and alternative explanations
- Recognition of the contingent nature of historical events

### Formative Assessment Strategies

**Diagnostic Tasks**
Before teaching a causation topic, present pupils with a diagnostic task to reveal their current thinking. This might be a simple ranking activity or a brief written response to a causal question. The responses reveal misconceptions that need addressing and provide a baseline for measuring progress.

**Written Feedback**
When providing feedback on causal writing, focus on:
- The structure of the argument (is there a clear logic?)
- The quality of reasoning (does the pupil explain *why* causes matter?)
- The use of evidence (are claims supported by historical knowledge?)
- The sophistication of causal language

**Peer Assessment**
Having pupils assess each other's causal arguments using structured criteria can develop their understanding of what makes a good explanation. Criteria might include: "Have they considered multiple causes?" "Have they explained which causes were most important?" "Have they used evidence to support their claims?"

## Key Takeaways for Teachers

1. **Causation is explanation, not description** — Ensure pupils understand that explaining why requires different thinking from describing what happened.

2. **Build on secure substantive knowledge** — Pupils cannot construct causal arguments about events they do not understand in depth.

3. **Progression is qualitative, not just quantitative** — Developing causal understanding means restructuring how pupils think about explanation, not just learning more causes.

4. **Address misconceptions explicitly** — Telegraph thinking, single-cause explanations, and inevitability assumptions need direct challenge.

5. **Use frameworks to structure thinking** — Diamond nines, causal webs, and categorisation activities make thinking visible and support development.

6. **Integrate speaking and listening** — Discussion allows pupils to try out ideas before writing and develops their causal vocabulary.

7. **Frame effective enquiry questions** — Good questions require genuine reasoning, not just list-making.

8. **Teach the language of causation** — Explicitly teach and expect pupils to use causal connectives and constructions in their writing.

9. **Consider counterfactuals** — "What if?" questions help pupils understand contingency and weigh the significance of causes.

10. **Assess thinking, not just content** — Look for the quality of causal reasoning, not merely the quantity of causes mentioned.
