# Disciplinary Knowledge in History: An Overview

## Introduction

Disciplinary knowledge in history refers to pupils' understanding of how historians investigate the past, construct historical claims, and build arguments and accounts. It encompasses the methods, tools, and assumptions that underpin historical enquiry—the very processes through which historical knowledge is created, contested, and refined. This knowledge enables pupils to think critically about historical claims, understand the provisional nature of historical knowledge, and appreciate how accounts of the past are constructed rather than simply discovered.

The distinction between substantive knowledge (knowledge *of* the past—events, people, periods) and disciplinary knowledge (knowledge *of* how historians work) has become central to history curriculum design in England since Christine Counsell's influential 2018 work drawing on Schwab's distinction between 'syntactic' and 'substantive' knowledge. However, these categories are not separate domains but deeply intertwined: substantive knowledge becomes historical only when shaped by disciplinary approaches, while disciplinary knowledge gains meaning only when applied to specific historical contexts.

## Second-Order Concepts: The Framework of Historical Thinking

The National Curriculum identifies six key disciplinary concepts—often called 'second-order concepts'—that provide the framework through which pupils engage with historical content. These concepts, which emerged from the Schools Council History Project (SCHP) work of the 1970s and were refined through decades of classroom research, give teachers and pupils a shared language for thinking historically.

### Change and Continuity

Understanding change and continuity requires pupils to identify what altered and what remained stable over time, and to make judgements about the pace, extent, and nature of change. This is not merely about noting differences between 'before' and 'after' but involves sophisticated reasoning about:

- **The measurement of change**: Against what baseline is change assessed?
- **The pace of change**: Was transformation sudden or gradual, revolutionary or evolutionary?
- **The nature of change**: Did change affect all aspects of society equally, or were there continuities alongside apparent transformations?
- **Causal complexity**: Were changes driven by internal dynamics or external forces?

As Christine Counsell notes, teaching change and continuity should make pupils 'curious about the temporal quality of human experience in the past.' This means moving beyond binary 'change vs. continuity' exercises toward understanding the textured, uneven nature of historical transformation.

### Cause and Consequence

Historical causation involves understanding why events occurred and what followed from them. Unlike simple 'trigger' models, historical causation is characterised by:

- **Multiple causation**: Events typically result from the convergence of multiple factors operating at different scales
- **Levels of causation**: Distinguishing between long-term structural causes, medium-term preconditions, and short-term triggers
- **Intended and unintended consequences**: Recognising that actors' intentions rarely match outcomes
- **Causal hierarchy**: Determining which factors were necessary, sufficient, or merely contributory

Teaching causation effectively requires careful sequencing—pupils need secure substantive knowledge of contexts before they can construct sophisticated causal arguments. Generic 'cause and consequence' exercises without this grounding risk producing formulaic thinking.

### Similarity and Difference

This concept involves comparing past societies, events, or periods to identify what they shared and where they diverged. It requires pupils to:

- **Avoid presentism**: Not measuring the past against modern standards
- **Identify appropriate bases for comparison**: Selecting meaningful criteria rather than arbitrary points
- **Recognise diversity within categories**: Understanding that 'the Romans' or 'medieval peasants' were not homogeneous groups
- **Appreciate historical specificity**: Understanding how context shapes difference and similarity

The concept is closely linked to understanding historical empathy—recognising that people in the past held different beliefs, values, and assumptions, and that these differences are not simply 'errors' to be corrected but frameworks to be understood.

### Significance

Historical significance is not an inherent quality of events or people but a judgement made by historians about importance. Pupils learning to evaluate significance must consider:

- **Contemporary versus retrospective significance**: How was something viewed at the time versus how it is judged subsequently?
- **Different criteria for significance**: Profundity (depth of impact), quantity (number affected), durability (lasting consequences), relevance (to present concerns), and resonance (in collective memory)
- **Changing significance**: How assessments of importance shift across time and between different groups
- **Silences in the record**: Whose significance has been overlooked or suppressed?

Teaching significance offers opportunities to address diversity in the curriculum, as pupils investigate why certain groups and individuals have been marginalised in historical narratives.

### Evidence and Sources

Understanding how historical knowledge is constructed from sources is foundational to disciplinary thinking. This involves:

- **Source analysis**: Identifying what sources can and cannot reveal, considering authorship, purpose, audience, and context
- **Corroboration**: Using multiple sources to build confidence in claims
- **Evaluation of reliability and utility**: Understanding that reliability depends on the question being asked
- **Gaps in the record**: Recognising that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence
- **The constructed nature of archives**: Understanding how what survives shapes what can be known

Wineburg's research demonstrates that historical source work is 'very far from pupils' everyday modes of thinking.' Pupils often approach sources as 'fact-finding' exercises, looking for 'the answer' rather than engaging with the complex process of constructing claims from fragmentary, partial evidence.

### Historical Interpretations

Pupils must understand that historical accounts are constructions, not neutral transmissions of 'what happened.' This involves:

- **Understanding historiographical debate**: Recognising that historians disagree and that these disagreements are productive
- **Identifying what shapes interpretations**: How historians' contexts, questions, and methods influence their conclusions
- **Evaluating interpretations**: Assessing the evidence and reasoning underpinning different accounts
- **Constructing arguments**: Building their own reasoned interpretations based on evidence

The Ofsted research review emphasises that 'genuine academic debates in history' should inform enquiry questions, exposing pupils to the contested nature of historical knowledge.

## The Relationship Between Substantive and Disciplinary Knowledge

The interaction between substantive and disciplinary knowledge is complex and bidirectional. As the Ofsted research review states, 'deploying both substantive and disciplinary knowledge in combination is what gives pupils the capacity or skill to construct historical arguments or analyse sources.'

### Substantive Knowledge Enables Disciplinary Thinking

Pupils cannot analyse sources or construct arguments about periods they know nothing about. Secure 'fingertip knowledge'—detailed, readily accessible knowledge of specific contexts—reduces demands on working memory and enables higher-order thinking. Kate Hammond's research shows that the range and security of pupils' knowledge directly impacts the quality of their historical arguments.

### Disciplinary Knowledge Shapes Substantive Understanding

Equally, substantive knowledge only becomes historical when shaped by disciplinary approaches. A pupil might know 'what happened' in 1066, but without understanding causation, evidence, and interpretation, this knowledge remains inert information rather than historical understanding.

### The Hermeneutic Circle

Christine Counsell describes this relationship using the hermeneutic circle—the interplay between part and whole. Pupils understand particular events by placing them in broader contexts (chronological frameworks, conceptual understanding), while these broader frameworks are themselves constructed from particular instances. Neither can be fully grasped without the other.

## Progression in Disciplinary Knowledge

### Key Stage 1 (Ages 5–7)

At this stage, the foundations for disciplinary thinking are laid through:

- **Developing awareness of 'the past'**: Understanding that life was different before pupils were born
- **Simple sequencing**: Ordering events chronologically
- **Introduction to sources**: Beginning to distinguish between present-day observations and accounts from the past
- **Story and account**: Understanding that stories about the past come from different sources

The emphasis should be on curiosity and engagement rather than formal analysis. Pupils' everyday understanding of time, change, and evidence provides the starting point.

### Key Stage 2 (Ages 7–11)

Pupils develop more explicit disciplinary understanding:

- **Explicit introduction to second-order concepts**: Change, cause, similarity/difference, and significance become the focus of specific enquiries
- **Source work**: Moving from simple 'what does this tell us?' to considering reliability and utility
- **Multiple perspectives**: Understanding that different people experienced the same events differently
- **Evidence and inference**: Beginning to make inferences from sources and understand the distinction between evidence and interpretation

Teaching should provide carefully structured opportunities to engage with disciplinary thinking, always grounded in secure substantive knowledge of specific contexts.

### Key Stage 3 (Ages 11–14)

Disciplinary knowledge becomes more sophisticated:

- **Complex causation**: Moving beyond simple cause-and-effect to multi-causal explanations with consideration of interaction between factors
- **Interpretations**: Explicit engagement with how and why historians disagree, including consideration of historiographical context
- **Evaluation of evidence**: More nuanced analysis of source utility and reliability, including consideration of silences and gaps
- **Argument construction**: Building sustained historical arguments that deploy evidence and engage with alternative interpretations

The National Curriculum requires pupils to 'understand how different types of historical sources are used rigorously to make historical claims' and to 'discern how and why contrasting arguments and interpretations of the past have been constructed.'

### GCSE and A-Level (Ages 14–18)

At these stages, disciplinary knowledge is assessed through examination criteria:

- **AO1 (Knowledge)**: Demonstrating knowledge and understanding of the past
- **AO2 (Causation and consequence)**: Explaining and analysing historical events and periods
- **AO3 (Sources)**: Analysing and evaluating sources
- **AO4 (Interpretations)**: Analysing and evaluating interpretations

Assessment objectives explicitly require the integration of substantive and disciplinary knowledge. Pupils cannot achieve high grades through either alone.

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Enquiry Questions

Effective teaching of disciplinary knowledge is organised around enquiry questions that reflect genuine historical problems. The Ofsted review notes that 'the careful crafting of enquiry questions is a complex process and requires extensive historical and pedagogical knowledge.' Good enquiry questions:

- Are genuinely open and contested (not leading questions with predetermined answers)
- Require integration of substantive and disciplinary knowledge
- Reflect authentic historical problems rather than pseudo-debates
- Provide appropriate challenge while remaining accessible

### Using Scholarship

Bringing academic historical work into the classroom supports disciplinary understanding:

- **Exposing pupils to historiographical debate**: Showing that historians disagree and why
- **Modelling disciplinary thinking**: Using historians' work to demonstrate how claims are constructed
- **Broadening perspectives**: Introducing voices and approaches beyond the textbook

### Careful Sequencing

Disciplinary knowledge must be carefully sequenced:

- **Substantive before disciplinary**: Pupils need secure knowledge of contexts before they can analyse them historically
- **Concrete before abstract**: Specific examples before general principles
- **Supported before independent**: Scaffolded practice before independent application

### Avoiding Misconceptions

Research identifies common misconceptions that teaching must address:

- **'The past is fixed'**: Pupils often believe there is a single 'true' account waiting to be discovered
- **Sources as facts**: Viewing sources as direct windows to the past rather than constructed accounts
- **Presentism**: Judging past actors by modern standards
- **Teleology**: Viewing the past as inevitably leading to the present
- **Over-simplification**: Reducing complex causation to single factors

## Assessment of Disciplinary Knowledge

### Formative Assessment

Ongoing assessment should focus on pupils' developing disciplinary thinking:

- **Diagnostic tasks**: Identifying misconceptions early
- **Low-stakes writing**: Regular opportunities to construct arguments
- **Discussion and dialogue**: Using talk to make thinking visible
- **Feedback on process**: Commenting on how pupils reached conclusions, not just whether conclusions are 'correct'

### Summative Assessment

Formal assessment must genuinely assess disciplinary thinking:

- **Avoiding genericism**: Tasks should require application of disciplinary knowledge to specific contexts
- **Integrating knowledge**: Assessment should require deployment of both substantive and disciplinary knowledge
- **Evaluating arguments**: Tasks should require evaluation of historical claims and interpretations

The Ofsted review warns against 'drilling pupils in appropriate wording to meet examination requirements' without developing underlying foundations. Assessment that rewards formulaic responses over genuine understanding undermines disciplinary learning.

## Challenges and Tensions

### Coverage vs. Depth

There is a tension between covering required content and developing disciplinary thinking in depth. Research suggests that deep exploration of fewer topics often develops stronger disciplinary understanding than superficial coverage of many topics.

### Generic vs. Specific

There is a risk of teaching 'historical skills' as generic competencies detached from specific historical content. Counsell argues that such 'genericism' is both redundant and inadequate—disciplinary knowledge only functions when applied to specific contexts.

### Accessibility vs. Rigor

Making disciplinary knowledge accessible to all pupils while maintaining intellectual rigour is challenging. This requires careful scaffolding, explicit teaching of vocabulary and concepts, and recognition that disciplinary thinking is demanding and requires sustained effort.

### Assessment Pressure

Examination requirements can distort disciplinary teaching, encouraging formulaic approaches that prioritise exam technique over genuine understanding. Teachers must navigate between preparing pupils for assessments and developing authentic disciplinary thinking.

## Conclusion

Disciplinary knowledge is at the heart of history education. It transforms inert information about the past into living historical understanding, enabling pupils to think critically, construct reasoned arguments, and appreciate the provisional, contested nature of historical knowledge. Teaching disciplinary knowledge effectively requires careful integration with substantive content, explicit attention to second-order concepts, and recognition of the demanding, counter-intuitive nature of historical thinking. As pupils develop disciplinary understanding, they gain not just knowledge of the past but the capacity to engage critically with claims about the past—a capability that extends far beyond the history classroom.

The six second-order concepts—change and continuity, cause and consequence, similarity and difference, significance, evidence and sources, and historical interpretations—provide a framework for this teaching. However, they are not checklist items to be 'covered' but interconnected dimensions of historical thinking that gain meaning only through their application to rich, specific historical content. Effective history teaching weaves these concepts throughout the curriculum, supporting pupils to develop increasingly sophisticated understanding as they progress through their education.
