# Historical Interpretations: Teaching Pupils to Understand How and Why the Past is Reconstructed

## Introduction

Historical interpretations represent one of the most sophisticated and challenging second-order concepts in history education. While concepts such as causation, change, and evidence deal with how historians investigate and explain the past, interpretations concern how and why the past is constructed, contested, and reconstructed over time. Understanding that history is not simply 'what happened' but an ongoing dialogue between historians, shaped by questions, contexts, and perspectives, is fundamental to developing historical literacy.

The National Curriculum for history at Key Stage 3 requires pupils to "understand how different types of historical sources are used rigorously to make historical claims and discern how and why contrasting arguments and interpretations of the past have been constructed." This requirement reflects a recognition that historical knowledge is provisional, contested, and shaped by the questions historians ask and the contexts within which they work.

This document provides a comprehensive guide to teaching historical interpretations across the primary and secondary phases. It draws on the seminal work of the CHATA (Concepts of History and Teaching Approaches) project led by Peter Lee and Denis Shemilt, the pedagogical frameworks developed by Christine Counsell and Michael Riley, and recent Ofsted research reviews on history education.

## What Are Historical Interpretations?

### Defining the Concept

Historical interpretations are the various ways in which the past has been reconstructed, represented, and understood. They encompass written histories, museum displays, historical films, commemorative events, school textbooks, and even the stories we tell about the past in everyday conversation. The concept of interpretations is distinct from, though related to, the concepts of evidence and accounts.

Christine Counsell and her colleagues (in work developed from the 2004 Ofsted History Conference) identified several dimensions of historical interpretations:

**Interpretations as Products of Enquiry:**
Every historical interpretation is the product of a historian's enquiry, shaped by the questions they asked, the sources they consulted, and the methods they employed. Understanding this helps pupils see that interpretations are not arbitrary but are grounded in evidence and reasoning.

**Interpretations as Contextual Products:**
Interpretations are shaped by the context in which they are produced. The values, concerns, and circumstances of the interpreter influence how they understand and represent the past. A historian writing during the Cold War may interpret the origins of the First World War differently from one writing after the fall of the Soviet Union.

**Interpretations as Arguments:**
Historical interpretations are arguments that make claims about the past, supported by evidence and reasoning. They can be evaluated not just by whether they are 'true' or 'false' but by the quality of their argumentation, the evidence they marshal, and the reasoning they employ.

**Interpretations as Debates:**
The history of any topic is typically characterised by debate and disagreement between historians. Understanding that different interpretations exist and why historians disagree is central to historical literacy.

### The Relationship to Other Second-Order Concepts

Historical interpretations are superordinate to other second-order concepts. As Denis Shemilt argued, the failure to distinguish accounts from the concepts of source and evidence was "a major sin of omission" in early work on historical thinking. Interpretations encompass:

- **Evidence:** How historians use sources to construct claims
- **Accounts:** How narratives of the past are constructed
- **Causation, change, significance:** How historians explain and evaluate the past

Understanding interpretations requires pupils to bring together their knowledge of all these concepts, recognising that historical knowledge is constructed through a complex process of enquiry, reasoning, and representation.

## Progression in Understanding Historical Interpretations

### The CHATA Research on Pupils' Ideas

The CHATA project mapped how pupils' understanding of historical interpretations develops between the ages of seven and fourteen. Their research revealed a progression in pupils' ideas, though they emphasised that progression is not linear—pupils may demonstrate sophisticated thinking in some contexts while reverting to naïve ideas in others.

**Level 1: The Past as Fixed and Given**
At the earliest stage, many pupils see the past as fixed and given. They believe that history is simply 'what happened' and that there is one true story of the past waiting to be discovered. When presented with different accounts, they may assume that one is right and the others are wrong, or they may see differences as arising from error or incomplete knowledge.

Typical pupil responses at this level include:
- "They just got it wrong"
- "They didn't know all the facts"
- "We need to find out what really happened"

**Level 2: The Past as Partially Known**
As pupils develop, they begin to recognise that our knowledge of the past is partial and that different accounts may reflect different access to evidence. They may see historians as detectives who piece together the past from surviving clues, with disagreements arising from gaps in the evidence.

**Level 3: Interpretations as Products of Enquiry**
More sophisticated pupils recognise that interpretations are shaped by the questions historians ask and the approaches they take. They understand that different historians may focus on different aspects of the past or ask different questions, leading to different accounts.

**Level 4: Interpretations as Contextually Shaped**
At this level, pupils recognise that interpretations are shaped by the context in which they are produced. They understand that historians bring their own perspectives, values, and concerns to their work, and that these influence how they interpret the past. They may begin to see connections between interpretations and the contexts of their production.

**Level 5: Interpretations as Arguments**
The most sophisticated pupils see interpretations as arguments that make claims about the past, supported by evidence and reasoning. They can evaluate interpretations not just by checking facts but by assessing the quality of argumentation, the use of evidence, and the reasoning employed. They understand that historical knowledge is provisional and subject to revision.

### Implications for Teaching

The CHATA research has profound implications for teaching historical interpretations:

**Start Early:**
Even young children can begin to develop ideas about interpretations. The Oak National Academy curriculum uses traditional stories in Key Stage 1 to introduce pupils to their first interpretations of the past, recognising that stories are interpretations, not neutral accounts.

**Work with Pupils' Ideas:**
Teachers need to identify pupils' existing ideas about interpretations and work with them, helping pupils to develop more sophisticated understanding over time. This requires diagnostic questioning and attention to pupils' reasoning.

**Provide Appropriate Challenges:**
Pupils need to encounter interpretations that challenge their current thinking. If pupils see the past as fixed and given, they need to encounter cases where historians disagree in ways that cannot be resolved simply by checking facts.

**Make Progression Explicit:**
Pupils benefit from understanding how their thinking about interpretations is developing. Making the dimensions of progression explicit helps pupils to monitor and advance their own understanding.

## Teaching Historical Interpretations in the Primary Phase

### Early Years Foundation Stage

While the EYFS does not explicitly require teaching about historical interpretations, the foundations can be laid through stories and discussions about the past. Practitioners can:

**Use Stories as Interpretations:**
Stories about the past, whether traditional tales or historical narratives, can be discussed as interpretations. Questions like "Who wrote this story?" and "Why do you think they told it this way?" begin to develop awareness that accounts of the past are constructed.

**Discuss Different Accounts:**
When children encounter different versions of the same story or event, practitioners can discuss how and why they differ. This might include different family members' accounts of the same event or different books' versions of a historical story.

**Value Children's Own Accounts:**
Children's own accounts of events can be used to develop understanding of how different people may remember and represent the same events differently.

### Key Stage 1

At Key Stage 1, pupils should begin to recognise that the past can be represented in different ways. Teaching strategies include:

**Introduce Simple Interpretations:**
Use traditional stories, picture books, and simple historical narratives to introduce the idea that the past can be represented in different ways. The Oak National Academy curriculum suggests using traditional stories in Key Stage 1 to introduce pupils to their first interpretations.

**Compare Different Accounts:**
Provide opportunities to compare different accounts of the same person or event. For example, pupils might compare how different books represent the same historical figure or how different family members describe the same event.

**Discuss 'How Do We Know?':**
Encourage pupils to think about how we know about the past and why different people might tell different stories. This can be linked to the concept of evidence, helping pupils see that accounts are based on sources.

**Use Concrete Examples:**
Work with concrete, accessible examples. Young children may struggle with abstract discussions about 'interpretation' but can engage with specific cases where accounts differ.

### Key Stage 2

At Key Stage 2, pupils should develop their understanding of how and why interpretations differ. The National Curriculum requires pupils to "understand how our knowledge of the past is constructed from a range of sources." Teaching strategies include:

**Study Specific Interpretations:**
The Oak National Academy curriculum includes studying why people have argued about the Benin Bronzes, providing a concrete example of how interpretations of the same artefacts can differ and change over time.

**Analyse Representation:**
Help pupils analyse how the past is represented in different media. This might include comparing how a museum display, a textbook, and a website represent the same historical period.

**Discuss Why Interpretations Change:**
Provide examples of how interpretations have changed over time. For example, how have views of the Vikings changed from the Victorians to the present day?

**Link to Evidence:**
Develop pupils' understanding of how interpretations are based on evidence. Help them see that historians use sources to construct accounts, and that different historians may use different sources or interpret the same sources differently.

**Introduce the Role of the Historian:**
Begin to develop pupils' understanding that interpretations are constructed by historians who ask questions and make choices. This can be linked to the idea that the questions we ask shape the answers we find.

## Teaching Historical Interpretations at Key Stage 3

### The National Curriculum Requirements

The Key Stage 3 National Curriculum requires pupils to:
- "Understand how different types of historical sources are used rigorously to make historical claims"
- "Discern how and why contrasting arguments and interpretations of the past have been constructed"

These requirements build on the foundations laid at primary level and prepare pupils for the more sophisticated engagement with interpretations required at GCSE and A Level.

### Developing Pupils' Understanding

**Analysing Interpretations as Arguments:**
At Key Stage 3, pupils should begin to analyse interpretations as arguments that make claims, supported by evidence and reasoning. This involves:
- Identifying the claims an interpretation makes
- Recognising the evidence used to support those claims
- Evaluating the reasoning that connects evidence to claims

**Understanding Contextual Factors:**
Pupils should develop understanding of how interpretations are shaped by their contexts of production. This includes:
- The questions and concerns of the time when the interpretation was produced
- The values and assumptions of the interpreter
- The available evidence and methods

**Engaging with Historical Debate:**
Pupils should encounter cases where historians disagree and develop understanding of why they disagree. This might involve:
- Different emphases or focuses
- Different uses of the same evidence
- Different underlying assumptions or values

**Evaluating Interpretations:**
Pupils should begin to evaluate interpretations, considering:
- The evidence used and how it is interpreted
- The reasoning employed
- The contextual factors that may have shaped the interpretation
- The relationship to other interpretations

### Practical Teaching Strategies

**Interpretations-Focused Enquiries:**
Michael Riley and colleagues developed the idea of interpretations-focused enquiries, where the enquiry question directly addresses how and why interpretations differ. For example:
- "Why have historians disagreed about the causes of the First World War?"
- "How and why have interpretations of the British Empire changed over time?"

**Using Diverse Interpretations:**
Provide pupils with a range of interpretations, including:
- Academic histories written at different times
- Popular representations (films, books, museums)
- Contemporaneous accounts and later reconstructions
- Different national perspectives

**The 'Interpretations Table':**
Counsell, Riley, and Byrom developed a framework for analysing interpretations that can be used in the classroom. This involves identifying:
- What is being claimed
- What evidence is used
- What reasoning is employed
- What contextual factors may be relevant

**Developing Metacognitive Awareness:**
Help pupils become aware of their own thinking about interpretations. Encourage them to reflect on:
- What they initially thought about an interpretation
- How their thinking changed
- What caused their thinking to change

## Teaching Historical Interpretations at GCSE and A Level

### GCSE Requirements

GCSE history specifications require pupils to engage with historical interpretations as part of their assessment. Typically, this involves:
- Analysing and evaluating interpretations
- Understanding why interpretations differ
- Assessing the validity of interpretations

Teaching at this level should build on the foundations laid at Key Stage 3, developing more sophisticated understanding and analysis.

### A Level Requirements

At A Level, pupils are expected to engage with historical interpretations in greater depth, including:
- Understanding how historical debates have developed over time
- Analysing the methodology and approach of different historians
- Evaluating interpretations in the context of broader historiographical developments

Arthur Chapman's work on historical argument and extended writing is particularly relevant here, as A Level pupils need to construct their own arguments about interpretations.

## Common Misconceptions and How to Address Them

### Misconception 1: 'The Truth' View

**The Misconception:**
Many pupils believe that there is one true account of the past and that disagreements between historians can be resolved simply by finding out 'what really happened.'

**Addressing It:**
Provide pupils with cases where historians agree on the facts but disagree on interpretation. For example, historians may agree on what the Versailles Treaty contained but disagree on whether it was fair or wise. Help pupils see that interpretation goes beyond establishing facts.

### Misconception 2: The 'Bias' View

**The Misconception:**
Pupils may see differences in interpretation simply as bias—some historians are biased while others tell the truth. This binary view fails to recognise that all interpretations are shaped by perspective and context.

**Addressing It:**
Discuss how all historians bring perspectives and values to their work. Rather than labelling some accounts as 'biased' and others as 'objective,' help pupils analyse how different perspectives shape interpretation and how historians work to produce rigorous, evidence-based accounts while acknowledging their own positioning.

### Misconception 3: The 'Presentism' View

**The Misconception:**
Pupils may judge past interpretations by present-day values without understanding the contexts in which they were produced.

**Addressing It:**
Teach pupils to consider the context of interpretation production. Help them understand why a historian in the 1950s might have interpreted the British Empire differently from a historian today, without simply dismissing the earlier interpretation as 'wrong.'

### Misconception 4: The 'All Equally Valid' View

**The Misconception:**
Some pupils, recognising that interpretations differ, may conclude that all interpretations are equally valid and that there is no basis for preferring one over another.

**Addressing It:**
Develop pupils' ability to evaluate interpretations based on evidence, reasoning, and methodology. Help them see that while multiple interpretations may be valid, they are not all equally well-supported or persuasive.

## Assessment of Historical Interpretations

### Formative Assessment Strategies

**Diagnostic Questions:**
Use questions that reveal pupils' thinking about interpretations. For example:
- "Why do these two historians disagree about X?"
- "What might have influenced this historian's interpretation?"
- "How would you evaluate this interpretation?"

**Written Tasks:**
Include regular written tasks that require pupils to engage with interpretations. These might range from simple comparisons at Key Stage 2 to sophisticated evaluations at GCSE and A Level.

**Discussion and Dialogue:**
Use classroom discussion to assess and develop understanding. Socratic questioning can probe pupils' thinking and help them develop more sophisticated ideas.

### Summative Assessment

At Key Stage 3 and beyond, summative assessment should require pupils to:
- Analyse and compare interpretations
- Explain why interpretations differ
- Evaluate interpretations using appropriate criteria

GCSE and A Level examinations include specific questions on historical interpretations that assess these capacities.

## The Role of Resources and Organisations

### The Historical Association

The Historical Association provides extensive resources for teaching historical interpretations, including:
- Teaching History articles on interpretations
- Guidance on progression in disciplinary knowledge
- Professional development on teaching interpretations

### Oak National Academy

The Oak National Academy history curriculum includes interpretations-focused enquiries at all key stages, with careful attention to progression. Their materials provide models for how to structure teaching about interpretations.

### Ofsted Guidance

The Ofsted research review series on history (2021) and subsequent subject reports emphasise the importance of teaching disciplinary knowledge, including interpretations. The reviews note that this is an area where practice is often weaker and provide guidance on effective teaching.

## Practical Classroom Activities

### Activity 1: Interpretations Over Time

**Purpose:**
To help pupils understand how interpretations change over time.

**Procedure:**
1. Select a historical topic with clearly changing interpretations (e.g., the British Empire, the Vikings, Richard III).
2. Provide pupils with representations from different periods (Victorian, mid-20th century, contemporary).
3. Ask pupils to identify differences and suggest reasons for them.
4. Discuss how changing values, new evidence, and different questions have shaped interpretations.

### Activity 2: Why Do Historians Disagree?

**Purpose:**
To help pupils understand reasons for disagreement between historians.

**Procedure:**
1. Provide pupils with two or more interpretations of the same event that disagree.
2. Guide pupils to identify specific points of disagreement.
3. Help pupils analyse possible reasons for disagreement (different evidence, different questions, different values, different contexts of production).
4. Discuss whether the disagreement can be resolved and how.

### Activity 3: Evaluating Interpretations

**Purpose:**
To develop pupils' capacity to evaluate interpretations.

**Procedure:**
1. Provide pupils with an interpretation and some relevant source material.
2. Ask pupils to assess how well the interpretation is supported by the evidence.
3. Ask pupils to identify any evidence that might challenge the interpretation.
4. Discuss the strengths and limitations of the interpretation.

### Activity 4: Writing Interpretations

**Purpose:**
To help pupils understand how interpretations are constructed by constructing their own.

**Procedure:**
1. Provide pupils with a set of sources on a historical topic.
2. Ask pupils to construct their own interpretation, using the sources as evidence.
3. Have pupils share their interpretations and discuss why they differ.
4. Reflect on how the questions pupils asked and the sources they selected shaped their interpretations.

## Conclusion

Teaching historical interpretations is challenging but essential. It requires pupils to understand that history is not simply a fixed body of knowledge but an ongoing process of enquiry and debate. By developing pupils' understanding of how and why interpretations differ, teachers help them become critical consumers and producers of historical knowledge.

Effective teaching of historical interpretations requires:
- Clear understanding of the concept and its relationship to other second-order concepts
- Attention to progression, building from early awareness in the primary phase to sophisticated analysis at GCSE and A Level
- A repertoire of teaching strategies, including interpretations-focused enquiries, analysis of diverse representations, and opportunities for pupils to construct their own interpretations
- Awareness of common misconceptions and how to address them
- Regular opportunities for assessment, both formative and summative

By teaching historical interpretations effectively, we prepare pupils not just to succeed in examinations but to engage critically with the many representations of the past they encounter throughout their lives.
