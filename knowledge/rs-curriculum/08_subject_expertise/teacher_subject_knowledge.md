# Teacher Subject Knowledge in Religious Studies

## Introduction

Teacher subject knowledge in Religious Studies (RS) represents one of the most complex and contested areas of professional expertise in the teaching profession. Unlike subjects with a more clearly defined disciplinary boundary, RS demands that teachers navigate multiple knowledge domains: theological and philosophical content from diverse religious and non-religious traditions, pedagogical approaches sensitive to the subject's unique contribution to education, and the delicate interpersonal skills required to facilitate discussion of existential and ethical questions in pluralistic classrooms.

This knowledge file examines the research base underpinning teacher subject knowledge in RS, identifies common misconceptions held by both teachers and pupils, explores frameworks for developing expertise, and analyses the critical relationship between teacher knowledge and pupil understanding. The content draws upon Ofsted research, professional body guidance from the National Association of Teachers of Religious Education (NATRE) and the Religious Education Council (REC), and academic studies of teacher expertise in controversial and sensitive subject areas.

## The Research Base: What Constitutes Subject Knowledge in RS?

### Lee Shulman's Knowledge Categories Applied to RS

Lee Shulman's seminal framework for understanding teacher knowledge provides a valuable lens through which to examine RS expertise. Shulman distinguished between:

**Content Knowledge (CK)** – The actual subject matter to be taught. In RS, this extends far beyond simple factual recall of religious beliefs and practices. Teachers require deep substantive knowledge of multiple religious traditions, philosophical frameworks, and ethical systems. However, RS content knowledge is uniquely complicated by the contested nature of its boundaries. Unlike mathematics or science, where disciplinary consensus exists around core concepts, RS encompasses both theological claims made within traditions and critical, academic study of those traditions. Teachers must possess sufficient depth to represent traditions authentically while maintaining the analytical distance required by academic study.

**Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK)** – The special amalgam of content and pedagogy unique to teaching particular topics. This represents the core of teaching expertise. In RS, PCK includes knowing the most powerful analogies, illustrations, examples, explanations, and demonstrations for making religious concepts accessible. It encompasses understanding which aspects of religious practice are most likely to generate pupil misconceptions, and which pedagogical approaches best address these. For example, effective RS teachers know that pupils often conflate religious identity with ethnic or cultural identity, and they possess specific strategies for helping pupils distinguish these categories.

**Curriculum Knowledge** – Understanding the breadth of materials and programmes available for teaching particular topics. In RS, this includes familiarity with the locally agreed syllabus or academy trust's religion and worldviews curriculum, examination specifications for GCSE and A Level, and the diverse resource materials produced by organisations such as RE Today, the Stapleford Centre, and individual religious communities.

### The Distinctive Nature of RS Subject Knowledge

Research by Kate Christopher and others at the University of Oxford has identified that RS subject knowledge differs qualitatively from many other curriculum areas. Teachers must simultaneously hold:

**Substantive Knowledge** – Accurate understanding of religious beliefs, practices, texts, and traditions. This includes knowing, for example, the Five Pillars of Islam, the significance of the Eucharist in Christianity, or the concept of Dharma in Hindu traditions. Substantive knowledge must be accurate, appropriately nuanced, and representative of how believers themselves understand their traditions.

**Disciplinary Knowledge** – Understanding how knowledge in RS is constructed, contested, and evaluated. This includes familiarity with theological, philosophical, phenomenological, and ethnographic approaches to studying religion. Teachers must understand that different questions require different methodological approaches, and that religious claims are evaluated differently depending on whether one adopts an insider (theological) or outsider (sociological) perspective.

**Personal Knowledge** – Awareness of one's own positionality in relation to religious and non-religious worldviews. Research consistently demonstrates that teachers' own beliefs (whether religious or not) influence their teaching, often unconsciously. Expert RS teachers possess reflective awareness of their own worldview commitments and how these might influence their representation of different traditions.

### Ofsted Findings on Teacher Knowledge

The Ofsted research review for Religious Education (2021) emphasised that "the quality of RE teaching is heavily dependent on teachers' subject knowledge." The review identified several critical findings:

Teachers with strong subject knowledge are better able to make connections between different topics and traditions, helping pupils develop coherent mental models of the subject. They are more confident in addressing pupil questions, including those that challenge religious claims or express scepticism. They are better equipped to select and adapt resources appropriately, recognising when materials present outdated, inaccurate, or unrepresentative accounts of religious traditions.

Conversely, the review noted that gaps in subject knowledge frequently result in over-reliance on published schemes of work, superficial treatment of complex concepts, and missed opportunities to develop pupils' critical thinking. When teachers lack confidence in their own knowledge, they tend to restrict classroom discussion to safe, factual terrain, avoiding the open exploration of meaning and significance that characterises high-quality RS.

## Common Misconceptions in Religious Studies

### Misconceptions Held by Teachers

Research and inspection evidence reveal several recurring misconceptions among RS teachers, particularly those without specialist training:

**The "World Religions" Paradigm** – Many teachers operate within an outdated framework that presents religions as discrete, bounded systems with clear memberships and uniform beliefs. This approach, critiqued by scholars such as Robert Jackson and the Warwick Religions and Education Research Unit, fails to account for the diversity within traditions, the fluid boundaries between religious and cultural practices, and the reality of multiple religious belonging. Teachers holding this misconception may present Christianity as identical to Western European Protestantism, or Islam as culturally homogeneous, thereby misrepresenting the lived reality of religious communities.

**The Conflation of Religious Education and Religious Instruction** – Some teachers, particularly those from faith backgrounds, approach RS as an opportunity to promote religious belief or particular moral positions. While faith-based schools operate within specific legal frameworks, community schools and academies must maintain educational neutrality regarding the truth claims of religions. Teachers who confuse education about religion with education in religion may inadvertently prioritise nurturing faith over developing critical understanding.

**The Assumption that RS Lacks Intellectual Rigor** – A persistent misconception, often reflecting wider societal attitudes, holds that RS is inherently less demanding than subjects such as science or mathematics. This manifests in teachers accepting superficial engagement, avoiding challenging philosophical questions, or treating RS primarily as a forum for personal opinion rather than disciplined inquiry. Such approaches fundamentally misrepresent the cognitive demands of high-quality RS, which requires sophisticated skills in interpretation, evaluation, and argumentation.

**The Belief that Neutrality Requires Silence about One's Own Views** – Some teachers assume that professional practice requires complete concealment of their own worldview positions. While indoctrination is clearly inappropriate, research by Felderhof, Francis, and others suggests that appropriate disclosure—where teachers model how personal commitments can be held whilst respecting alternative perspectives—can enhance rather than undermine educational quality. The misconception lies in equating all teacher disclosure with improper influence.

### Misconceptions Held by Pupils

Understanding common pupil misconceptions is essential for effective pedagogy. Research by the Bible Society, the Farmington Institute, and various academic studies has documented recurring patterns:

**Essentialisation** – Pupils frequently attribute fixed, unchanging characteristics to religious traditions, failing to recognise internal diversity, historical development, and contextual variation. For example, pupils may assume all Muslims practise identical forms of prayer, or that Christian beliefs about creation have remained unchanged since biblical times.

**The Confusion of Religious, Cultural, and Ethnic Identity** – Particularly in diverse classrooms, pupils often conflate religious affiliation with ethnic background or cultural practice. This can lead to stereotyping where religious identity is seen as determining behaviour, dress, or opinion. It may also result in pupils from religious backgrounds feeling positioned as representatives of their traditions, expected to speak for all adherents.

**The Assumption that Religious Texts are Read Literally** – Many pupils enter RS classrooms assuming that sacred texts function as straightforward instruction manuals, with believers applying literal interpretations uniformly. They may be unaware of the complex hermeneutical traditions within religions, the diversity of interpretive approaches, and the sophisticated ways believers relate ancient texts to contemporary contexts.

**The Belief that Science and Religion are Necessarily in Conflict** – A prevalent misconception, reinforced by some media representations, holds that religious belief and scientific understanding are inherently incompatible. Pupils may assume that religious people reject evolution, or that scientists cannot hold religious beliefs. Effective RS teaching addresses this false binary, exploring the range of relationships between scientific and religious accounts.

**The View that Morality Requires Religion** – Conversely, some pupils assume that ethical behaviour depends upon religious belief, or that without religion, there can be no basis for morality. This misconception requires careful unpacking, exploring both religious and non-religious ethical frameworks and the diversity of moral reasoning.

## Developing Teacher Subject Knowledge Expertise

### Pathways to Specialisation

Research on teacher expertise, including studies by the British Educational Research Association and subject-specific investigations by NATRE, identifies several pathways through which RS teachers develop subject knowledge:

**Initial Teacher Education (ITE)** – For those entering the profession through PGCE or School Direct routes with RS specialism, ITE provides foundational substantive and pedagogical knowledge. However, research consistently finds that even specialist RS teachers may have studied only one or two religious traditions in depth during their university education, leaving significant gaps in knowledge of other major worldviews.

**In-Service Professional Development** – Ongoing CPD represents the primary mechanism for knowledge development for most practising teachers. Effective CPD in RS includes subject knowledge updating, engagement with current research and scholarship, examination of new religious movements and changing religious landscapes, and development of pedagogical approaches for sensitive topics.

**Academic Study and Research** – Some teachers maintain or develop expertise through continued academic engagement, including Masters-level study, participation in research projects, and attendance at academic conferences. The Farmington Institute has historically supported such development, enabling teachers to engage with contemporary scholarship.

**Community Engagement and Fieldwork** – Direct engagement with religious communities through visits, dialogue, and ethnographic observation provides knowledge that cannot be acquired from textbooks alone. Such experiences develop what might be called "embodied knowledge" of religious practice—the understanding of how beliefs are lived, performed, and negotiated within actual communities.

### The Role of Subject Associations

NATRE (National Association of Teachers of Religious Education) and regional bodies such as the Association of Religious Education Inspectors, Advisers and Consultants (AREIAC) play crucial roles in knowledge development. Through publications, conferences, local networks, and online resources, these organisations disseminate current research, provide access to expert input, and create communities of practice where teachers develop knowledge collectively.

The RE Council of England and Wales, through its various projects and publications, has significantly influenced understandings of what teachers need to know. The "Religion and Worldviews" framework, developed by the Commission on RE, proposes expanded subject knowledge requirements that encompass non-religious worldviews and multiple disciplinary approaches.

### Mentoring and Collaborative Learning

Research on teacher expertise emphasises the importance of collaborative learning and mentoring. For RS teachers, this includes:

**Mentoring by Subject Experts** – Early career teachers benefit significantly from mentoring by experienced RS specialists who can model disciplinary thinking, share resources, and provide feedback on knowledge representation.

**Cross-Phase Collaboration** – Dialogue between primary and secondary specialists helps ensure progression in subject knowledge. Primary teachers often possess expertise in developmental approaches to teaching about religion, while secondary specialists bring deeper disciplinary knowledge.

**Inter-Religious and Cross-Worldview Dialogue** – Engagement with educators from different worldview backgrounds enriches understanding. Projects bringing together teachers from religious and non-religious perspectives to collaborate on curriculum development have demonstrated significant professional learning benefits.

## The Relationship Between Teacher and Pupil Knowledge

### The Knowledge Transmission Paradox

RS presents a particular version of the pedagogical paradox inherent in all teaching: teachers possess knowledge that pupils do not, yet the goal is not simply to transfer this knowledge from teacher to learner. In RS, this paradox is complicated by the nature of the knowledge itself. Much of what is studied—religious experience, ultimate meaning, ethical conviction—is not straightforwardly factual. Teachers cannot simply convey what it means to be a Buddhist; they must create conditions in which pupils can develop their own understanding, whilst ensuring that understanding is grounded in accurate representation of Buddhist traditions.

Research by Barbara Wintersgill and the University of Exeter's RS assessment project explored this tension, proposing that effective RS teaching requires teachers to hold knowledge in a particular way—not as material to be deposited in pupils' minds, but as a resource for designing learning experiences that enable pupils to construct their own understanding.

### The Importance of Teacher Knowledge for Pupil Questioning

A substantial body of research, including classroom studies by Judith Everington and others, demonstrates that teachers with strong subject knowledge create classroom environments where pupils ask more sophisticated questions. When teachers can engage meaningfully with pupil queries, responding with accurate information and probing follow-up questions, pupils learn that their questions are valued and develop confidence in intellectual exploration.

Conversely, when teachers lack subject knowledge, they tend to close down pupil questions, redirecting discussion to familiar territory or relying on generic facilitation techniques that fail to advance understanding. This is particularly problematic in RS, where pupil questions often touch on sensitive, controversial, or existentially significant matters.

### Subject Knowledge and Assessment for Learning

Effective assessment in RS requires teachers to understand both what pupils currently know and what sophisticated understanding looks like. This demands strong subject knowledge—teachers must recognise partial or developing understanding, identify misconceptions, and design activities that move pupils toward deeper engagement.

The National Association of Teachers of Religious Education and various examination boards have published assessment frameworks that articulate progression in RS. However, research suggests that applying these frameworks effectively requires substantial subject knowledge. Teachers with limited expertise may focus assessment on factual recall, missing opportunities to evaluate and develop pupils' skills in interpretation, analysis, and evaluation.

### Differentiation and Inclusion

Subject knowledge is essential for effective differentiation. Teachers must understand both the core concepts that all pupils should encounter and the various pathways through which different learners might access these concepts. In RS, this includes knowing multiple ways into understanding complex religious ideas—through narrative, ritual, art, ethical debate, or philosophical argument—and being able to match approaches to individual learners.

Research on inclusion in RS, including work by Bob Jackson on interpretive pedagogy, emphasises that effective inclusive practice requires deep subject knowledge. Teachers must understand which aspects of religious traditions are genuinely central and which represent peripheral or culturally specific elements that might be modified for particular learners without distorting the tradition.

## Challenges in Maintaining and Developing Subject Knowledge

### The Changing Religious Landscape

One of the most significant challenges facing RS teachers is the rapidly changing religious landscape of the United Kingdom. Census data, surveys by organisations such as the British Social Attitudes survey, and research by the Pew Research Centre document significant shifts in religious affiliation, practice, and identity. Teachers must update their knowledge to reflect:

**The Growth of Religious Non-Affiliation** – Increasing numbers of pupils and their families identify as having no religion. Teachers need knowledge of non-religious worldviews, including secular humanism, atheism, and agnosticism, to represent these positions accurately and ensure the curriculum speaks to all pupils.

**The Diversification of Christianity** – While Christian affiliation declines overall, the nature of British Christianity is changing, with growth in Pentecostal and charismatic churches, particularly among Black majority churches and migrant communities. Teachers need knowledge of these traditions, which may differ significantly from the Anglican and Catholic Christianity that dominated religious education historically.

**The Complexity of Muslim Communities** – British Muslim communities are diverse, encompassing different ethnic backgrounds, theological orientations, and cultural practices. Teachers require nuanced knowledge that avoids homogenising "Muslim experience" whilst recognising genuine commonalities.

**New Religious Movements and Alternative Spiritualities** – From Neo-Paganism to the various forms of contemporary spirituality, teachers encounter pupils whose families practise worldviews that may receive little coverage in traditional agreed syllabuses.

### The Challenge of Controversial Issues

RS teachers regularly encounter controversial issues, from abortion and euthanasia to religious extremism and sexuality. Maintaining subject knowledge in these areas requires staying current with:

**Theological Developments** – Religious traditions are not static; they evolve in response to changing social contexts. Teachers need awareness of contemporary theological debates and developments within traditions.

**Sociological Research** – Understanding how religious communities actually live, not just their official teachings, requires engagement with sociological and ethnographic research.

**Legal and Policy Changes** – Changes in law and policy, such as the legalisation of same-sex marriage or debates about religious dress, impact on RS content and require teachers to update their knowledge.

### Time and Resource Constraints

Research consistently identifies time as the primary barrier to subject knowledge development. RS teachers, particularly in smaller departments or as sole specialists, often have limited time allocated for professional reading, course attendance, or curriculum development. This is compounded by the breadth of the subject—even dedicated specialists struggle to maintain current knowledge across multiple traditions and disciplines.

## Frameworks for Supporting Subject Knowledge Development

### School and Trust-Level Strategies

Effective schools and multi-academy trusts implement systematic approaches to supporting RS teacher subject knowledge:

**Protected Professional Learning Time** – Allocating dedicated time for RS teachers to engage with subject-specific reading, online courses, or collaborative planning.

**Access to Resources** – Providing subscriptions to subject-specific journals, access to academic databases, and collections of high-quality textbooks and scholarly works.

**Links with Higher Education** – Establishing relationships with university theology and religious studies departments, enabling access to academic expertise and research seminars.

**Visits and Encounters** – Supporting and funding visits to places of worship, encounters with faith practitioners, and engagement with diverse religious communities.

**Specialist Recruitment** – Where possible, recruiting teachers with relevant academic backgrounds or providing incentives for non-specialists to develop RS expertise.

### System-Level Support

At the system level, several initiatives support subject knowledge development:

**The National Professional Qualification (NPQ) in Leading Teacher Development** – While not subject-specific, this qualification supports leaders in designing effective professional development, including subject knowledge programmes.

**Subject Hubs and Networks** – Various regional and national networks provide opportunities for knowledge-sharing and collaborative development.

**Research and Scholarship** – Organisations such as the Religious Education Council, Farmington Trust, and university-based research centres contribute to the knowledge base and its dissemination to practitioners.

## Conclusion

Teacher subject knowledge in Religious Studies is a complex, multi-dimensional construct that encompasses substantive knowledge of religious and non-religious traditions, disciplinary understanding of how such knowledge is constructed and evaluated, and pedagogical expertise in making complex concepts accessible to learners. The research base demonstrates that subject knowledge is fundamental to teaching quality, influencing everything from curriculum planning and resource selection to classroom interaction and assessment practice.

Developing and maintaining subject knowledge presents particular challenges in RS due to the subject's breadth, the contested nature of its boundaries, and the rapidly changing religious landscape. Effective professional learning combines formal training, collaborative engagement, community encounter, and ongoing reflective practice. Schools and trusts that prioritise RS teacher subject knowledge development reap dividends in the quality of pupil learning and the contribution RS makes to the broader educational purposes of the institution.

The relationship between teacher and pupil knowledge in RS is not merely one of transmission but of transformation. Teachers use their expertise to create conditions in which pupils can develop sophisticated understanding of diverse worldviews, critical skills in evaluating claims, and the capacity for informed, respectful engagement with difference. This educational ambition demands subject teachers who are themselves committed to ongoing learning—modelling the intellectual curiosity and openness to evidence that characterises both good education and authentic religious enquiry.
