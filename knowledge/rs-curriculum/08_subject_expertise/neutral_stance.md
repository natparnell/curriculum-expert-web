# The 'Neutral Stance' Misconception in Religious Education

## Introduction: Why Neutrality Matters

The question of teacher neutrality in Religious Education (RE) represents one of the most persistent and problematic confusions in the professional practice of the subject. Teachers frequently struggle to locate themselves appropriately in relation to the religious and non-religious worldviews they teach, uncertain whether professional integrity requires them to conceal their own positions, whether they must present all views as equally valid, or whether any expression of personal conviction constitutes indoctrination.

This confusion is understandable. RE occupies a unique position in the curriculum, dealing as it does with matters that many people consider deeply personal, profoundly important, and ultimately contested. Unlike teaching the water cycle or quadratic equations, teaching about religion inevitably touches on questions of ultimate meaning, moral values, and existential commitment. In this contested space, teachers naturally seek guidance on how to position themselves, and "neutrality" often appears to offer a safe harbour.

However, the concept of neutrality in RE is considerably more complex than it first appears. The popular understanding of neutrality—as a stance of complete impartiality where the teacher withholds all personal views and presents all positions as equally valid—rests on philosophical confusion about the nature of education, misunderstanding about the impossibility of value-free teaching, and conflation of appropriate educational practice with inappropriate indoctrination.

This knowledge file examines the "neutral stance" misconception in depth, exploring what neutrality actually means and does not mean in the context of RE, distinguishing carefully between representation and endorsement, and articulating what constitutes genuinely appropriate teacher stance. Drawing on Ofsted guidance, professional body statements from the National Association of Teachers of Religious Education (NATRE) and the Religious Education Council (REC), philosophical analysis of education and values, and empirical research on classroom practice, the file provides practical guidance for teachers navigating these complex professional waters.

## The Myth of Complete Neutrality

### The Impossibility of Value-Free Teaching

The first fundamental point to establish is that complete neutrality in teaching is neither possible nor desirable. Every educational act embodies values: the decision to teach certain topics rather than others, the selection of particular resources, the framing of questions, the allocation of classroom time, and the criteria for assessment—all reflect judgments about what is important, what is true, and what is worth knowing. Teachers cannot step outside their own frameworks of meaning to occupy some imagined "view from nowhere."

This is not a controversial claim in educational philosophy. Since the mid-twentieth century, scholars have recognised that the aspiration to value-free education rests on an untenable distinction between facts and values. Even the most "objective" scientific teaching embodies commitments to evidence, rationality, and honest inquiry—values that themselves require justification and which some worldviews may reject. The RE classroom is not a space somehow purified of values but rather a space in which values are brought into conscious awareness and subjected to critical examination.

What follows from this is not that teachers should abandon any aspiration to fairness or impartiality, but that we need a more sophisticated understanding of what appropriate teacher stance involves. The goal is not to eliminate the teacher's perspective but to handle it responsibly, modelling how thoughtful people engage with views different from their own whilst maintaining their own intellectual integrity.

### The Confusion of Neutrality with Fairness

Much of the difficulty around neutrality stems from conflating two distinct concepts: neutrality and fairness. Fairness in RE means ensuring that religious and non-religious worldviews are represented accurately, without distortion or caricature, and that pupils have opportunity to learn about diverse perspectives. It means avoiding the privileging of one tradition over others, ensuring that minority views receive appropriate attention, and challenging stereotypes and misrepresentations.

Neutrality, by contrast, suggests a stance of non-commitment—a refusal to take any position on the matters under discussion. But fairness does not require this. A teacher can be scrupulously fair in representing diverse religious positions whilst also maintaining their own worldview commitments. Indeed, it is precisely because worldviews matter—because they involve truth claims and existential commitments—that fairness is important. If all views were genuinely equivalent, there would be no need for careful representation; any portrayal would do.

The confusion becomes particularly acute when teachers interpret professional guidance about "impartiality" as requiring them to conceal or suppress their own views. Ofsted's guidance on teaching about controversial issues emphasises that teachers should maintain "appropriate impartiality," but this does not mean teachers must pretend to have no views. Rather, it means that teachers should ensure their personal views do not distort the representation of other positions or restrict pupils' opportunity to form their own judgments.

### The "Equal Validity" Fallacy

A common manifestation of the neutrality misconception is the belief that RE teachers must present all religious and non-religious worldviews as equally valid or true. This "equal validity" approach stems from a laudable desire to respect diversity and avoid offending pupils from different backgrounds, but it fundamentally misunderstands both the nature of religion and the purpose of education.

Religious traditions themselves do not typically claim to be "equally valid" with other traditions. A Christian believes Jesus is the Son of God; a Muslim believes Jesus was a prophet but not divine. These are not "equally true" from the perspective of either tradition; they are competing truth claims. To present them as merely different "paths up the same mountain" is to misrepresent how most believers actually understand their commitments.

Moreover, the equal validity approach denies pupils the opportunity to engage seriously with questions of truth. If all views are equally valid, there is nothing to discuss, no reason to examine evidence or arguments, no point in the careful reasoning that characterises high-quality RE. The subject becomes reduced to cataloguing different opinions rather than exploring whether those opinions are well-founded.

Appropriate RE does not require teachers to endorse or reject the truth claims of any tradition. Rather, it requires that pupils encounter these claims seriously, understand the reasons and evidence offered in their support, recognise the diversity of views within and between traditions, and develop the skills to evaluate arguments fairly. This is educational engagement with truth claims, not suspension of judgment about them.

## Representation Without Endorsement

### The Core Distinction

The key to understanding appropriate teacher stance lies in distinguishing carefully between representation and endorsement. Teachers must represent religious and non-religious worldviews accurately, fairly, and fully—this is their professional responsibility. Representation involves presenting views as they are understood by those who hold them, using the concepts and language believers themselves use, and conveying why these views matter to adherents.

Endorsement, by contrast, involves presenting views as true, correct, or worthy of adoption. A teacher who endorses a particular religion presents it not merely as one view among others but as the view that pupils should accept. This crosses the line from education into promotion, from informing pupils about religion to recruiting them into it.

The distinction is clear in principle but can be subtle in practice. Consider how a teacher might approach the Christian doctrine of the Incarnation. Representation would involve explaining that Christians believe Jesus was both fully human and fully divine, exploring the biblical basis for this belief, examining how theologians have understood and defended it, and conveying its significance for Christian worship and ethics. This can be done accurately regardless of whether the teacher personally accepts the doctrine.

Endorsement, however, would involve presenting the Incarnation as fact, encouraging pupils to accept it as true, or using the classroom as an opportunity to evangelise. The teacher might say "We believe that Jesus is the Son of God" (implying the class collectively holds this belief), invite pupils to pray, or suggest that those who reject the doctrine are mistaken or deficient.

### The Role of Empathy and Understanding

Effective representation requires more than factual accuracy; it demands empathy and interpretive understanding. To represent a worldview fairly, teachers must understand how it looks from the inside—what it means to those who hold it, how it shapes their experience, what it answers for them. This requires what Robert Jackson calls "interpretive understanding": the capacity to grasp concepts within the frameworks of meaning in which they function.

Developing such understanding does not require teachers to adopt the beliefs they represent. Atheist teachers can represent Christian views fairly; Christian teachers can represent humanist views fairly. What is required is intellectual and imaginative engagement with other perspectives—the capacity to think and feel one's way into unfamiliar frameworks of meaning.

Indeed, the ability to represent views one does not share is fundamental to education. History teachers represent the perspectives of historical actors whose values they do not endorse. Literature teachers help pupils understand characters and authors whose worldviews differ from their own. RE is not unique in requiring this capacity; it is unique only in the range of worldviews it encompasses and the contested nature of the subject matter.

### Avoiding Misrepresentation Through Distance

An important consideration in representation is avoiding misrepresentation that arises from excessive distance or excessive closeness to a tradition. Teachers who are entirely outside a tradition may misrepresent it through lack of understanding—using inappropriate categories, missing significant nuances, or failing to grasp why adherents find the tradition compelling. Conversely, teachers who are too close to a tradition—who have never examined it critically or engaged seriously with alternative perspectives—may misrepresent it through uncritical acceptance, presenting contested interpretations as established facts.

The ideal is what might be called "critical insider perspective"—understanding a tradition well enough to represent it accurately and empathetically whilst maintaining sufficient analytical distance to recognise its contested nature and its relationship to other perspectives. This is not a matter of neutrality but of knowledgeable, reflective engagement.

For teachers who hold strong commitments to particular worldviews, this requires genuine engagement with perspectives they believe to be mistaken. For teachers without such commitments, it requires recognition that religious traditions are not merely collections of interesting beliefs but living systems of meaning that deserve serious intellectual engagement.

## What Neutrality Actually Means in RE

### Educational Neutrality as Procedural Fairness

When educational policy and professional guidance refer to "neutrality" in RE, what is typically meant is not suspension of all judgment but procedural fairness in the treatment of different worldviews. This involves several concrete commitments:

**Equal Attention**: Ensuring that no single tradition dominates the curriculum whilst others are marginalised. In the English context, this means giving adequate attention to Christianity (which has historically been privileged), whilst also ensuring that other major traditions—Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism, Buddhism—are taught substantively, and that non-religious worldviews such as Humanism are represented.

**Accurate Representation**: Presenting each tradition as it is understood by thoughtful adherents, avoiding caricature, stereotyping, or the reduction of complex traditions to their most exotic or controversial features. This requires attention to diversity within traditions as well as between them.

**Fair Assessment**: Ensuring that assessment does not privilege pupils from particular backgrounds or penalise those who hold views different from the teacher's. This includes being alert to unconscious bias in marking and ensuring that examination of controversial issues does not put pupils in positions where they feel pressured to reveal or defend personal beliefs.

**Open Inquiry**: Creating classroom conditions where pupils feel safe to explore questions, express doubts, and consider alternative perspectives without fear of ridicule or penalty. This does not mean that all views are treated as equally valid, but that all views can be examined and questioned fairly.

### The Teacher as Model of Reflective Engagement

An important dimension of appropriate teacher stance is the modelling of reflective engagement with worldviews. Rather than presenting themselves as having no views, effective RE teachers model how thoughtful people hold their convictions whilst remaining open to learning from others. They demonstrate that it is possible to disagree respectfully, to find others' views interesting and even compelling without necessarily adopting them, and to revise one's views in light of new evidence or argument.

This modelling function is particularly important in RE because pupils are often developing their own worldviews and need examples of how to do so thoughtfully. The teacher who conceals all personal conviction provides no model of committed thinking; the teacher who treats all views as equally valid provides no model of critical evaluation. What is needed is the middle path: the teacher who shows what it looks like to hold views responsibly, with awareness of alternatives and openness to challenge.

Research by the Farmington Institute and others has found that pupils value teachers who are "real" about their own perspectives whilst remaining respectful of others. This does not require full disclosure of personal beliefs—such disclosure may sometimes be inappropriate or distracting—but it does require authenticity in how the teacher engages with the subject matter.

### Institutional Neutrality and Teacher Commitment

An important distinction exists between institutional neutrality and individual teacher neutrality. Community schools and non-religious academies are required to be neutral in the sense that they do not promote particular religious or non-religious worldviews. This institutional neutrality ensures that pupils from diverse backgrounds receive education without facing proselytisation.

However, institutional neutrality does not require individual teachers to be personally neutral. Teachers in community schools hold diverse worldview commitments—religious, non-religious, uncertain—and these commitments inevitably influence their teaching. What matters is not that teachers have no commitments but that their teaching remains within the bounds of educational appropriateness, representing diverse views fairly and enabling pupils to form their own judgments.

Faith schools operate within different legal frameworks, with greater scope for teaching within a particular religious tradition. Even here, however, the same principles of representation and fairness apply to how other traditions are taught. A Catholic school may teach from a Catholic perspective, but when it teaches about Islam or Humanism, it must represent these views fairly and accurately, not merely critique them from a Catholic standpoint.

## Common Misconceptions About Teacher Stance

### Misconception 1: Teachers Must Conceal All Personal Views

Perhaps the most widespread misconception is that RE teachers must never reveal their own worldview positions. This belief stems from a reasonable concern about inappropriate influence but extends it to an untenable extreme. In practice, complete concealment is neither possible nor desirable.

Teachers reveal their views constantly through the questions they ask, the examples they choose, the tone they adopt, and the connections they make. A teacher who presents arguments against religious belief whilst never acknowledging counterarguments reveals their position as clearly as one who explicitly states it. The choice is not between concealment and disclosure but between unconscious revelation and thoughtful, appropriate sharing.

Moreover, attempts at complete concealment can undermine educational trust. Pupils are often curious about their teachers' views and may perceive evasion as dishonesty or condescension. A teacher who refuses to answer direct questions about their beliefs whilst expecting pupils to engage with existential questions can seem inauthentic or hypocritical.

Appropriate practice involves thoughtful judgment about when disclosure is helpful and when it is distracting. Some contexts—particularly where pupils are asking directly, or where the teacher's experience illustrates a point being made—may warrant limited disclosure. The key is that disclosure serves educational purposes rather than promotional ones, and that teachers remain clear about the distinction between representing their own views and representing the views of the traditions being studied.

### Misconception 2: Teachers Must Treat All Views as Equally Valid

As discussed earlier, the belief that RE requires teachers to present all worldviews as equally valid or true fundamentally misunderstands the subject. This "soft" approach to RE avoids engaging seriously with truth claims, presenting religions as interchangeable lifestyle choices rather than as comprehensive systems of meaning and commitment.

In practice, treating all views as equally valid often results in superficial treatment. If every view is valid, there is no need to examine arguments or evidence; if every path leads to the same destination, there is no need to understand the distinctive features of different traditions. Pupils are left with a vague sense that "everyone's entitled to their opinion" without having developed the skills to evaluate whether opinions are well-founded.

Appropriate RE takes truth claims seriously. It enables pupils to understand why adherents believe what they do, what evidence and reasoning they offer, and how their beliefs might be evaluated. This requires teachers to engage seriously with questions of truth and validity—not to provide definitive answers, but to model how such questions can be examined thoughtfully.

### Misconception 3: Neutrality Means Avoiding Controversy

Some teachers interpret neutrality as requiring avoidance of controversial topics or questions. Fearful of causing offence or being accused of bias, they steer clear of difficult issues—religious approaches to gender and sexuality, tensions between religious and scientific accounts, controversial ethical questions—restricting their teaching to safe, descriptive content.

This approach fundamentally misunderstands both neutrality and RE. True neutrality involves fair treatment of controversial issues, not avoidance of them. Pupils are aware of controversial questions; they encounter them in the media, in their communities, and in their own thinking. RE that avoids these questions appears irrelevant and fails to prepare pupils for the complexity of the world they inhabit.

Appropriate engagement with controversy involves creating classroom conditions where diverse views can be explored respectfully. This includes establishing ground rules for discussion, ensuring that minority views are heard, challenging intolerant or discriminatory comments, and distinguishing between understanding a view and endorsing it. The goal is not to avoid controversy but to handle it educationally.

### Misconception 4: Religious Teachers Cannot Teach RE Objectively

A persistent misconception holds that teachers from religious backgrounds cannot teach RE objectively, whilst teachers without religious commitments can do so naturally. This assumption reflects misunderstanding about the nature of objectivity and bias.

In reality, all teachers bring perspectives to their teaching. Atheist teachers may be biased against religious worldviews; agnostic teachers may be biased toward viewing all strong commitments as suspect; religious teachers may be biased toward their own traditions. There is no perspective-free position from which objective teaching automatically flows.

What matters is not the absence of personal commitments but the capacity to represent other views fairly. Research by the Religious Education Council found that pupils value teachers who are knowledgeable about and respectful toward diverse traditions, regardless of the teachers' personal beliefs. A religious teacher who has studied other traditions thoroughly and who approaches them with genuine curiosity and respect may represent them more effectively than a non-religious teacher who has engaged only superficially.

Moreover, teachers from religious backgrounds often possess valuable insider knowledge that enhances their teaching. A teacher who has participated in religious rituals, wrestled with religious texts, or experienced religious community can convey aspects of religious life that purely academic study cannot capture. The question is not whether teachers have religious commitments but how they handle those commitments in their professional practice.

## Appropriate Teacher Stance: Principles and Practices

### Principle 1: Intellectual Honesty

The foundation of appropriate teacher stance is intellectual honesty—teaching in ways that align with the actual state of knowledge and uncertainty in the field. This means acknowledging the limits of current understanding, recognising where interpretations differ, and avoiding false certainty about contested questions.

Intellectual honesty requires teachers to distinguish between matters of established fact (such as what religious texts say or what practices particular communities engage in), matters of scholarly interpretation (such as how particular doctrines developed or how religious phenomena should be understood), and matters of ongoing debate (such as whether religious claims are true or how religion should be explained). Pupils benefit from seeing how knowledge is constructed and contested, not merely from receiving supposedly definitive answers.

This principle applies to the teacher's own position as well as to the content being taught. Teachers should model intellectual honesty by acknowledging the basis for their own views, recognising when they are expressing opinions rather than established facts, and demonstrating willingness to revise their views in light of evidence or argument. This modelling is more valuable than any pretence of having no views to express.

### Principle 2: Respectful Engagement

Appropriate teacher stance involves respectful engagement with all worldviews, including those the teacher may find objectionable or implausible. Respect does not mean agreement or endorsement; it means taking other views seriously as attempts to make sense of human existence, and engaging with them on their own terms before subjecting them to critique.

Respectful engagement manifests in several practical ways:

**Avoiding Caricature**: Representing views in their strongest, most coherent form rather than in straw-man versions that are easily dismissed. The principle of charity in interpretation requires giving the benefit of the doubt and seeking to understand why intelligent people might hold views different from one's own.

**Acknowledging Strengths**: Recognising the genuine insights and contributions of traditions one does not accept. Atheist teachers should acknowledge the moral achievements of religious traditions; religious teachers should acknowledge the integrity of humanist ethics. This is not grudging concession but genuine appreciation.

**Fair Critique**: When critique is appropriate, offering it fairly rather than mockingly or dismissively. This means engaging with actual arguments rather than stereotypes, recognising the diversity of views within traditions, and distinguishing between critique of ideas and denigration of the people who hold them.

### Principle 3: Pedagogical Focus

Ultimately, the RE teacher's role is pedagogical rather than advocatory. The teacher's job is to help pupils understand religious and non-religious worldviews, to develop their capacity for critical thinking about these worldviews, and to enable them to form their own informed judgments—not to recruit pupils to any particular position.

This pedagogical focus shapes every aspect of teacher stance. Questions are asked to develop understanding rather than to lead pupils to predetermined conclusions. Resources are selected to represent diverse perspectives rather than to support a particular viewpoint. Classroom discussion is facilitated to enable exploration rather than to reach consensus on contested questions.

The pedagogical focus also provides guidance for when teacher disclosure is appropriate. Disclosure serves pedagogical purposes when it helps pupils understand the nature of worldview commitment, models how thoughtful people hold convictions, or illustrates points about diversity of perspective. Disclosure becomes problematic when it seeks to persuade pupils to adopt the teacher's views or creates pressure for conformity.

### Principle 4: Contextual Sensitivity

Appropriate teacher stance varies according to context—pupil age, prior knowledge, classroom composition, and the specific topic being addressed. What is appropriate with sixth-formers exploring complex philosophical questions may differ from what is appropriate with Year 7 pupils encountering religious traditions for the first time.

Contextual sensitivity involves:

**Reading the Room**: Being attentive to how pupils are responding and adjusting accordingly. A class with strong religious identities represented may require different handling than a class where most pupils have no religious background. A pupil who has just expressed a personal belief may need acknowledgment rather than immediate critical analysis.

**Developmental Appropriateness**: Recognising that younger pupils may need more secure frameworks before being introduced to radical uncertainty, whilst older pupils need to encounter the full complexity of contested questions. This is not about protecting pupils from challenging ideas but about sequencing their encounter appropriately.

**Cultural Awareness**: Understanding how the local community context shapes pupils' experiences of RE. In some contexts, particular sensitivity may be needed around certain topics; in others, pupils may be frustrated by what they perceive as excessive caution. Effective teachers know their communities and adapt accordingly.

## Practical Classroom Applications

### Handling Pupil Questions About Teacher Beliefs

One of the most frequent challenges teachers face is responding when pupils ask directly about their own beliefs. There is no single right answer to this; appropriate response depends on context, relationship, and pedagogical purpose. However, several principles can guide decision-making:

**Consider the Motive**: Pupils ask about teacher beliefs for different reasons—genuine curiosity, testing whether the teacher is biased, seeking permission to express their own views, or simply distracting from the lesson. Understanding the motive helps determine how to respond.

**Be Authentic Within Boundaries**: Most pupils can detect evasion and respond better to honest uncertainty than to obvious deflection. Responses such as "That's a personal question, but what I can tell you is..." or "I have my own views, but what's more important is what you think..." can maintain authenticity whilst keeping focus on pupil learning.

**Use Disclosure Strategically**: Sometimes disclosure serves clear pedagogical purposes. A teacher might say "As it happens, I'm a Christian, which means I find the resurrection really significant, but I know Muslims understand Jesus differently and I want to make sure we understand both perspectives fairly." This models how personal commitment coexists with respect for diversity.

**Maintain Boundaries**: Teachers are entitled to privacy regarding personal beliefs. Persistent questioning should be handled by redirecting to the learning objectives: "I'm happy to talk about this after class, but right now we need to focus on..."

### Representing Contested Views Fairly

When teaching topics where different worldviews conflict—creation and evolution, religious approaches to gender and sexuality, euthanasia, or religious pluralism—teachers must navigate carefully between representing views fairly and avoiding the appearance of endorsing positions that some pupils or parents may find objectionable.

**Present the Spectrum**: Ensure pupils understand that there are multiple positions within and between traditions. On creation and evolution, for example, pupils should understand that some Christians accept evolutionary theory, others reject it, and others hold various intermediate positions. This prevents any single view from being presented as "the" religious or "the" scientific position.

**Use Reported Speech**: Framing discussion in terms of what "some Christians believe" or "according to Humanist philosophy" helps maintain appropriate distance. This is not evasion but accuracy—acknowledging that traditions contain internal diversity and that the teacher is reporting rather than pronouncing.

**Distinguish Description and Evaluation**: Be explicit about when you are describing what people believe and when you are examining arguments for and against positions. Pupils benefit from clarity about the level at which discussion is operating.

**Invite Pupil Perspectives**: Rather than the teacher being the source of all views, invite pupils to articulate positions: "We know some religious people oppose euthanasia; can anyone suggest why they might hold that view?" This distributes ownership of perspectives and reduces the sense that the teacher is endorsing particular positions.

### Dealing with Pupil Expressions of Belief

RE classrooms often become spaces where pupils express their own religious or non-religious commitments. Handling these expressions appropriately is crucial for maintaining an environment where all pupils feel respected.

**Acknowledge and Legitimate**: When pupils express personal beliefs, acknowledge them respectfully even when you cannot engage fully in the moment. "Thank you for sharing that perspective; it illustrates exactly the diversity we're studying" validates the pupil whilst maintaining educational focus.

**Avoid Positioning Pupils as Representatives**: Never ask a pupil to speak for their tradition or treat them as the authority on a religion because of their background. This is unfair to the pupil and may lead to misrepresentation of the tradition's diversity.

**Challenge Respectfully When Necessary**: If a pupil expresses views that are intolerant or factually inaccurate, challenge them, but do so educationally rather than punitively. "That's one view, but let's consider whether all Christians would agree..." invites reconsideration without shaming.

**Protect Minority Views**: Ensure that pupils who hold minority positions—whether religious or non-religious—are not marginalised or mocked. Establish clear ground rules for respectful discussion and enforce them consistently.

### Managing Classroom Discussion

The quality of classroom discussion in RE significantly depends on teacher facilitation skills. Managing discussion whilst maintaining appropriate stance requires:

**Active Neutrality in Facilitation**: The teacher should not use discussion as an opportunity to promote their own views, but should ensure that diverse perspectives are heard. This may mean actively inviting contributions from pupils whose views have not been represented or asking probing questions of majority positions.

**Summarising Fairly**: When summarising discussion, represent the range of views expressed accurately, without privileging the position you find most persuasive. "So we've heard that some people argue X because..., whilst others say Y because..." maintains appropriate distance.

**Moving Between Insider and Outsider Perspectives**: Effective RE discussion moves between "insider" perspectives (how the world looks from within a worldview) and "outsider" perspectives (critical analysis of worldviews). The teacher should facilitate both, helping pupils understand when they are operating in each mode.

**Knowing When to Close Discussion**: Not every question can be resolved through classroom discussion, and not every discussion should end with consensus. Sometimes the appropriate conclusion is acknowledging persistent disagreement or recognising that more information is needed. The teacher should be comfortable with open-endedness.

## Conclusion: Beyond Neutrality Toward Educational Integrity

The "neutral stance" misconception in RE reflects genuine uncertainty about how teachers should position themselves in relation to contested worldviews. However, the solution is not to strive for an impossible complete neutrality but to develop what might be called educational integrity—a stance that is honest about the teacher's own position, fair in representing diverse views, focused on pupil learning rather than persuasion, and respectful of the seriousness of the questions RE addresses.

Educational integrity does not require teachers to pretend they have no views. It requires them to handle their views responsibly, ensuring that their personal commitments do not distort the representation of other positions or restrict pupils' opportunity to form their own judgments. It requires moving beyond the fear that any expression of conviction constitutes indoctrination, toward confidence that teachers can model thoughtful worldview engagement without imposing their views on pupils.

The RE teacher's stance should be neither that of the blank slate (pretending to have no views) nor that of the advocate (promoting particular positions) but that of the informed facilitator—someone knowledgeable enough to represent diverse views accurately, confident enough to engage seriously with contested questions, humble enough to acknowledge the limits of their own perspective, and committed above all to helping pupils develop their own capacity for thoughtful engagement with worldviews.

In achieving this stance, RE teachers serve their pupils and their subject best. They demonstrate that it is possible to hold convictions whilst respecting those who differ, to engage seriously with questions of ultimate meaning whilst maintaining educational focus, and to navigate the contested terrain of religion and belief with intellectual honesty and pedagogical skill. This is not neutrality; it is something far more valuable—authentic, responsible engagement with the profound questions that make RE essential to a well-rounded education.
