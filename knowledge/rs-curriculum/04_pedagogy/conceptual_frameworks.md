# Conceptual Frameworks in Religious Education

## Introduction

Religious Education (RE) in English schools has undergone significant transformation over the past two decades, shifting from a model focused primarily on learning *about* religions to one that emphasises understanding religion and worldviews as complex, contested phenomena. At the heart of this transformation lies the development of conceptual frameworks that enable pupils to engage with religious and non-religious worldviews in increasingly sophisticated ways. This knowledge base explores three interconnected pedagogical approaches that have emerged as central to high-quality RE: Big Ideas and threshold concepts, concept cracking methodology, and the development of religious literacy.

## Big Ideas and Threshold Concepts

### Theoretical Foundations

The notion of organising curriculum around 'Big Ideas' has gained substantial traction in RE since the publication of the Warwick RE-searchers approach and the subsequent development of the Big Ideas for RE framework. Drawing on educational research about how students develop deep understanding, Big Ideas represent the essential, transferable understandings that pupils should develop through their study of religion and worldviews.

According to Freathy and Freathy (2019), Big Ideas serve as "generalised summaries of what we want students to understand through their study of religion and worldviews from 5–18 years." The Big Ideas for RE project has identified six core ideas: Continuity, change and diversity; Words and beyond; Making sense of life; Community, belonging and identity; The Big Questions; and Living a religious life.

### Threshold Concepts: Portals to New Understanding

The theory of threshold concepts, developed by Jan Meyer and Ray Land (2003), provides a powerful framework for understanding why certain ideas in RE prove so pivotal—and so challenging. A threshold concept represents a transformed way of understanding, or interpreting, or viewing something without which the learner cannot progress.

Key characteristics of threshold concepts include:

**Transformative:** Once understood, a threshold concept changes how a learner sees the subject and themselves. In RE, understanding that religious texts require interpretation—that they do not simply 'mean what they say'—fundamentally transforms how pupils engage with scripture.

**Irreversible:** Threshold concepts are difficult to unlearn. Once a pupil has understood that religious diversity exists not merely between but within traditions—that there is no single 'Christianity' but multiple Christianities—they cannot return to a view of religions as monolithic entities.

**Integrative:** Threshold concepts reveal previously hidden connections between different areas of knowledge. Understanding the concept of 'worldview' integrates learning about religious traditions with learning about non-religious philosophical perspectives.

**Bounded:** Threshold concepts demarcate conceptual boundaries. Understanding the difference between confessional and academic approaches to RE represents a bounded threshold concept.

**Troublesome:** Threshold concepts often prove difficult to grasp because they are counter-intuitive, alien, or conceptually difficult.

### Threshold Concepts in RE

Drawing on the work of David Didau (2015) and Dawn Cox (2015), several threshold concepts appear particularly significant for RE curriculum design:

- **Understanding the contested nature of religion and belief**
- **Understanding the relationship between experience, belief, practice, and values**
- **Understanding the metaphorical and symbolic nature of religious language**
- **Understanding diversity within and across traditions**
- **Understanding the ways religious commitment affects people's lives**

## Concept Cracking: A Practical Pedagogy

### Origins and Principles

Concept cracking, developed by Trevor Cooling and colleagues at Canterbury Christ Church University, represents a practical classroom methodology for developing conceptual understanding in RE. The central insight of concept cracking is that religious education should aid pupils to 'crack the concepts' that underpin the teaching of RE—the concepts behind the phenomena.

Concept cracking draws on hermeneutical pedagogy, recognising that understanding religion requires interpretation of symbolic, meaningful human activity. The approach has been particularly influential in the Understanding Christianity programme, which provides a conceptual framework for teaching Christianity through a hermeneutical lens focused on 'text, impact, connections'.

### The Concept Cracking Methodology

The concept cracking approach typically follows a structured sequence:

**1. Engagement with phenomena:** Pupils begin with concrete encounters with religious practice, text, or artefact.

**2. Concept identification:** Through teacher questioning and discussion, pupils identify the underlying concept that gives meaning to the phenomenon.

**3. Exploration across contexts:** Pupils explore how the identified concept appears in different contexts—different denominations, historical periods, cultural settings.

**4. Making connections:** Pupils make connections between the religious concept and wider human experience.

**5. Evaluation and response:** Finally, pupils engage in critical evaluation—assessing the coherence, implications, and credibility of the concept.

## Religious Literacy: The Ultimate Aim

### Defining Religious Literacy

Religious literacy has emerged as a key goal for RE in recent years. The American scholar Diane Moore (2007) defines religious literacy as "the ability to discern and analyze the fundamental intersections of religion and social/political/cultural life through multiple lenses."

For the UK context, the Commission on Religious Education (2018) identified religious literacy as encompassing:

- **Substantive knowledge:** Understanding the beliefs, practices, and values of religious and non-religious worldviews
- **Disciplinary knowledge:** Understanding how religion and worldviews are studied
- **Personal knowledge:** Understanding how worldviews shape human experience

### The Importance of Religious Literacy

Religious literacy matters for several interconnected reasons:

1. It supports social cohesion in a diverse society
2. It is essential for understanding contemporary affairs
3. It supports individual flourishing
4. It addresses the risk of extremism

## Integrating the Frameworks

Big Ideas/threshold concepts, concept cracking, and religious literacy represent complementary rather than competing approaches:

- **Big Ideas and threshold concepts** provide curriculum architecture
- **Concept cracking** offers classroom methodology
- **Religious literacy** articulates the ultimate goal

## Implementation Challenges

### Teacher Knowledge and Development

Implementing conceptual frameworks effectively depends on teachers with secure subject knowledge. Understanding threshold concepts requires teachers themselves to have passed through the thresholds.

### Assessment Challenges

Traditional assessment formats often struggle to capture conceptual understanding. Developing assessment approaches that validly and reliably measure conceptual understanding represents a significant challenge.

### Curriculum Coherence

Implementing conceptual frameworks requires curriculum coherence at multiple levels. This coherence is difficult to achieve where RE lacks status, where specialist teaching is limited, or where curriculum time is insufficient.

## Conclusion

Conceptual frameworks—Big Ideas and threshold concepts, concept cracking methodology, and religious literacy as educational goal—offer powerful resources for transforming RE pedagogy. They address fundamental challenges that have long faced the subject: how to move beyond superficial coverage of content, how to develop transferable understanding, and how to prepare pupils for life in a religiously diverse world.
