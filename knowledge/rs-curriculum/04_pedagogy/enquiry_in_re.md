# Enquiry in Religious Education

Enquiry-based learning lies at the heart of effective Religious Education (RE), enabling pupils to develop the intellectual tools necessary to engage seriously with questions of meaning, purpose, and value. Rather than approaching RE as merely the transmission of factual information about religions, an enquiry model positions pupils as active investigators who construct understanding through questioning, exploration, and reflection. This pedagogical approach aligns with the educative purpose of RE as defined by the RE Council and reflects Ofsted's emphasis on deep, meaningful learning that contributes to pupils' spiritual, moral, social, and cultural (SMSC) development.

The enquiry approach in RE is distinctive because it must balance the need for open-ended critical investigation with respect for the beliefs and practices of diverse religious and non-religious communities. As NATRE guidance emphasises, RE is fundamentally "built on questions of meaning" with a strong focus on ethics and morals. A good RE lesson, therefore, becomes part of the student's ongoing "search for meaning," providing structured opportunities for reflection on how religious and philosophical questions connect to their own lives and perspectives.

## The Rationale for Enquiry-Based RE

The shift towards enquiry-based approaches in RE reflects broader educational research demonstrating that meaningful learning occurs when pupils engage actively with ideas rather than passively receiving information. The Ofsted subject report "Religious Education: Realising the Potential" (2013) found that effective RE departments employed "open-ended critical questions about religion" balanced with respect for differences of opinion and lifestyle. This balance is essential: enquiry in RE is not about undermining religious belief but about developing the intellectual capacities to engage with religious claims seriously and critically.

Enquiry-based RE addresses what research identifies as a common weakness in traditional approaches: the tendency for pupils to accumulate disconnected facts about religions without developing the ability to think independently about the claims and truths those religions present. Through structured enquiry, pupils learn to make connections between different pieces of information, evaluate evidence, consider multiple perspectives, and construct reasoned responses to complex questions. This approach develops religious literacy—the ability to understand, interpret, and evaluate religious beliefs and practices—rather than merely religious knowledge.

The RE Council's "Big Ideas for Religious Education" framework identifies substantive knowledge as including not only content specific to particular worldviews but also content organised through overarching concepts or "big ideas" related to the study of religion. Enquiry provides the pedagogical vehicle for engaging with these big ideas, moving beyond surface-level description to deeper understanding of how religions address fundamental human questions about existence, morality, community, and transcendence.

## Core Principles of Enquiry in RE

### Open yet Structured Investigation

Effective enquiry in RE combines intellectual openness with appropriate structure. Pupils need freedom to explore questions that genuinely interest them and to follow lines of investigation that emerge from their engagement with material. At the same time, they require scaffolding to ensure their investigations are rigorous, respectful, and educationally productive. This balance is achieved through carefully designed enquiry questions that are genuinely open—meaning they cannot be answered with a simple yes/no or single factual response—while being sufficiently focused to guide investigation productively.

The RE Council's guidance emphasises that substantive knowledge in RE can be defined as content specific to religious or non-religious worldviews or content related to overarching concepts or "big ideas." Enquiry questions should connect to these big ideas, enabling pupils to engage with meaningful content while developing conceptual understanding. For example, rather than asking "What do Muslims believe about God?" (a factual question), an enquiry might ask "How does the Muslim concept of Tawhid (divine unity) shape Muslim understandings of human responsibility?" This question requires factual knowledge but demands that pupils use that knowledge to develop conceptual understanding.

### Balancing the Three Lenses

The Commission on Religious Education's proposed National Entitlement (2018) introduced the framework of studying religion and worldviews through three lenses: theology, philosophy, and human/social sciences. Effective enquiry in RE draws on all three lenses, recognising that different questions require different disciplinary approaches. Theological enquiry might explore how believers interpret sacred texts or understand divine revelation. Philosophical enquiry examines questions of truth, knowledge, and existence. The human/social sciences lens investigates how religions function in society, how they shape and are shaped by culture, and how they influence individual and collective identity.

An enquiry on the problem of suffering, for instance, might begin with theological enquiry into how different religions explain the existence of suffering in relation to their understanding of the divine. It might then move to philosophical enquiry into the logical consistency of different theodicies (attempts to justify God's existence despite evil). Finally, it could incorporate social scientific enquiry into how religious communities actually respond to suffering in practice. This multi-disciplinary approach reflects the complexity of religion as a phenomenon and prepares pupils for the interdisciplinary nature of religious studies at higher levels.

### Authentic Questioning

Central to enquiry-based RE is the cultivation of authentic questioning—questions that genuinely matter to pupils and to which no single, simple answer exists. The Ofsted framework for RE inspection assesses whether pupils are engaged in investigations that promote higher-order thinking skills and conceptual understanding. Authentic questions in RE typically address existential concerns: questions about meaning, purpose, mortality, suffering, ethics, and identity that religions have engaged with across history and that continue to resonate with human experience today.

The "Big Questions" approach adopted by many locally agreed syllabi organises RE around key questions that are both conceptually significant and existentially resonant. These might include questions like "Why is there suffering?" "What happens when we die?" "How should we live?" and "What makes something right or wrong?" Such questions have the advantage of being simultaneously universal (relevant to all human beings) and particular (addressed in distinctive ways by different religious and philosophical traditions).

## Models of Enquiry in RE

### The Four-Phase Enquiry Model

While various models of enquiry exist, most share a similar structure that can be understood as comprising four phases: engagement and questioning; investigation and exploration; interpretation and evaluation; and reflection and response. This structure provides a flexible framework that can be adapted for different age groups, topics, and timeframes.

**Phase One: Engagement and Questioning**

The initial phase focuses on capturing pupils' interest and establishing the enquiry question. Effective engagement strategies include using visual stimuli, artefacts, stories, or contemporary events to provoke curiosity and raise questions. The teacher's role is to facilitate the emergence of questions from pupils while ensuring the enquiry remains educationally focused. This phase often involves "puzzling" activities that present pupils with a paradox, mystery, or problem that demands investigation.

Key considerations for this phase include ensuring that the enquiry question is sufficiently open to allow genuine investigation while being sufficiently focused to be manageable. The question should require pupils to draw on substantive knowledge about religion while also engaging their own thinking and reflection. For younger pupils, the enquiry question might be articulated by the teacher based on pupils' emerging questions; for older pupils, there should be increasing opportunity to shape the enquiry question themselves.

**Phase Two: Investigation and Exploration**

The investigation phase involves pupils gathering information and evidence to address the enquiry question. In RE, investigation typically draws on multiple sources: sacred texts, religious artefacts, case studies of religious practice, scholarly interpretations, and the accounts of believers themselves. The key pedagogical principle is that investigation should be active rather than passive—pupils should be making decisions about what information they need, where to find it, and how to evaluate its relevance and reliability.

Different pedagogical approaches can structure the investigation phase. Some teachers use "expert groups" where pupils become specialists in one aspect of the topic and then teach others. Others employ jigsaw methods, flipped learning, or research projects. The crucial element is that pupils are engaged in processing information actively rather than merely receiving it. They should be questioning sources, comparing different accounts, identifying patterns, and beginning to formulate provisional answers to the enquiry question.

**Phase Three: Interpretation and Evaluation**

Having gathered evidence, pupils need opportunities to interpret what they have found and evaluate its significance for the enquiry question. This phase demands higher-order thinking skills as pupils move beyond description to analysis, explanation, and evaluation. They need to consider how different sources might be interpreted differently, how religious believers themselves would understand the material, and how the evidence addresses the original enquiry question.

Interpretation in RE requires particular care because it involves engaging with beliefs and practices that may be unfamiliar or challenging. Pupils need to learn to "walk around" inside a worldview—to understand it from the perspective of those who hold it—while maintaining the critical distance necessary for academic study. This "interpretive" approach, associated with Robert Jackson's work on religious education, recognises that understanding religion requires both empathy and critical analysis.

**Phase Four: Reflection and Response**

The final phase involves pupils reflecting on what they have learned and formulating their own responses. This is distinct from simply stating an opinion; it requires pupils to draw on the evidence they have gathered, the interpretations they have developed, and their own critical thinking to construct a reasoned response to the enquiry question. The response might take various forms: written arguments, creative presentations, dialogues, or personal reflections.

Reflection should also include meta-cognitive consideration of the enquiry process itself—what have pupils learned about how to investigate religious questions? How has their thinking developed? What questions remain unanswered? This reflective dimension connects to SMSC development and contributes to pupils' broader intellectual growth.

### The Community of Enquiry Approach

Derived from Philosophy for Children (P4C), the Community of Enquiry approach applies dialogic pedagogy to RE. In this model, pupils sit in a circle and engage in structured dialogue about a stimulus (which might be a story, image, artefact, or question). The teacher facilitates rather than leads, helping pupils to listen to each other, build on each other's ideas, question assumptions, and develop collective understanding.

The Community of Enquiry model is particularly valuable for RE because it models respectful dialogue about questions on which people may fundamentally disagree. Pupils learn to disagree without being disagreeable, to subject their own views to critical scrutiny, and to recognise the limits of their own perspectives. This approach aligns with the British values agenda, particularly regarding mutual respect for and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs.

Research on Communities of Enquiry in RE has found that regular participation develops pupils' confidence in expressing their views, their ability to engage with complex ideas, and their capacity to hold nuanced positions rather than simplistic either/or thinking. The approach also supports oracy development, which the Oracy APPG has identified as a crucial but often neglected dimension of education.

### Concept-Based Enquiry

Drawing on the work of Lynn Erickson and other curriculum theorists, some RE practitioners employ concept-based enquiry that focuses on developing conceptual understanding rather than merely accumulating facts. This approach identifies key concepts within RE—such as sanctity, covenant, karma, revelation, or stewardship—and structures enquiries around developing pupils' understanding of these concepts.

Concept-based enquiry typically begins with the concrete (specific examples of a concept in practice), moves to the abstract (defining and exploring the concept itself), and then returns to the concrete (applying the conceptual understanding to new examples). This mirrors how pupils develop understanding: through encounter with multiple examples, extraction of the underlying pattern or concept, and then testing of that understanding against further examples.

In RE, concept-based enquiry is particularly valuable because it enables pupils to make connections between different religious traditions. While the specific expressions differ, many religions engage with similar underlying concepts: the nature of the divine, the problem of suffering, the basis of morality, the significance of death, and the importance of community. By structuring enquiry around concepts, teachers can help pupils recognise both the distinctiveness and the commonality of different religious responses.

## Questioning Techniques in RE

### Types of Questions

The questions teachers ask shape the nature of pupils' thinking. In enquiry-based RE, effective questioning moves between different types of questions depending on the learning purpose. Factual questions establish baseline knowledge: "What is the Five Ks in Sikhism?" "When do Muslims observe Ramadan?" These questions have right answers and are important for building the substantive knowledge upon which deeper enquiry depends.

Conceptual questions probe understanding of key ideas: "What does 'omnipotent' mean?" "How is 'karma' different from 'fate'?" These questions assess whether pupils grasp the meaning of religious concepts rather than merely being able to recite definitions. Evaluative questions demand critical thinking: "Is the design argument a convincing proof of God's existence?" "Does the problem of evil disprove God?" These questions have no single correct answer but require pupils to use evidence and reasoning to construct justified positions.

Open questions sustain enquiry by resisting easy answers: "Why do people suffer?" "What happens when we die?" "How do we know what is right?" These questions are authentically perplexing—they genuinely engage with the existential concerns that religions address. They also model the kind of questioning that characterises religious and philosophical inquiry itself.

### Socratic Questioning

Derived from the method of Socrates, Socratic questioning involves systematic probing of pupils' assumptions, reasoning, and evidence. In RE, Socratic questioning can be used to help pupils examine their own beliefs, test the coherence of religious doctrines, or explore the implications of ethical positions. The technique involves asking a series of follow-up questions that progressively deepen thinking: "What do you mean by that?" "Why do you think that?" "What evidence supports that view?" "What would be the consequences if everyone believed that?"

Socratic questioning is particularly valuable for developing critical thinking in RE because it models intellectual humility—the recognition that our beliefs should be subject to examination and that we might need to revise them in light of new evidence or better reasoning. It also helps pupils recognise the complexity of religious questions and resist the temptation to simplistic answers.

### Questioning for Inclusion

Effective questioning in RE must be inclusive, ensuring that all pupils can participate regardless of their religious background or beliefs. This requires sensitivity to the fact that some pupils may be speaking from within a religious tradition while others observe from outside. Questions should be framed in ways that do not privilege either perspective: "How do Christians understand...?" rather than "What do we think about...?" (which assumes a Christian perspective) or "What do they believe?" (which positions religious believers as exotic others).

Inclusive questioning also means creating space for pupils to draw on their own experience and perspective without feeling pressured to disclose personal beliefs. Questions like "What questions might someone ask about this?" or "What different responses might people have?" enable personal engagement without demanding personal revelation.

## Investigation Strategies

### Working with Sacred Texts

Investigation in RE often involves engagement with sacred texts, which requires specific interpretive skills. Pupils need to understand that sacred texts function differently within religious traditions than factual texts do for secular readers. For believers, sacred texts may be divinely inspired or revealed, carrying authority beyond that of ordinary texts. This does not mean that interpretive questions cannot be asked—religious traditions themselves have rich histories of textual interpretation—but it does mean that investigation must be respectful of the text's role in religious life.

Effective text investigation in RE involves several stages: understanding the context in which the text was produced (historical and cultural background); examining the text itself (what does it actually say?); exploring interpretive traditions (how have believers understood this text?); and considering the text's contemporary significance (how does it shape belief and practice today?). This multi-layered approach recognises that sacred texts are not merely historical documents but living resources that continue to shape religious communities.

### Using Artefacts and Visits

Religious artefacts provide concrete entry points for enquiry, enabling pupils to investigate through observation, questioning, and deduction. An artefact enquiry might begin with careful observation: What can we learn from looking at this object? What is it made of? What symbols or decoration does it carry? How might it be used? These observations generate questions that drive further investigation into the beliefs and practices that the artefact represents.

Visits to places of worship extend investigation into authentic contexts. Preparation for visits should establish clear enquiry questions that pupils will investigate during the visit: How does the architecture reflect religious beliefs? What do the rituals involve and what do they mean? How does the community use this space? Follow-up after visits should involve processing what was learned and connecting it to classroom enquiry.

### Engaging with Living Religion

Investigation in RE should include engagement with living religion—the actual beliefs and practices of religious people today. This might involve encountering visitors from religious communities, analysing case studies, examining media representations, or using resources produced by religious communities themselves. Such engagement humanises the study of religion, moving beyond abstract doctrines to the lived reality of religious commitment.

When engaging with living religion, ethical considerations are paramount. Pupils should be encouraged to approach with respect, recognising that they are encountering real people's deeply held convictions. At the same time, the educational purpose should be clear: understanding, not proselytisation or celebration. Pupils can respect beliefs without endorsing them, and enquiry should maintain the critical distance necessary for genuine understanding.

## Reflection in RE

### Forms of Reflection

Reflection in RE takes multiple forms, each serving different educational purposes. Intellectual reflection involves thinking about what has been learned: What do I now understand about this topic? How does it connect to what I already knew? What questions remain? This meta-cognitive reflection consolidates learning and identifies areas for further investigation.

Personal reflection connects learning to pupils' own lives and perspectives: What does this mean for me? How does it relate to my own experiences, beliefs, or values? This form of reflection supports SMSC development by encouraging pupils to engage personally with questions of meaning and value. However, personal reflection should be carefully structured to avoid becoming intrusive; pupils should never feel pressured to disclose private beliefs or experiences.

Evaluative reflection involves assessing the quality of investigation and response: How well did I use evidence? Did I consider different perspectives? Is my conclusion well-supported? This form of reflection develops critical self-awareness and supports improvement in future enquiry.

### Structuring Reflective Activities

Effective reflection requires structure; simply asking pupils to "reflect" is unlikely to produce deep thinking. Structured approaches include reflective journals where pupils record their developing thinking over time; exit tickets where pupils summarise key learning or pose questions at the end of lessons; thinking routines like "I used to think... but now I think..." that capture conceptual change; and dialogic reflection where pupils discuss their learning with partners or in groups.

Digital tools can support reflection, with platforms like Padlet, Seesaw, or Google Classroom enabling pupils to record reflections in various formats (text, audio, video). These tools have the advantage of creating a record of thinking over time, enabling pupils and teachers to track intellectual growth.

## Adapting Enquiry Models for Religion and Worldviews

### The Distinctive Nature of Religious Enquiry

While enquiry models from other subjects can inform RE practice, enquiry in religion and worldviews has distinctive features that require careful adaptation. Unlike scientific enquiry, where hypotheses
