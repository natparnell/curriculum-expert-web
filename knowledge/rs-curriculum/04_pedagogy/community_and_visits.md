# Community and Visits in Religious Education

## Introduction: The Educational Value of First-Hand Experience

Religious Education (RE) in English schools seeks to develop pupils' understanding of religious and non-religious worldviews, fostering skills of interpretation, analysis, and empathetic engagement. While classroom-based learning provides essential foundational knowledge, encounters with living faith communities through visits to places of worship and interactions with guest speakers offer irreplaceable educational experiences that transform abstract concepts into meaningful, embodied understanding.

The non-statutory guidance for RE (DfE, 2010) emphasises that high-quality religious education should enable pupils to encounter living faith traditions, not merely learn about them from textbooks. Ofsted's 2024 subject report, "Deep and Meaningful?", found that the most effective RE provision frequently involved carefully planned encounters between pupils and faith communities, though it also noted that such opportunities were inconsistently available across schools. When pupils meet practising members of religious communities in authentic contexts, they encounter the lived reality of faith in ways that challenge stereotypes, humanise abstract beliefs, and develop the religious literacy essential for navigating an increasingly diverse society.

The National Association of Teachers of Religious Education (NATRE), the UK's leading subject association, consistently advocates for visits and visitors as central components of excellent RE. Their guidance materials emphasise that these encounters serve multiple pedagogical purposes: they provide authentic sources for investigation, develop skills of respectful dialogue across difference, challenge the generalisations that Ofsted identified as problematic in many classrooms, and contribute to community cohesion by building relationships between schools and local faith communities. The Religious Education Council for England and Wales (REC) similarly promotes these experiences as essential for realising the subject's potential to contribute to social cohesion and mutual understanding.

This knowledge file examines the theoretical foundations, practical implementation, and pedagogical strategies for incorporating community engagement into RE across all key stages, drawing on statutory guidance, professional association recommendations, Ofsted findings, and established best practice in the field.


## The Theoretical Foundation: Why Community Engagement Matters

### From Abstract Knowledge to Embodied Understanding

The pedagogical rationale for community engagement in RE rests on well-established principles of experiential learning and constructivist educational theory. When pupils learn about religious traditions solely through secondary sources—textbooks, videos, or teacher exposition—they acquire what might be termed "abstract knowledge": information about beliefs, practices, and institutions that remains intellectually distant from their own experience. By contrast, encounters with living faith communities provide "embodied understanding" (Grimmitt, 2000), knowledge that is rooted in sensory experience, interpersonal connection, and emotional engagement.

This distinction matters profoundly for religious education. Religion is not merely a set of propositions to be learned but a way of life embodied by communities of practitioners. A pupil who has walked through the architectural space of a mosque, smelled the incense in an Orthodox church, or heard the chanting in a Buddhist temple has experienced dimensions of religious practice that no written description can fully convey. Similarly, a pupil who has asked questions of a practising Muslim, Hindu, or Humanist and received personal, thoughtful responses has encountered the internal diversity and lived complexity of worldviews in ways that counter simplistic generalisations.

Ofsted's 2024 subject report highlighted a significant concern: in many schools, "pupils were taught generalisations, for example that all followers of a particular religion might worship in the same way." This finding points to a fundamental challenge in RE pedagogy. When teachers lack direct experience of religious communities themselves, or when curriculum materials present sanitised, homogenised accounts of traditions, pupils develop stereotypical understandings that fail to reflect the actual diversity within and between religious communities. Carefully planned encounters with faith practitioners provide a natural corrective to such generalisations, as pupils inevitably encounter variation, nuance, and individual interpretation.

### The Hermeneutical Dimension: Interpreting Living Traditions

The interpretive nature of RE (hermeneutical RE) provides another theoretical foundation for community engagement. Following the work of Robert Jackson and the Warwick Religious Education Project, many contemporary RE curricula emphasise that understanding religion requires interpretation—not merely the accumulation of facts but the development of skills for making sense of religious phenomena in context. This interpretive turn in RE pedagogy naturally aligns with encounters with living traditions, as pupils must interpret what they observe, ask clarifying questions, and negotiate meaning across cultural boundaries.

Jackson's "interpretive approach" emphasises three key processes: representation (how religions are presented), interpretation (how they are understood), and reflexivity (how learners reflect on their own presuppositions). Community engagement supports all three processes. Representation is enriched by direct encounter with faith communities rather than relying solely on textual or media representations. Interpretation is developed through the need to make sense of unfamiliar practices, spaces, and perspectives. Reflexivity emerges naturally when pupils compare their own assumptions and experiences with those they encounter, recognising that their own worldview is also situated and partial.

### Education for Diversity and Social Cohesion

Beyond the specifically religious educational purposes, community engagement in RE serves broader educational aims related to diversity, citizenship, and social cohesion. The UK government's PREVENT strategy, community cohesion policies, and more recent integration agendas all recognise that meaningful encounter between people from different backgrounds is essential for building cohesive societies. RE, with its explicit focus on understanding diverse worldviews, is uniquely positioned to contribute to these goals through structured, educational encounters with difference.

Research on interfaith education consistently demonstrates that meaningful contact between people from different religious backgrounds, when structured appropriately, reduces prejudice, challenges stereotypes, and builds empathy. Allport's (1954) "contact hypothesis," developed and refined through decades of social psychological research, identifies the conditions for positive intergroup contact: equal status between groups, common goals, intergroup cooperation, and institutional support. Well-planned school visits and guest speaker sessions can create these conditions, positioning pupils as learners engaging respectfully with faith practitioners who possess valuable expertise, working together toward shared educational goals within the supportive framework of the school curriculum.

However, this educational potential is not automatic. As the research literature emphasises, contact without appropriate pedagogical framing can reinforce stereotypes or create awkward, uncomfortable encounters that damage intergroup relations. The following sections examine how to plan and implement community engagement in RE to realise its full educational potential while avoiding common pitfalls.


## Visiting Places of Worship

### The Educational Value of Sacred Spaces

Places of worship—churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, gurdwaras, and other sacred spaces—are not merely functional buildings where religious communities gather. They are, in themselves, rich educational resources that embody religious beliefs, cultural traditions, and community histories. For RE pedagogy, visits to such spaces offer unique learning opportunities that complement and extend classroom-based study.

Sacred architecture communicates theological and spiritual messages through material form. The orientation of a mosque toward Mecca, the raised platform (bima) in a synagogue where the Torah is read, the lotus-shaped dome of a Hindu temple, or the intricate iconography of an Orthodox church all encode religious meanings that pupils can read and interpret with appropriate guidance. The sensory dimensions of sacred spaces—the play of light through stained glass, the fragrance of incense, the acoustics of chanting or bells, the tactile qualities of textiles and artefacts—provide experiential knowledge that engages multiple learning modalities and creates lasting memories.

Beyond the physical space itself, places of worship are centres of community life, repositories of material culture, and sites where religious traditions are embodied in practice. A visit that includes observation of or participation in worship, opportunities to handle religious artefacts, and conversations with community members provides holistic understanding that no single classroom resource can replicate. Ofsted's research has consistently found that the most memorable and impactful RE often involves such direct encounters.

### Planning and Preparation: The Foundation of Successful Visits

Effective visits to places of worship require meticulous planning and preparation. The difference between a transformative educational experience and a superficial or even problematic encounter often lies in the quality of preparation undertaken by the school and the hosting community.

**Pre-visit preparation** serves multiple purposes. Pupils need sufficient background knowledge to understand what they will encounter, appropriate vocabulary to describe and ask about their observations, and clear behavioural expectations for entering sacred spaces. This preparation should include study of the religious tradition being visited, examination of architectural features and their significance, discussion of appropriate conduct (dress codes, removal of shoes, silence during prayer times), and clarification of learning objectives for the visit.

The pre-visit phase also involves logistical preparation: risk assessments in accordance with school policies, arranging transport, obtaining parental permissions, coordinating with the host community regarding timing and programme, and preparing any materials pupils will use during the visit. Teachers should ideally conduct a pre-visit reconnaissance to familiarise themselves with the space, meet the host, and identify potential issues.

**Collaboration with the host community** is essential. Places of worship are not museums or educational institutions; they are living centres of religious life where worship, community activities, and pastoral care take priority. Successful visits require negotiation with host communities to find mutually acceptable times (avoiding worship services unless observation is specifically intended), clarify expectations on both sides, and ensure that educational goals align with the community's willingness and capacity to host.

Many faith communities have established programmes for school visits, often coordinated by education officers or volunteer guides. These programmes vary in quality and educational approach. The best programmes provide structured experiences with clear educational objectives, opportunities for pupil questions, and engagement with multiple community members rather than reliance on a single spokesperson. Teachers should evaluate potential hosts not merely on convenience but on the quality of educational experience they can provide.

### Conduct During Visits

The conduct of the visit itself requires sensitive management to balance educational objectives with respect for the sacred nature of the space and the hospitality of the host community.

**Observing protocols** is fundamental. Different religious traditions have different expectations for behaviour in sacred spaces: removal of shoes, covering of heads (for men in some traditions, for women in others), modest dress, silence or quiet speech, restrictions on photography, and appropriate physical comportment. Pupils need clear briefing on these protocols and teachers must model appropriate behaviour.

**Structuring the experience** helps maximise educational value. Effective visits typically include: an orientation to the space and its layout; focused observation of specific features with accompanying explanation; opportunities for pupils to ask questions; and time for reflection or personal engagement. Some visits include participation in aspects of worship or ritual, which can provide powerful experiential learning but requires careful handling to ensure pupils understand they are observing or participating as learners, not as converts or devotees.

**Managing diversity within the visiting group** requires attention. School groups typically include pupils from various religious backgrounds and none, as well as pupils with different levels of prior knowledge and varying degrees of comfort with religious environments. Teachers need to create an inclusive atmosphere where all pupils feel welcome to participate while respecting that some may have religious convictions that affect their participation (for example, some evangelical Christian pupils may be discouraged by their families from entering non-Christian places of worship).

### Post-visit Follow-up

The educational value of a visit is significantly enhanced by structured follow-up back in the classroom. Without this, visits can become isolated experiences that fade from memory without being integrated into broader learning.

Effective follow-up includes opportunities for pupils to process and articulate their experiences through discussion, writing, art, or other expressive forms. This might involve comparing the visited place of worship with others studied, analysing photographs or sketches made during the visit, writing thank-you letters to hosts that demonstrate learning, or preparing presentations for other classes. Follow-up also provides opportunities to address misconceptions that may have arisen and to connect the visit to broader curriculum themes.


## Guest Speakers and Faith Practitioners

### The Role of Visitors in the RE Classroom

Inviting members of faith communities and holders of non-religious worldviews into the classroom to speak with pupils is a long-established RE pedagogy with significant educational value. When well-implemented, such encounters provide access to authentic voices, challenge stereotypes through personal testimony, and develop pupils' skills in respectful dialogue across difference.

NATRE's "Voices of Faith and Belief in Schools: Guidance and a Code of Conduct" (2014) provides comprehensive guidance for this practice. The document emphasises that visitors should enhance the educational purposes of RE, not replace them. They provide authentic perspectives and personal narratives that complement the teacher's role in providing structured curriculum coverage, critical questioning, and assessment of learning.

The presence of a living person who embodies a religious tradition differs fundamentally from studying that tradition through secondary sources. Pupils encounter not abstract doctrines but personal convictions, not institutional descriptions but individual interpretations, not homogenised generalisations but particular perspectives shaped by life experience, culture, and personality. This encounter with "lived religion" (McGuire, 2008) is essential for developing the sophisticated understanding of religious diversity that contemporary RE seeks to foster.

### Selecting and Preparing Speakers

The quality of the educational experience depends significantly on the selection and preparation of guest speakers. Not every member of a religious community makes an effective educational visitor, and teachers need to exercise professional judgment in their selection.

**Criteria for effective speakers** include: ability to communicate appropriately for the age group; willingness to engage with educational rather than proselytising purposes; capacity to represent their tradition while acknowledging internal diversity; and personal qualities that demonstrate the values they speak about. The best speakers can articulate their beliefs and practices clearly, respond thoughtfully to pupil questions, and model respectful engagement with different perspectives.

**Preparation and briefing** are essential. Speakers need clear information about the age group, prior learning, and specific curriculum context; the educational objectives for the session; the code of conduct expected (including the prohibition on proselytising); and practical details about timing, venue, and facilities. Many experienced speakers have developed their own materials and approaches, but teachers should discuss these in advance to ensure alignment with curriculum goals.

The prohibition on proselytising—seeking to convert pupils to the speaker's religion—is fundamental to ethical practice in RE. Visitors must understand that their role is educational, not evangelistic. This does not mean speakers cannot express personal conviction; indeed, authentic testimony is valuable. But the context is one of learning about diversity, not recruitment to particular religious positions. NATRE's code of conduct makes this clear, and teachers must be prepared to intervene tactfully if boundaries are crossed.

### Structuring Speaker Sessions

Effective speaker sessions require careful structure to maximise educational value while respecting the visitor's time and contribution.

**Preparation of pupils** ensures they can engage productively. This includes sufficient background knowledge to understand the speaker's tradition, generation of questions in advance, and discussion of appropriate conduct (listening respectfully, asking thoughtful questions, avoiding argumentative confrontation). Pupils should understand that the speaker is offering a personal perspective that may not represent all members of their tradition.

**Session structure** typically includes: the speaker's introduction of themselves and their tradition; focused presentation on specific aspects relevant to curriculum themes; substantial time for pupil questions; and appropriate conclusion. The balance between presentation and interaction varies depending on the speaker's style and pupils' age, but genuine dialogue is generally more educationally valuable than extended monologue.

**Teacher facilitation** remains crucial throughout. While the speaker provides content and perspective, the teacher maintains responsibility for educational objectives, pupil behaviour, and pedagogical framing. Teachers may need to clarify questions, bridge between the speaker's contributions and curriculum themes, address misconceptions, and ensure all pupils have opportunity to engage. The session is a collaborative educational endeavour, not a simple transfer of information from visitor to pupils.

### Addressing the Diversity of Visitor Voices

A significant challenge in using guest speakers is ensuring that pupils encounter the diversity within religious traditions rather than developing stereotypical assumptions based on single examples. One Muslim speaker cannot represent "Islam"; one Humanist cannot represent all non-religious worldviews. Teachers need to address this explicitly with pupils, helping them understand that they are encountering particular perspectives within broader traditions.

Over time, curricula should aim for pupils to encounter multiple voices from the same tradition—different denominations, theological perspectives, cultural expressions, and individual interpretations. Where this is not possible within a single school, teachers can use video resources, written testimonies, and comparative discussion to convey diversity. When inviting speakers, schools might consider how different visitors over time can cumulatively represent the range within traditions.


## Local Faith Community Engagement

### Building Sustainable Partnerships

Beyond individual visits and speaker sessions, RE benefits from sustained partnerships between schools and local faith communities. These relationships provide ongoing resources for the curriculum, contribute to community cohesion, and model the mutual respect and cooperation that RE seeks to promote.

Building such partnerships requires investment of time and relationship-building. Religious communities vary enormously in their capacity and willingness to engage with schools. Some have well-established education programmes; others may be protective of their communities or lack resources for external engagement. Teachers need to approach potential partners with sensitivity, respect, and clarity about mutual benefits.

**Reciprocal benefits** should be acknowledged. Schools gain access to expertise, authentic perspectives, and experiential learning opportunities. Faith communities gain opportunities to contribute to education, correct misconceptions about their traditions, and build positive relationships with younger generations. These partnerships work best when approached as genuine collaboration rather than extraction of resources.

**Diversity of local contexts** means that partnership models must be adapted to local circumstances. Schools in urban areas with diverse populations may have multiple faith communities within walking distance. Schools in rural or mono-cultural areas may need to travel further or rely more heavily on digital connections. The specific religious demographics of the locality shape both the opportunities for engagement and the curriculum needs—schools with significant populations from particular traditions may prioritise engagement with those communities while also ensuring exposure to others.

### Community Events and Interfaith Activities

Some schools develop more extensive community engagement through participation in interfaith events, festivals, and collaborative projects. These might include: school groups attending community celebrations such as Diwali, Eid, or Vaisakhi events; interfaith dialogue sessions bringing together pupils from different schools and backgrounds; joint community service projects involving multiple faith communities; and cultural exchanges that include but extend beyond specifically religious content.

Such activities can powerfully demonstrate the connections between religious education and lived community life. However, they require careful planning to ensure educational integrity. Attendance at a community festival can become merely entertainment if not framed by clear learning objectives and follow-up reflection. Interfaith dialogue requires preparation of participants and skilled facilitation to be meaningful rather than superficial.


## Practical Considerations and Risk Management

### Safeguarding and Safety

All visits and visitor arrangements must comply with school safeguarding policies. This includes appropriate adult-to-pupil ratios, DBS checks where required, risk assessments for off-site visits, and clear protocols for any concerns that arise. Teachers should ensure that host communities understand safeguarding expectations and that any volunteers working with pupils have appropriate clearance.

For visits to places of worship, standard off-site visit procedures apply: risk assessments covering transport, the venue itself, and activities undertaken; parental permission; appropriate supervision ratios; and emergency procedures. The specific characteristics of religious venues—such as separation of genders in some spaces, removal of shoes creating trip hazards, or the presence of lit candles—should be incorporated into risk assessments.

### Cost and Equity

A significant practical barrier to community engagement in RE is cost. Transport to places of worship, particularly for schools in rural areas or those serving disadvantaged communities, can be prohibitively expensive. Schools must consider equity of access, ensuring that financial constraints do not prevent pupils from benefiting from these experiences.

Strategies for managing cost include: local walking visits where possible; virtual tours and digital connections with faith communities; cluster arrangements where schools share transport costs; and seeking community funding or sponsorship. While digital alternatives cannot fully replace physical visits, they can provide valuable supplementary experiences and may be the only viable option in some circumstances.

### Managing Sensitive Issues

Community engagement in RE can raise sensitive issues that require careful handling. These include:

**Parental objections**: Some parents may object to their children visiting places of worship or hearing from speakers from particular traditions. Schools need clear policies for managing such objections, balancing respect for parental rights with the educational entitlement to broad RE. The DfE's non-statutory guidance clarifies that pupils cannot be withdrawn from RE, though the specific content of visits and speakers may require sensitivity to parental concerns.

**Religious sensitivities**: Different faith communities have different expectations and boundaries. What is appropriate in one tradition may be offensive in another. Teachers need to educate themselves about the specific protocols of communities they engage with and communicate these clearly to pupils.

**Political and controversial issues**: Engagement with faith communities can sometimes touch on controversial political issues, particularly in relation to Israel/Palestine, Kashmir, or other conflict zones. Teachers need to be prepared to navigate such issues with sensitivity, maintaining educational focus while acknowledging legitimate concerns.


## Progression Across Key Stages

### Early Years Foundation Stage

In the EYFS, encounters with faith communities should be sensory, experiential, and focused on building positive associations with diversity. Visits might include walking to a local church to look at the building from outside, having a visitor from a faith community read a story, or exploring artefacts through handling and play. The emphasis is on developing curiosity and positive attitudes rather than formal learning about religious traditions.

### Key Stage 1

At Key Stage 1, pupils can begin to engage more directly with faith communities, though visits should remain relatively short and focused. A visit to a single place of worship, with opportunities to observe, ask questions, and participate in simple activities, provides foundational experience. Guest speakers should be chosen for their ability to communicate with young children, using stories and concrete examples rather than abstract theology.

### Key Stage 2

Key Stage 2 sees increasing sophistication in community engagement. Pupils can visit multiple places of worship, making comparisons between traditions. They can engage in more extended dialogue with speakers, asking questions that reflect their growing understanding. Projects involving sustained engagement with local faith communities—such as interviewing community members or documenting local religious heritage—become viable.

### Key Stage 3

At Key Stage 3, community engagement should support the more analytical approach to RE that characterises this phase. Visits and speakers should be framed by enquiry questions that encourage critical thinking about religious practice and community life. Pupils might engage in more extended dialogue or debate with speakers, exploring different perspectives within traditions. Interfaith dialogue activities, bringing together pupils from different backgrounds, can be particularly valuable at this stage.

### Key Stage 4 and Beyond

At GCSE and A-Level, community engagement supports the study of specific traditions in depth. Visits and speakers should be selected to illuminate particular beliefs, practices, and ethical issues on the specification. Pupils can engage in sophisticated dialogue with faith practitioners, exploring interpretive questions and the relationship between religious texts and lived practice. For A-Level students, engagement with academic theologians, philosophers of religion, and ethical thinkers extends the range of community engagement beyond local faith communities to include scholarly perspectives.


## Assessment of Learning from Community Engagement

Assessing learning from visits and speakers presents particular challenges. Traditional written assessments may not capture the full range of learning that occurs through experiential encounters, and over-emphasis on assessment can distort the educational purpose of community engagement.

Effective assessment strategies include:

**Pre- and post-visit tasks**: Tasks completed before and after the encounter can demonstrate development of understanding. These might include concept maps, question generation, reflective writing, or comparative analysis.

**Alternative forms of expression**: Some pupils may articulate their learning more effectively through art, photography, video, oral presentation, or creative writing than through conventional academic writing.

**Process documentation**: Recording the process of engagement—planning, reflection during the visit, follow-up discussion—can demonstrate learning about how to engage respectfully with faith communities, not just what was learned about specific traditions.

**Integration with broader assessment**: Learning from community engagement should be integrated with broader assessment of RE, recognising that these experiences contribute to the development of religious literacy, interpretive skills, and empathetic understanding that are central to the subject.


## Conclusion: Community Engagement as Core RE Pedagogy

Community engagement through visits to places of worship, guest speakers, and sustained partnerships with local faith communities is not an optional extra in RE but a core component of high-quality provision. The theoretical foundations in experiential learning, hermeneutical pedagogy, and education for diversity establish clear educational rationales for these practices. The practical guidance on planning, conduct, and risk management enables teachers to implement them safely and effectively. The progression frameworks ensure that encounters are developmentally appropriate across all key stages.

Ofsted's findings that the most effective RE involves carefully planned encounters with living faith communities, combined with its concerns about generalised teaching where such encounters are absent, should prompt all RE teachers to review and develop their community engagement practice. NATRE's ongoing advocacy and the practical resources provided by the RE Council and other professional bodies offer support for this development.

In an increasingly diverse society, the capacity to engage respectfully and knowledgeably with people from different religious and non-religious backgrounds is an essential educational outcome. RE, through well-planned community engagement, makes a distinctive contribution to developing this capacity. The investment of time and effort required to build relationships with faith communities, plan effective visits, and integrate experiential learning into the curriculum pays dividends in pupils' understanding, attitudes, and skills—outcomes that serve them well beyond their school years in navigating the complex religious landscape of contemporary Britain.
