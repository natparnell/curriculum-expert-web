# Dialogue and Debate in Religious Education

This knowledge file explores dialogical pedagogical approaches in Religious Education (RE), focusing on Philosophy for Children (P4C), Socratic questioning techniques, dialogical RE methodologies, and strategies for handling controversial issues in the classroom. These approaches share a commitment to student-centred learning, critical thinking, and the development of reasoned dialogue across difference.

## Philosophy for Children (P4C) in RE

### Origins and Theoretical Foundations

Philosophy for Children (P4C) was developed by **Professor Matthew Lipman** at Montclair State University in New Jersey during the 1970s. Influenced by American pragmatist philosophers **Charles Sanders Peirce** and **John Dewey**, Lipman envisaged the "community of inquiry"—a caring yet critical and creative group of collaborators in dialogue. Lipman believed that young children possess the tools needed to think rationally and that philosophical thinking could be nurtured through structured dialogue.

The Philosophy Foundation, which promotes P4C in the UK, emphasises that when we do philosophy with children it is 'P4C', but the methodology can extend to philosophy with adults ('P4A') and indeed anyone ('P4X'). This reflects the fundamental principle that philosophical inquiry is not age-restricted but rather a mode of thinking accessible to all when appropriately scaffolded.

### The Community of Inquiry

At the heart of P4C lies the **community of inquiry**—a structured approach to classroom dialogue that emphasises:

- **Collaborative thinking**: Students work together to explore questions and develop understanding
- **Caring thinking**: Participants listen respectfully and respond thoughtfully to each other's contributions
- **Critical thinking**: Students evaluate arguments, identify assumptions, and consider alternative perspectives
- **Creative thinking**: Participants generate new ideas, imagine possibilities, and think divergently

The community of inquiry creates a space where students feel safe to express tentative ideas, challenge assumptions, and revise their thinking in response to others. This aligns closely with the aims of RE, where pupils encounter diverse beliefs and worldviews and must learn to navigate difference with intellectual humility and respect.

### Implementing P4C in RE

Smannell and Enham Primary School has effectively integrated Philosophy for Children within RE, implementing an innovative cycle of learning which lies at the heart of the syllabus. The Religious Education Council of England and Wales recognises this approach as exemplary practice, demonstrating how P4C can enhance pupils' engagement with religious and philosophical questions.

**Key elements of P4C in RE include:**

1. **Stimulus materials**: Using religious stories, artefacts, images, or ethical dilemmas as starting points for philosophical inquiry
2. **Question generation**: Encouraging pupils to formulate their own philosophical questions arising from the stimulus
3. **Voting and agenda-setting**: Democratically selecting which question to explore
4. **Facilitated discussion**: The teacher acts as facilitator rather than knowledge-giver, supporting pupils to build on each other's ideas
5. **Reflection and review**: Concluding with metacognitive reflection on the quality of thinking and dialogue

### Benefits of P4C for RE

Research and practitioner experience suggest multiple benefits of integrating P4C into RE:

- **Enhanced engagement**: Pupils who may disengage from traditional RE often thrive in P4C sessions where their questions and ideas are central
- **Improved oracy**: Regular philosophical dialogue develops pupils' ability to articulate complex ideas and respond to others
- **Critical thinking**: P4C cultivates the ability to identify assumptions, evaluate arguments, and recognise logical fallacies
- **Moral reasoning**: Exploring ethical questions through dialogue supports the development of principled moral thinking
- **Interfaith understanding**: Dialogical approaches help pupils understand how people from different traditions might approach the same philosophical questions

## Socratic Questioning in Religious Education

### The Socratic Method

The Socratic method, named after the Greek philosopher **Socrates** (469–399 BC), is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue that stimulates critical thinking and draws out ideas and underlying presumptions. Rather than transmitting knowledge, the Socratic teacher uses probing questions to help students examine their beliefs and develop more nuanced understanding.

Reich (2001), recipient of the Walter J. Gores Award for Teaching Excellence, describes four essential components of the Socratic method:

1. **Systematic questioning**: The teacher poses questions that probe students' reasoning and assumptions
2. **Intellectual humility**: Participants acknowledge the limits of their knowledge and remain open to revision
3. **Active listening**: Students engage deeply with each other's contributions rather than simply waiting their turn
4. **Collaborative inquiry**: The group works together to explore complex questions without predetermined answers

### Types of Socratic Questions

**Clarification questions** help students articulate their thinking more precisely:
- What do you mean by that?
- Can you give an example?
- How does that relate to what we were discussing?

**Assumption questions** probe the foundations of students' arguments:
- What are you assuming?
- What could we assume instead?
- Is that always the case?

**Evidence and reasoning questions** examine the basis for claims:
- What evidence supports that view?
- How did you reach that conclusion?
- What would convince you otherwise?

**Viewpoint questions** encourage consideration of alternative perspectives:
- How might someone from a different background see this?
- What would a religious believer say about this?
- Is there another way to interpret this?

**Implication questions** explore consequences and connections:
- What follows from what you are saying?
- How does this affect our understanding of...?
- What are the wider implications?

### Socratic Seminar Structure

The **Socratic seminar** is a structured format for implementing Socratic questioning in the classroom. In RE, this approach proves particularly valuable for exploring religious texts, ethical dilemmas, and theological questions.

**Preparation phase**: Students engage with stimulus material—perhaps a passage from scripture, a case study, or an ethical scenario. They annotate the material, noting questions, observations, and points of interest.

**Inner circle discussion**: In the classic fishbowl format, an inner circle of students engages in dialogue while an outer circle observes. The inner circle discusses open-ended questions posed by the facilitator, building on each other's contributions and exploring multiple perspectives.

**Outer circle observation**: Students in the outer circle track the discussion, noting effective contributions, asking clarifying questions, and preparing to join the dialogue.

**Rotation and debrief**: Participants rotate between inner and outer circles, ensuring all have opportunity to contribute. The session concludes with reflection on both the content discussed and the quality of dialogue.

### Socratic Questioning in Practice

In RE classrooms, Socratic questioning might be used to:

- Explore the problem of evil by probing students' assumptions about divine omnipotence and benevolence
- Examine religious perspectives on ethical issues by questioning how different traditions arrive at moral conclusions
- Investigate the nature of religious belief by probing what it means to "believe" something and how belief differs from knowledge
- Consider the relationship between science and religion by questioning assumptions about the compatibility of these ways of knowing

The teacher's role is to maintain intellectual rigour while ensuring the discussion remains respectful and inclusive of diverse perspectives.

## Dialogical RE: The Interpretive Approach

### Robert Jackson's Dialogical Framework

**Professor Robert Jackson** of the University of Warwick has been instrumental in developing dialogical approaches to RE through his **Interpretive Approach**. Jackson argues that RE should be seen as a forum for discussion whereby students are encouraged to engage critically but sensitively in key debates about religion and culture.

The Interpretive Approach rests on three key concepts:

**Representation**: Acknowledging that religions are internally diverse and that any representation is selective and interpretive. Teachers must help pupils recognise that they are encountering particular representations of religious traditions rather than comprehensive accounts.

**Interpretation**: Understanding that religious beliefs and practices are always interpreted—by believers themselves, by scholars, and by students in the classroom. This interpretive dimension is unavoidable and should be made explicit.

**Reflexivity**: Encouraging students to reflect on their own positions, assumptions, and responses to the material they encounter. This includes considering how their own backgrounds shape their understanding of religious phenomena.

### Pupil-to-Pupil Dialogue

Building on Jackson's work, **Julia Ipgrave** (2001, 2002) developed approaches to **pupil-to-pupil dialogue** in RE. Her research demonstrates how structured dialogue between students from different religious backgrounds can deepen understanding and foster mutual respect.

Key principles of pupil-to-pupil dialogue include:

- **Creating safe spaces**: Establishing classroom norms that enable honest expression without fear of judgment
- **Structured encounters**: Designing activities that bring students into genuine dialogue about questions that matter to them
- **Respecting difference**: Acknowledging that disagreement is natural and can be productive when handled respectfully
- **Shared inquiry**: Focusing on questions that all participants can explore together, regardless of their starting points

### Dialogical RE in Practice

The dialogical approach transforms the RE classroom from a space of information transmission to one of collaborative meaning-making. Rather than learning about religions as static systems of belief, pupils engage with living traditions through dialogue.

**Practical applications include:**

- **Scripture circles**: Small groups explore sacred texts together, sharing interpretations and questioning meanings
- **Interfaith panels**: Students research and represent different religious perspectives on shared questions
- **Ethical deliberation**: Structured discussion of moral dilemmas using dialogical protocols
- **Worldview comparison**: Exploring how different traditions address fundamental human questions

The Norwegian RE curriculum exemplifies this approach, framing the development of ethical reflection and the practice of considering multiple perspectives as central aims. Students participate in ethical reflection and develop their ability to handle challenging questions while remaining open to the views of others in a diverse society.

## Handling Controversial Issues in RE

### Understanding Controversy in RE

Religious Education inevitably engages with controversial issues. Research published in *Religions* (2020) identifies several areas commonly regarded as controversial in diverse RE classrooms:

- **Divergent interpretations of religious narratives**: How different groups understand the same sacred texts
- **Religiously motivated rules**: Practices around dress, diet, gender roles, and behaviour
- **Religious holidays and observances**: Questions of participation, recognition, and meaning
- **Views of forgiveness and justice**: Different religious perspectives on reconciliation and punishment
- **The Israeli–Palestinian conflict**: A perennial source of classroom tension
- **Abortion and beginning of life ethics**: Divergent views on sanctity of life

The RE Council and professional bodies recognise that the ability to handle controversial issues constructively is a core professional competency for RE teachers.

### Creating a Dialogical Space

Academic research emphasises that **a dialogical space must be created for concerns to be voiced and heard**. This involves:

**Establishing ground rules**: Before engaging with controversial topics, classes should co-create norms for respectful dialogue. These might include:
- Listening to understand, not just to respond
- Speaking from personal experience using "I" statements
- Respecting confidentiality—what is shared in class stays in class
- Challenging ideas, not people

**Knowing your students**: Harvard Graduate School of Education research stresses the importance of understanding your students and the community context before teaching controversial issues. Teachers must be aware of the diverse perspectives and potential sensitivities within their classroom.

**Classroom arrangement and management**: Physical setup matters. Desk arrangements should facilitate face-to-face dialogue. Teachers must manage transitions between activities carefully and ensure all students are prepared for the discussion.

### Pedagogical Strategies for Controversial Issues

**The structured controversy approach**: Rather than debating opposing sides in a competitive format, students work in groups to understand multiple perspectives on an issue. Each group synthesises the strongest arguments from all sides before reaching their own conclusions.

**The believing and doubting game**: Students first "believe" a position—attempting to understand and articulate it sympathetically—before "doubting" it through critical questioning. This builds intellectual empathy alongside critical thinking.

**Forum Theatre**: Research published in *Journal of Religious Education* (2023) demonstrates how Forum Theatre can address controversial issues by enacting and rehearsing democracy. Students dramatise scenarios involving conflict or controversy, with the audience intervening to change outcomes. This approach is particularly valuable in RE, where ethical reflection and the practice of considering multiple perspectives are curriculum aims.

**Multiple perspectives protocol**: A structured approach where students:
1. Encounter a controversial issue through neutral stimulus material
2. Identify the range of perspectives held by different stakeholders
3. Research how religious and non-religious worldviews inform these positions
4. Engage in structured dialogue exploring these perspectives
5. Reflect on their own developing thinking

### The Teacher's Role

Research on teaching controversial issues highlights the complexity of the teacher's position. Teachers must:

- **Maintain neutrality**: While sharing their own perspectives can be appropriate, teachers must avoid imposing their views or creating pressure to conform
- **Facilitate rather than direct**: The teacher's role is to support students in exploring issues, not to provide the "right" answer
- **Manage emotions**: Controversial issues can trigger strong feelings; teachers must recognise and respond appropriately
- **Ensure balanced representation**: Multiple perspectives must be presented fairly, without distortion or caricature
- **Know when to pause**: Sometimes discussions become too heated or move beyond students' readiness; skilled teachers recognise when to table a discussion for another day

### Legal and Professional Framework

In England and Wales, RE teachers operate within a legal framework that supports the open discussion of controversial issues. The non-statutory nature of much RE content allows flexibility in curriculum design, while the requirement for balanced teaching ensures diverse perspectives are represented.

The RE Council's National Content Standard for RE (2023) provides benchmarking for curricula, content, pedagogy, and provision. While not prescriptive, it establishes expectations for high-quality RE that includes engagement with controversial questions.

Teachers should also be aware of their school's policies on controversial issues and ensure their practice aligns with both professional standards and institutional expectations.

## Integrating Approaches: A Unified Pedagogical Framework

### Common Threads

P4C, Socratic questioning, dialogical RE, and strategies for handling controversial issues share several foundational principles:

**Student-centred learning**: All approaches position students as active meaning-makers rather than passive recipients of information. The teacher facilitates rather than directs.

**Collaborative inquiry**: Learning happens through dialogue and interaction. The social construction of knowledge is foregrounded.

**Critical thinking**: Students are supported to examine assumptions, evaluate evidence, and consider multiple perspectives.

**Respectful disagreement**: All approaches recognise that disagreement is natural and can be productive when handled with intellectual humility and care for others.

**Metacognitive reflection**: Students are encouraged to think about their own thinking—recognising how they arrive at conclusions and how they might revise their views.

### Progressive Skill Development

Across key stages, dialogical approaches in RE should develop increasing sophistication:

**Key Stage 1**: Pupils participate in simple philosophical discussions, learning to listen to others and take turns. They encounter diverse perspectives through stories and begin to recognise that people think differently.

**Key Stage 2**: Pupils engage in more structured philosophical inquiry, generating their own questions and building on each other's ideas. They begin to identify assumptions and offer reasons for their views.

**Key Stage 3**: Pupils participate in full Socratic seminars, examining complex religious and ethical questions through sustained dialogue. They develop skill in representing perspectives other than their own.

**Key Stage 4**: Pupils engage with controversial issues using structured protocols, recognising the complexity of ethical reasoning and the validity of different approaches. They demonstrate reflexivity about their own positions.

**Key Stage 5**: Advanced philosophical inquiry, independent research, and the facilitation of dialogue with younger students. Sixth formers might lead P4C enquiries or Socratic seminars.

### Assessment of Dialogical Skills

Assessing dialogical competencies presents challenges, as traditional written assessment cannot capture the quality of live dialogue. Alternative approaches include:

- **Structured observation**: Teachers use rubrics to assess participation in seminars against criteria such as quality of questioning, responsiveness to others, and depth of thinking
- **Reflective journals**: Students maintain written reflections on their contributions to dialogues and their developing understanding
- **Self and peer assessment**: Students evaluate their own and others' contributions using agreed criteria
- **Video analysis**: Recorded discussions can be reviewed for assessment purposes and to support student reflection

### Implementation Challenges and Solutions

**Time constraints**: Dialogical approaches require extended discussion time that may conflict with packed curricula. Solutions include:
- Integrating dialogue into existing RE topics rather than treating it as an add-on
- Using cross-curricular time for sustained philosophical inquiry
- Developing "philosophy mornings" or collapsed timetable days for deeper exploration

**Classroom management**: Open dialogue can feel risky for teachers concerned about maintaining control. Solutions include:
- Establishing clear protocols and ground rules
- Using structured formats like fishbowl that provide natural boundaries
- Building gradually—start with shorter, more structured dialogues before attempting extended inquiry

**Assessment pressures**: When success is measured through written examination, investing time in dialogical approaches may seem risky. Solutions include:
- Recognising that dialogical skills underpin examination performance
- Ensuring dialogue leads to written reflection and consolidation
- Articulating the value of oracy and critical thinking to school leadership

## Conclusion

Dialogue and debate lie at the heart of meaningful Religious Education. Through Philosophy for Children, Socratic questioning, dialogical RE approaches, and carefully structured engagement with controversial issues, pupils develop the intellectual and interpersonal capacities needed to navigate a religiously diverse world.

These pedagogical approaches are not merely methodological choices but reflect fundamental values about the nature of knowledge, the importance of democratic discourse, and the dignity of the learner as a thinking being. In an era of polarisation and echo chambers, the RE classroom as a space of respectful dialogue across difference has never been more vital.

Teachers implementing these approaches should remember that dialogue is a skill developed through practice. The quality of classroom dialogue improves over time as students and teachers become more comfortable with the norms of philosophical inquiry. Patience, persistence, and a genuine commitment to hearing students' voices will yield transformative educational experiences.

## Practical Examples for the RE Classroom

### Example 1: P4C Enquiry on the Problem of Evil

A Year 8 class begins with a stimulus—a short video clip showing natural disaster footage followed by an interview with a religious believer discussing their faith. Students generate philosophical questions:

- "Why does God allow suffering?"
- "Can you believe in God and accept evolution?"
- "Is suffering necessary for human growth?"

The class votes to explore the first question. The teacher facilitates as students share perspectives from religious and non-religious viewpoints. The enquiry concludes with students reflecting on how their thinking has developed.

### Example 2: Socratic Seminar on Religious Authority

A Year 10 class engages in a Socratic seminar examining the question: "Should religious texts be interpreted literally?"

The inner circle discusses, drawing on examples from Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. The outer circle tracks contributions using a structured observation sheet. After twenty minutes, the circles swap. The session concludes with the class identifying the strongest arguments presented and the most significant points of disagreement.

### Example 3: Handling Controversy Through Structured Dialogue

A Year 9 class explores perspectives on same-sex relationships across religious traditions. Rather than debating the moral question directly, students:

1. Research how different Christian denominations approach the issue
2. Identify the theological reasoning behind each position
3. Engage in a "believing and doubting" exercise, first articulating each perspective sympathetically, then questioning it critically
4. Reflect on their own assumptions about the relationship between religious belief and ethical positions

This approach enables rigorous engagement with a controversial topic while maintaining respect for diverse viewpoints and avoiding simplistic moralising.

### Example 4: Pupil-to-Pupil Dialogue Across Difference

In a school with significant religious diversity, Year 7 students from different faith backgrounds engage in structured dialogue about prayer. Using Julia Ipgrave's approach, the activity is structured in three phases:

**Phase 1**: Students prepare by reflecting on their own experience of prayer (or absence of prayer) in their families and communities.

**Phase 2**: In mixed-faith pairs, students share their perspectives using structured protocols: "In my tradition..." and "I find it interesting that you..."

**Phase 3**: The whole class discusses what they learned about prayer across traditions, identifying commonalities and differences.

This approach builds religious literacy while fostering interfaith understanding and respect.

## Research Evidence and Impact

Empirical research supports the effectiveness of dialogical approaches in RE. Studies have demonstrated that:

- Students in P4C programmes show measurable gains in cognitive ability, with effects particularly pronounced for disadvantaged pupils (Education Endowment Foundation, 2015)
- Dialogical RE approaches improve students' ability to understand and represent perspectives different from their own (Jackson, 2004)
- Structured discussion of controversial issues develops students' capacity for democratic deliberation (Hess, 2009)
- Oracy-focused pedagogies improve academic outcomes across the curriculum, not just in RE (Alexander, 2017)

These findings suggest that investment in dialogical pedagogy yields returns beyond RE, contributing to whole-school priorities around literacy, critical thinking, and personal development.

## Professional Development for Teachers

Implementing dialogical approaches effectively requires ongoing professional development. Teachers benefit from:

- **Observation of expert practitioners**: Watching experienced facilitators conduct P4C enquiries or Socratic seminars reveals the subtle art of questioning and redirecting
- **Practice with peer groups**: Teachers themselves should experience dialogical approaches as learners before attempting to facilitate them
- **Reflective video analysis**: Recording and reviewing one's own facilitation enables identification of growth areas
- **Engagement with the research literature**: Understanding the theoretical foundations strengthens practice

Professional organisations such as SAPERE (the UK charity promoting P4C) and the RE Council offer training and resources for teachers seeking to develop their dialogical practice.
