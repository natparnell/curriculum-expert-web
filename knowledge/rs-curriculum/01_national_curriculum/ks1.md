# Key Stage 1 Religious Education: Statutory Requirements

## Introduction

Religious Education (RE) at Key Stage 1 forms part of the basic curriculum for all maintained schools in England, required by law but not part of the National Curriculum. The statutory requirements for RE are determined locally through Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education (SACREs), which produce Locally Agreed Syllabuses. However, national guidance from the Religious Education Council of England and Wales (REC) and the National Association of Teachers of Religious Education (NATRE) provides frameworks that inform these local syllabuses and support consistency in RE provision across the country.

Key Stage 1 RE, encompassing Years 1 and 2 (pupils aged 5-7), provides the foundation for children's understanding of religious and non-religious worldviews. During these crucial early years, pupils begin to explore questions of meaning, purpose, and value that will be developed throughout their education. The approach at Key Stage 1 is characterised by exploration, discovery, and the development of curiosity about the world and the diversity of beliefs and practices within it.

This document examines the statutory framework for Key Stage 1 RE, drawing upon the National Curriculum statutory guidance for RE, the REC's "Religious Education: A Curriculum Framework" (2013), and "Understanding Christianity" resources. It addresses the legal requirements, the nature of RE at this Key Stage, approaches to teaching, and the development of pupils' religious literacy.

## The Statutory Framework for RE

### Legal Requirements

RE is a statutory subject for all registered pupils in maintained schools in England, with the following key provisions:

**All maintained schools must**:
- Teach RE to all pupils, unless withdrawn by their parents
- Follow their Locally Agreed Syllabus (community schools) or the syllabus of their faith designation (faith schools)
- Provide RE that is "in the main Christian, whilst taking account of the teaching and practices of the other principal religions represented in Great Britain"

**Key Stage 1 specifically**:
- Pupils in Years 1 and 2 (ages 5-7) must receive RE as part of their basic curriculum
- There is no prescribed amount of time, though good practice suggests approximately 36 hours of RE per year (equivalent to about one hour per week)
- The content is determined by the Locally Agreed Syllabus, which must be consistent with national guidance

### Locally Agreed Syllabuses

Each local authority (through its SACRE) maintains a Locally Agreed Syllabus for RE. These syllabuses:

- Set out the requirements for RE in schools under that local authority's jurisdiction
- Must be reviewed every five years
- Should reflect the religious traditions represented in the local area
- Must be consistent with national guidance while allowing for local flexibility

The content and structure of RE varies somewhat between local authorities, but most syllabuses follow similar patterns influenced by national frameworks.

### National Guidance

While RE is locally determined, national guidance provides coherence:

**The Religious Education Council (REC)** published "Religious Education: A Curriculum Framework" in 2013, which provides guidance on the aims, content, and standards for RE. This framework suggests:

- A broad and balanced curriculum reflecting the diversity of religious and non-religious worldviews
- Systematic study of specific traditions alongside thematic exploration
- Development of religious literacy and the skills to engage with religious questions

**Understanding Christianity**, a resource developed by Church of England Education Office and RE Today, provides a substantial approach to teaching Christianity, which should form the majority of RE content in Church of England schools and a significant component in community schools.

## The Nature of RE at Key Stage 1

### Age-Appropriate Approaches

RE at Key Stage 1 must be appropriate to the developmental stage of 5-7 year olds:

**Concrete experiences**: Young children learn best through direct experience, sensory engagement, and concrete examples rather than abstract concepts.

**Stories and narratives**: Stories from religious traditions provide accessible entry points for young children, conveying values, beliefs, and practices through narrative.

**Exploration and questioning**: RE should foster curiosity and questioning, encouraging children to explore and express their own ideas and responses.

**Respect and openness**: Teaching should model respect for diversity while maintaining openness about different beliefs and practices.

### Core Themes at Key Stage 1

Key Stage 1 RE typically explores themes such as:

**Belonging**: Exploring what it means to belong to a family, community, or religious tradition; ceremonies that mark belonging (naming ceremonies, initiation rites).

**Special times**: Exploring festivals and celebrations, their meanings, and how they are marked in different traditions.

**Special places**: Exploring places of worship and their significance; sacred spaces and what makes them special.

**Special stories**: Exploring stories from religious texts and oral traditions; what they mean to believers and what they teach.

**Special people**: Exploring religious leaders, prophets, and exemplars; their lives and teachings.

**Special things**: Exploring religious artefacts, symbols, and objects; their meanings and uses.

**Big questions**: Beginning to explore questions about meaning, purpose, and value; what different people believe and why.

## The Principal Religions

### Christianity

Christianity should receive the most attention in Key Stage 1 RE, reflecting the statutory requirement that RE be "in the main Christian." Areas of study typically include:

**Jesus Christ**: Stories from Jesus' life and teaching; what Christians believe about Jesus; how Jesus is a model for Christian living.

**God**: Christian beliefs about God as creator, loving parent, and Trinity (introduced simply); prayer and worship.

**The Bible**: The Christian sacred text; stories from the Old and New Testaments; how the Bible is used by Christians.

**Christian life**: How Christians live their faith; belonging to a church community; Christian values and how they are expressed.

**Christian festivals**: Christmas and Easter as the major festivals; their meanings and how they are celebrated.

### Islam

Study of Islam at Key Stage 1 typically includes:

**Allah and the Prophet Muhammad**: Basic beliefs about God and the significance of Muhammad as the final prophet.

**The Qur'an**: The Muslim holy book; its importance and how it is treated with reverence.

**The Five Pillars**: Introduction to the basic practices of Islam (declaration of faith, prayer, charity, fasting, pilgrimage) in age-appropriate ways.

**Muslim life**: How Muslim families live their faith; the mosque as a place of worship; Friday prayer and community.

**Ramadan and Eid**: The significance of the month of fasting and the celebration that follows; how children participate.

### Judaism

Study of Judaism at Key Stage 1 typically includes:

**God and the covenant**: Basic understanding of the special relationship between God and the Jewish people.

**The Torah**: The Jewish sacred text; its importance and how it is treated; stories from the Torah.

### Non-Religious Worldviews

In addition to religious traditions, RE at Key Stage 1 should include reference to non-religious worldviews, including:

**Humanism**: The belief that people can be good without religion; humanist values and ethics.

**Different ways of living**: Recognition that not everyone has religious beliefs; respect for different ways of understanding the world.

**Questions and meaning**: How people without religious beliefs find meaning and purpose.

The inclusion of non-religious worldviews reflects the diversity of contemporary society and ensures that RE is genuinely inclusive.

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Learning from Religion and Learning about Religion

Effective RE at Key Stage 1 involves both:

**Learning about religion**: Developing knowledge and understanding of religious beliefs, practices, and traditions. This includes knowing the stories, understanding the festivals, and recognising the symbols.

**Learning from religion**: Reflecting on religious beliefs and practices in relation to one's own experience and developing personal responses. This includes considering what stories mean, what values are important, and how people make decisions.

Both dimensions are essential. Learning about religion without reflection becomes merely factual; learning from religion without knowledge lacks foundation.

### Teaching Strategies

Effective strategies for teaching RE at Key Stage 1 include:

**Storytelling**: Using religious stories to engage imagination and convey values; inviting visitors to tell stories from their traditions.

**Handling artefacts**: Providing opportunities to explore religious objects, asking questions about what they are, how they are used, and what they mean.

**Visits and visitors**: Visiting places of worship where possible; inviting religious practitioners and believers to share their experiences.

**Role play and drama**: Enacting religious stories and ceremonies to deepen understanding and empathy.

**Art and creative expression**: Using art, music, and movement to explore religious themes and express responses.

**Discussion and questioning**: Encouraging children to ask questions and express their thoughts; creating safe spaces for exploring ideas.

**Making connections**: Linking RE to other areas of the curriculum, particularly PSHE, literacy, and the arts.

### Addressing Controversy

While Key Stage 1 RE generally avoids highly controversial topics, teachers should be prepared to:

- Acknowledge different viewpoints respectfully
- Avoid presenting any one tradition as "the truth" while others are "stories"
- Be sensitive to the diverse backgrounds of pupils in the class
- Create an inclusive environment where all pupils feel valued

## Assessment in Key Stage 1 RE

### Formative Assessment

Ongoing assessment in Key Stage 1 RE focuses on:

- **Knowledge and understanding**: Can pupils recall key facts about religious traditions? Can they describe practices and beliefs?
- **Explanation**: Can pupils explain what religious people believe and do?
- **Reflection**: Can pupils express their own thoughts and responses to religious questions?
- **Respect and openness**: Do pupils show respect for different beliefs and practices?

Assessment is typically informal, based on observation, discussion, and children's work.

### Recording Progress

Schools may track progress through:

- **Learning journals**: Recording children's reflections and responses over time
- **Portfolios**: Collecting examples of work that demonstrate learning
- **Can-do statements**: Checking whether children can demonstrate particular capabilities

There are no national standards or levels for RE, though some locally agreed syllabuses provide assessment frameworks.

## The Role of the Teacher

### Subject Knowledge

Effective RE teaching requires:

- Accurate knowledge of the religious traditions being taught
- Awareness of the diversity within traditions
- Understanding of common misconceptions and how to address them
- Sensitivity to the beliefs and backgrounds of pupils

Teachers are not expected to be experts in all religious traditions, but they should ensure that their teaching is accurate and respectful. Resources such as "Understanding Christianity" and materials from RE Today provide reliable information and teaching ideas.

### Creating an Inclusive Environment

Key Stage 1 RE should create an environment where:

- All pupils feel valued, whatever their background or beliefs
- Questions are welcomed and explored
- Diversity is celebrated
- Stereotypes are challenged
- Respect is modelled by the teacher

This requires sensitivity to the composition of the class and awareness of how different children may experience RE.

### Working with Parents and Communities

Engaging with parents and communities enriches RE:

- Parents may be invited to share their beliefs and practices
- Community members may visit to talk about their faith
- Places of worship may welcome school visits
- Festivals may be celebrated with the involvement of families

Such engagement helps to make RE relevant and authentic while also building community connections.

## Resources for Key Stage 1 RE

### Published Resources

**Understanding Christianity**: A comprehensive resource for teaching Christianity, produced by the Church of England Education Office and RE Today.

**RE Today**: Publisher of resources, magazines, and teaching materials for RE at all key stages.

**The Stapleford Centre**: Provides resources and training for RE, including materials for exploring Christianity and other faiths.

**Local agreed syllabuses**: Most local authorities provide support materials to accompany their syllabuses.

### Online Resources

- **NATRE (National Association of Teachers of Religious Education)**: Professional association providing resources, training, and support
- **RE:Online**: Portal for RE resources and information
- **BBC Bitesize**: Age-appropriate materials on religious traditions
- **Truetube**: Video resources exploring religious and ethical questions

### Places of Worship

Many places of worship offer educational visits and resources:

- Churches, mosques, gurdwaras, mandirs, and synagogues often welcome school visits
- Some have dedicated education officers
- Virtual visits may be available where physical visits are not possible

## Transition to Key Stage 2

### Building Foundations

Key Stage 1 RE lays foundations for more systematic study at Key Stage 2:

- Knowledge of key stories, festivals, and practices provides the basis for deeper study
- Developed curiosity and questioning skills support more complex enquiry
- Experience of respectful exploration of diversity prepares pupils for studying multiple traditions

### Continuity and Progression

Effective transition requires:

- Building on what pupils have learned in Key Stage 1
- Ensuring progression in complexity and depth
- Maintaining the exploratory, enquiry-based approach that characterises good RE
- Providing opportunities for pupils to revisit and deepen their understanding

### Challenges

Challenges at transition include:

- Varied prior experience if pupils have come from different schools
- Ensuring that pupils who did not experience high-quality KS1 RE are not disadvantaged
- Balancing systematic study of specific traditions with thematic exploration

## Conclusion

Religious Education at Key Stage 1 provides the foundation for pupils' understanding of religious and non-religious worldviews. Through exploration of stories, festivals, beliefs, and practices, pupils develop both knowledge about religion and the skills to engage with questions of meaning, purpose, and value.

The statutory requirement for RE ensures that all pupils have the opportunity to learn about the diversity of beliefs and practices in Britain and beyond. While the content is determined locally through agreed syllabuses, national guidance provides coherence and ensures that RE is educationally rigorous.

Effective Key Stage 1 RE is characterised by age-appropriate approaches that engage young children's curiosity, foster respect for diversity, and lay the foundations for more systematic study in later years. Through stories, artefacts, visits, and creative activities, pupils encounter the richness of religious and non-religious worldviews, developing the religious literacy that will serve them throughout their lives.

As society becomes increasingly diverse and as questions of belief, identity, and values continue to be significant, the role of RE in primary education remains essential. By providing children with the knowledge, understanding, and skills to engage with religious and ethical questions, Key Stage 1 RE contributes to their development as informed, respectful, and thoughtful citizens.
