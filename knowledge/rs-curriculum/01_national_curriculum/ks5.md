# Key Stage 5: A Level Religious Studies

## Overview and Purpose

A Level Religious Studies represents a significant intellectual step up from GCSE, offering students the opportunity to engage with complex philosophical, ethical, and theological questions at a university-preparatory level. The subject develops sophisticated reasoning skills, critical analysis capabilities, and the ability to construct extended evaluative arguments—attributes highly valued in higher education and professional contexts regardless of disciplinary specialism.

The Ofsted research review for Religious Education (May 2021) emphasises that high-quality RE at all stages enables pupils to take their place within a diverse multi-religious and multi-secular society. At A Level, this manifests as rigorous academic study that combines three distinct disciplinary approaches: philosophy of religion, religion and ethics, and the study of specific religious traditions with their associated textual, theological, and practical dimensions.

Unlike many subjects where post-16 study builds incrementally upon GCSE foundations, A Level Religious Studies often introduces entirely new conceptual frameworks, disciplinary methodologies, and scholarly debates. The jump from GCSE to A Level is considerable, and effective transition programmes are essential for student success.

## Statutory and Regulatory Framework

### DfE Subject Content Requirements

The Department for Education's statutory subject content for AS and A Level Religious Studies (February 2015) establishes the minimum knowledge, skills, and understanding that students must develop. All awarding organisations must comply with this content, though they may structure their specifications differently and select which religions to include for in-depth study.

The DfE content specifies three core areas that must be addressed:

**Philosophy of Religion**
Students must study philosophical issues and questions arising from, or relevant to, religious belief and practice. This includes the influence of philosophy of religion on religious belief and practice, and how developments in religious beliefs and practices have influenced philosophy of religion. The approach of philosophy to the study of religion and belief must be understood, including the distinction between rational and empirical approaches.

**Religion and Ethics**
Students must study ethical issues and questions arising from, or relevant to, religious belief and practice. This includes how ethical language and thought have developed through significant concepts and the works of key thinkers. The influence of ethical thought on religious belief and practice must be explored, alongside the influence of religious belief and practice on ethical thought. The relationship between religion and ethics, including religious approaches to moral decision-making, forms a central component.

**Study of Religion**
Students must engage in systematic study of one or more religions, exploring religious beliefs, values, and teachings; sources of wisdom and authority; practices that shape and express religious identity; and significant social and historical developments in religious thought. The relationship between religion and society, including responses to pluralism and secularism, must also be addressed.

### Assessment Structure Across Awarding Bodies

Three awarding bodies offer A Level Religious Studies specifications that comply with DfE requirements:

**AQA (7062)**
- Component 1: Philosophy of Religion and Ethics (50%)
- Component 2: Study of Religion and Dialogues (50%)
Students choose one religion for focused study: Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, or Judaism

**OCR (H573)**
- Philosophy of Religion
- Religion and Ethics  
- Developments in Christian Thought (or alternative religious strands)

**Eduqas (A120P)**
- Component 1: Philosophy of Religion
- Component 2: Religion and Ethics
- Component 3: New Testament Studies (or alternative textual studies)

All specifications require students to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the meaning and significance of specified content, analyse and evaluate issues arising from topics studied, and use specialist language and terminology appropriately. Questions may span multiple topics, requiring synoptic thinking and the ability to draw connections across the curriculum.

## Philosophy of Religion

### Arguments for the Existence of God

The traditional arguments for God's existence represent foundational content in A Level Philosophy of Religion, requiring students to engage with sophisticated metaphysical reasoning and its limitations.

**The Teleological (Design) Argument**

Students typically study William Paley's analogical argument from design, presented in his 1802 work *Natural Theology*. Paley argues that just as a watch implies a watchmaker due to its intricate arrangement of parts serving a purpose, so too does the natural world imply a designer. The argument moves from observation of apparent purpose and regularity in nature to the inference of an intelligent cause.

Critical evaluation requires engagement with David Hume's objections, presented posthumously in his *Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion* (1779). Hume challenges the analogy between human artefacts and natural objects, questions whether we can legitimately infer a single designer rather than multiple designers, and suggests that the apparent imperfections in nature might indicate an imperfect designer. Hume also proposes alternative explanations, including the Epicurean hypothesis that chance and natural forces might account for apparent order.

Contemporary scientific developments, including evolutionary biology and cosmology, add further dimensions to evaluation. Richard Dawkins' argument from evolutionary complexity and the anthropic principle's challenge to design arguments require careful consideration.

**The Ontological Argument**

Anselm's a priori argument, first presented in his *Proslogion* (1077-78), attempts to prove God's existence from the concept of God alone. Anselm defines God as "that than which nothing greater can be conceived" and argues that such a being must exist in reality as well as in the understanding, since existence in reality is greater than existence in the understanding alone.

Students must evaluate Gaunilo's immediate response that the same reasoning would prove the existence of a perfect island, and Kant's more sophisticated critique that existence is not a predicate—that is, existence does not add to the greatness of a concept in the way that other properties do. Kant argues that "exists" functions differently from descriptive predicates like "wise" or "powerful."

**The Cosmological Argument**

Thomas Aquinas' Third Way (argument from contingency and necessity), presented in his *Summa Theologica*, argues from the observation of contingent beings (things that might not exist) to the necessary existence of a first cause or ultimate explanation. The argument distinguishes between beings whose existence depends upon others and a being whose existence is self-sufficient.

Hume and Bertrand Russell offer influential criticisms. Hume questions whether we can infer a cause for the universe as a whole when we only observe causation within the universe. Russell argues that the universe might simply exist as a brute fact requiring no explanation. The debate connects to contemporary cosmology, including the Big Bang theory and theories of infinite regress.

### The Problem of Evil and Suffering

The problem of evil represents perhaps the most significant challenge to religious belief that students encounter. Both the logical problem (is the coexistence of God and evil logically possible?) and the evidential problem (does the quantity and distribution of evil make God's existence improbable?) must be addressed.

**Distinctions and Clarifications**

Students must distinguish between natural evil (suffering arising from natural processes such as disease, earthquakes, and genetic disorders) and moral evil (suffering resulting from human choices and actions). This distinction affects the applicability of different theodicies and defences.

**Major Responses**

John Hick's soul-making theodicy, developed in his work *Evil and the God of Love* (1966), argues that evil and suffering serve an educative purpose, enabling the development of moral and spiritual character. Drawing on Irenaeus rather than Augustine, Hick sees creation as an incomplete process in which humans are gradually perfected through their responses to challenge and suffering.

The free will defence, developed most thoroughly by Alvin Plantinga, argues that moral evil results from human free will, and that a world containing free creatures who sometimes choose wrongly is superior to a world of automata who always choose rightly. This defence addresses the logical problem but leaves questions about natural evil unanswered.

Process theodicy, associated with Charles Hartshorne and John Cobb, offers a more radical reconceptualisation by denying divine omnipotence in the traditional sense. On this view, God is not the unilateral controller of events but works persuasively within the evolutionary process. David Griffin's development of process theodicy provides resources for addressing both natural and moral evil.

### Religious Experience

The study of religious experience requires engagement with phenomenological description, psychological explanation, and philosophical evaluation of claims to encounter the divine.

**Typologies of Experience**

Students examine different classifications of religious experience:

*Visions* are categorised as corporeal (seeming to involve normal sense perception), imaginative (experienced in the mind's eye, comparable to dreams or memories), or intellectual (a direct apprehension of truth without sensory or imaginative content).

*Numinous experiences*, following Rudolf Otto's analysis in *The Idea of the Holy* (1917), involve apprehension of the "wholly other"—a mysterium tremendum et fascinans that simultaneously attracts and repels, evokes both awe and fascination.

*Mystical experiences*, studied through William James' *The Varieties of Religious Experience* (1902), are characterised by ineffability, noetic quality, transiency, and passivity. Walter Stace distinguishes between introvertive mysticism (union without content) and extrovertive mysticism (unity perceived in the external world).

**Verification and Evaluation**

Richard Swinburne's principles of credulity and testimony provide a framework for assessing claims to religious experience. The principle of credulity states that experiences are generally to be taken as veridical (truth-revealing) unless there is positive reason to doubt them. The principle of testimony holds that people's reports of their experiences are generally to be believed unless there are special reasons for doubt.

Challenges from science and alternative explanations—psychological, neurological, and sociological—require careful evaluation. The question of whether religious experiences can justify religious belief, and whether diversity of religious experiences undermines their evidential value, forms a central topic for debate.

### Religious Language

The cognitive status of religious language—whether religious statements make truth-claims that can be assessed as true or false—represents a foundational meta-philosophical issue.

**The Verification and Falsification Debates**

The logical positivists' verification principle, developed by A.J. Ayer and others, held that only statements capable of empirical verification are cognitively meaningful. Applied to religious language, this apparently renders statements about God meaningless since no empirical observations could verify or falsify them.

Responses include eschatological verification (John Hick's argument that religious claims may be verifiable in principle after death), R.M. Hare's concept of "bliks" (non-cognitive, unfalsifiable basic perspectives on the world), and Wittgenstein's language-game theory (religious language has meaning within the form of life in which it is used, but should not be judged by external criteria).

**Alternative Conceptions**

Paul Tillich's symbolic interpretation holds that religious language is symbolic rather than literal—it points beyond itself to ultimate concerns without being reducible to literal propositions. Thomas Aquinas' theory of analogy attempts to preserve meaningfulness while acknowledging the difference between God and creatures—terms applied to God are used analogically rather than univocally or equivocally.

The Via Negativa (negative way) associated with Pseudo-Dionysius and Maimonides holds that God can only be known by what God is not, since positive attributions are necessarily limited and creaturely.

### Self, Death, and the Afterlife

Philosophical questions about personal identity, the nature of the soul, and the possibility of post-mortem existence form a significant component of the Philosophy of Religion curriculum.

Descartes' argument for the existence of the soul as a non-material substance distinct from the body, and his consequent mind-body dualism, provide a starting point. Students must evaluate the interaction problem (how can immaterial mind affect material body?), alternatives such as physicalism, and various forms of dualism and holism.

The relationship between body and soul, and the implications for understanding death and any possible afterlife, connect philosophical anthropology to soteriological questions.

## Religion and Ethics

### Normative Ethical Theories

A Level ethics requires systematic study of the major normative theories—deontological, teleological, and virtue-based approaches—together with their application to concrete moral issues.

**Deontological Ethics: Natural Moral Law**

Thomas Aquinas' natural law theory, rooted in Aristotelian metaphysics and Christian theology, holds that moral law is grounded in the nature of things and accessible to human reason. The theory identifies primary precepts (preservation of life, procreation, education of offspring, living in society, worship of God) as self-evident principles derived from human nature, with secondary precepts applying these to particular circumstances.

The principle of double effect addresses cases where an action has both good and bad consequences. Proportionalism, developed by contemporary Catholic moral theologians including Richard McCormick and Bernard Häring, offers a revision that places greater weight on consequences while maintaining a deontological framework.

**Teleological Ethics: Situation Ethics**

Joseph Fletcher's situation ethics, presented in his 1966 work of that title, represents a radical Christian consequentialism. Agapé (selfless love) constitutes the sole norm, with all other rules being merely "rules of thumb" that can be overridden when love demands. Fletcher's six propositions distinguish his approach from both legalism and antinomianism.

Critiques of situation ethics include its alleged subjectivity, the difficulty of determining what love requires in complex cases, and questions about whether it genuinely preserves moral absolutes or collapses into relativism.

**Virtue Ethics**

Aristotelian virtue ethics focuses on character rather than actions, asking "What sort of person should I be?" rather than "What should I do?" The theory identifies virtues as character traits that enable human flourishing (*eudaimonia*), with the doctrine of the mean locating virtues between opposed vices.

Contemporary virtue ethics, represented by Alasdair MacIntyre and Rosalind Hursthouse among others, has revived interest in character-based approaches and their application to contemporary moral problems.

**Comparative Analysis**

Students must understand how these theories approach moral decision-making differently, their respective strengths and weaknesses, and how they might be applied to concrete issues. The relationship between religious belief and ethical theory—whether religious ethics requires a divine command foundation or can accommodate autonomous reason—forms a significant theme.

### Issues of Human Life and Death

The application of ethical theory to beginning-of-life and end-of-life questions requires students to engage with contemporary bioethics and its philosophical foundations.

**Embryo Research and Cloning**

Questions about the moral status of the embryo—whether it possesses full personhood, potential personhood, or some intermediate status—underpin debates about embryo research, cloning, and the creation of "designer babies." Different ethical theories yield different conclusions about the permissibility of such procedures.

**Abortion**

The abortion debate engages questions about personhood, bodily autonomy, and the relationship between rights and obligations. Judith Jarvis Thomson's violinist argument attempts to separate the question of personhood from the question of permissible abortion, arguing that even if the foetus is a person, abortion may still be permissible on grounds of bodily autonomy.

**Voluntary Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide**

End-of-life ethics requires consideration of autonomy, the sanctity of life, the distinction between killing and letting die, and the proper goals of medical care. The philosophical literature engages with real-world debates about legalisation, slippery-slope arguments, and the relationship between palliative care and assisted dying.

**Capital Punishment**

The ethics of state execution involves questions about retribution, deterrence, the possibility of error, and the state's authority over life. Religious perspectives, particularly Christian understandings of forgiveness and the value of human life made in God's image, inform traditional opposition, though this is not uniform.

### Issues of Non-Human Life and Death

Animal ethics has grown significantly in philosophical importance, with implications for dietary choices, scientific research, and environmental ethics.

**The Use of Animals as Food**

Factory farming and intensive agriculture raise questions about animal suffering, environmental impact, and human dietary needs. Peter Singer's utilitarian argument for vegetarianism, based on the principle of equal consideration of interests, provides a widely-discussed philosophical framework.

**Animals in Scientific Research**

The use of animals in medical and cosmetic testing engages questions about the moral status of animals, the necessity of such research, and possible alternatives. The 3Rs framework (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement) represents a regulatory approach informed by ethical concerns.

**Blood Sports and Animal Entertainment**

Hunting, fishing, and using animals for entertainment raise distinctive questions about human pleasure, animal suffering, and cultural traditions.

**Animals as a Source of Organs**

Xenotransplantation and the use of animal organs for human transplant surgery present cutting-edge bioethical questions about species boundaries, risk of disease transmission, and the ethical limits of using animals for human benefit.

### Meta-Ethics

Meta-ethics concerns the meaning and status of moral language and judgments—questions about what we are doing when we make moral claims, rather than which moral claims are correct.

**Divine Command Theory**

The divine command theory holds that moral rightness consists in conformity to God's commands, and wrongness in violation of those commands. This raises the Euthyphro dilemma (named after Plato's dialogue): is something good because God commands it, or does God command it because it is good? Each horn presents difficulties for divine command theory.

**Naturalism**

Moral naturalism holds that moral properties are natural properties. Utilitarianism represents a naturalistic theory insofar as it identifies moral rightness with the natural property of causing pleasure or happiness. G.E. Moore's "open question argument" challenges naturalism by suggesting that whatever natural property is identified with goodness, it remains an open question whether that property is good.

**Non-Naturalism: Intuitionism**

G.E. Moore's ethical intuitionism holds that moral values are non-natural properties known through intuition rather than empirical observation or inference. W.D. Ross developed pluralistic deontology based on intuitionist foundations, identifying prima facie duties that can be known directly.

### Free Will and Moral Responsibility

The free will debate connects metaphetaphysics, ethics, and philosophy of religion in examining the conditions under which humans can be held morally responsible for their actions.

**Libertarianism**

Libertarian free will holds that humans have the capacity to make choices that are not determined by prior causes, enabling genuine moral responsibility. This view is often associated with religious belief in divine judgment and reward, though various philosophical arguments for libertarian free will have been developed independently of religious commitments.

**Hard Determinism**

Hard determinism holds that all events, including human choices, are causally determined by prior states of affairs. If determinism is true, traditional understandings of moral responsibility appear threatened, since agents could not have done otherwise than they did.

**Compatibilism**

Compatibilist positions attempt to reconcile determinism with moral responsibility by redefining freedom—not as absence of causation, but as acting according to one's desires and character without external constraint. Harry Frankfurt's hierarchical model of desires provides a sophisticated compatibilist framework.

### Conscience

The nature and authority of conscience raises questions about moral knowledge, moral motivation, and the relationship between reason and emotion in ethics.

Religious and non-religious perspectives offer different accounts of conscience. The traditional Christian view, associated with Aquinas and Butler, sees conscience as the application of rational moral knowledge to particular situations. Freudian and other psychological accounts treat conscience as the internalised voice of parental and social authority.

The value of conscience as a moral guide depends upon these competing accounts. If conscience represents genuine moral insight, it provides reliable guidance; if it merely reflects social conditioning or psychological projection, its authority is questionable.

### Bentham and Kant: A Comparative Study

Jeremy Bentham's utilitarianism and Immanuel Kant's deontology represent two of the most influential approaches to moral philosophy, offering contrasting foundations for ethical decision-making.

Bentham's hedonistic calculus attempts to quantify pleasures and pains to determine the morally right action. Kant's categorical imperative, articulated through various formulations including the universalisability principle and the humanity formulation, grounds morality in rational autonomy rather than consequences.

The consistency of each theory with religious moral decision-making forms a significant topic for evaluation. While Bentham's utilitarianism is formally secular, it can accommodate religious considerations as factors in the felicific calculus. Kant's deontology, though also secular in foundation, has significant affinities with Christian natural law tradition.

## Study of Religion: Textual and Theological Approaches

### The Study of Sacred Texts

A Level specifications require in-depth study of sacred texts, particularly the New Testament for Christian-focused specifications, though options exist for other traditions.

**Textual Study Methodologies**

Historical-critical methods, including source criticism, form criticism, and redaction criticism, provide tools for understanding how texts came to be composed and transmitted. Literary approaches examine narrative structure, genre, and rhetorical strategy. Theological interpretation engages with the text as scripture—that is, as authoritative for religious faith and practice.

Students must understand the relationship between these approaches and their respective contributions to understanding sacred texts. The question of whether historical-critical methods are compatible with faithful reading, or whether they undermine traditional religious interpretations, forms a significant topic.

**New Testament Studies**

For specifications focusing on Christian texts, students engage with:

*The Gospels*: Questions about the historical Jesus, the synoptic problem (the relationship between Matthew, Mark, and Luke), and the distinctive theological perspectives of each evangelist.

*The Letters of Paul*: Paul's theology of justification, his understanding of the relationship between Judaism and Christianity, and his ethical teaching.

*The Person of Jesus*: Christological titles, the development of early Christian understanding of Jesus' significance, and the relationship between the Jesus of history and the Christ of faith.

*The Development of Early Christianity*: The emergence of Christianity from its Jewish matrix, the mission to the Gentiles, and the formation of Christian identity.

### Religious Beliefs, Values, and Teachings

Systematic study of a religious tradition requires understanding its core beliefs, values, and teachings across multiple domains.

**Foundational Beliefs**

Students study beliefs about the nature of ultimate reality (God, the Absolute, the Tao), the nature of the human person (soul, self, consciousness), the origin and destiny of the universe (creation, cycles, eschatology), and the nature of the good life (salvation, enlightenment, liberation).

**Sources of Wisdom and Authority**

The sources recognised as authoritative within a tradition—scriptures, tradition, reason, experience—and the relationship between these sources, form a significant topic. Questions about how traditions interpret their foundational texts, how they handle apparent contradictions or anachronisms, and how they apply ancient teachings to contemporary situations require careful study.

**Practices and Identity**

Religious practices—including ritual, prayer, meditation, pilgrimage, and ethical observance—shape and express religious identity. Students examine how practices embody beliefs, how they vary across cultures and historical periods, and how they function to create and maintain religious communities.

### Developments in Religious Thought

A Level study requires understanding how religious traditions have developed historically and how they engage with contemporary challenges.

**Historical Developments**

Students study significant figures, movements, and controversies that have shaped their chosen tradition. For Christianity, this might include the early councils, the Reformation, the Enlightenment challenge, and modern theological developments. For Buddhism, it might include the early councils, the emergence of Mahayana, and modern adaptations.

**Religion and Society**

The relationship between religion and society raises questions about pluralism, secularism, gender, sexuality, science, and politics. How do religious traditions engage with diverse societies in which they are one voice among many? How do they respond to the challenge of secular worldviews? How do they address questions of equality and inclusion?

**Religion and Dialogue**

Contemporary specifications include study of inter-religious dialogue and the relationship between religious and non-religious worldviews. Students examine different models of religious pluralism (exclusivism, inclusivism, pluralism) and their implications for understanding religious diversity.

## Pedagogical Approaches for A Level Religious Studies

### Developing Philosophical Literacy

The Ofsted subject report for Religious Education (April 2024) found that the overwhelming majority of teachers had not received subject-based professional development in RE—a significant concern given the complexity of the subject matter. At A Level, where philosophical and theological concepts are highly sophisticated, teacher subject knowledge is particularly crucial.

Effective pedagogy for Philosophy of Religion requires:

**Explicit Teaching of Argument Structure**

Students must learn to identify premises and conclusions, to recognise different forms of argument (deductive, inductive, abductive), and to apply techniques of formal and informal logic. Argument mapping and visual representation of reasoning can support this development.

**Philosophical Reading Strategies**

Primary texts—from Anselm's *Proslogion* to contemporary journal articles—require careful, slow reading with attention to logical structure, conceptual distinctions, and argumentative moves. Teachers should model such reading, making their own interpretive processes visible to students.

**The Refutation Framework**

A Level assessment rewards evaluation as well as exposition. Students should learn frameworks for evaluation: identifying assumptions, testing implications, considering alternatives, assessing evidence, and evaluating the coherence of positions.

### Supporting Extended Writing

The transition from GCSE to A Level involves a significant increase in the demands of extended writing. Where GCSE responses might require a few paragraphs, A Level essays require sustained argumentation over 1,000 words or more.

**Essay Structure**

Effective A Level essays in Religious Studies typically follow a clear structure: introduction establishing the question and thesis; exposition of relevant positions and arguments; critical evaluation engaging with strengths and weaknesses; and conclusion drawing threads together and offering a reasoned judgment.

**Integration of Scholarship**

Students must learn to engage with named scholars appropriately—both as sources of content and as models of argumentation. Rather than simply listing scholar opinions, effective essays use scholarly views as points of departure for critical engagement.

**Use of Specialist Language**

All specifications require appropriate use of specialist terminology. However, effective use goes beyond mere vocabulary demonstration to genuine conceptual precision—using terms like "a priori," "contingent," or "deontological" accurately in context.

### Managing the Transition from GCSE

The jump from GCSE to A Level in Religious Studies is considerable. Effective transition programmes might include:

**Pre-Course Reading**

Accessible introductory texts in philosophy of religion and ethics can help students begin developing the conceptual frameworks they will need. However, care must be taken not to embed misconceptions that will require later correction.

**Skill-Building Activities**

Early A Level teaching should explicitly focus on philosophical skills: constructing arguments, identifying fallacies, distinguishing types of claim (empirical, conceptual, normative), and engaging in respectful but rigorous disagreement.

**Diagnostic Assessment**

Early assessment can identify students who may struggle with the conceptual demands of A Level, enabling targeted support before gaps become entrenched.

### Addressing Common Misconceptions

The Ofsted research review and subject report identify persistent misconceptions that pupils hold about religion. At A Level, these include:

**Philosophy Misconceptions**

- Confusing the cosmological argument with the teleological argument
- Treating "proof" in philosophy as equivalent to mathematical or scientific proof
- Assuming that to evaluate an argument is simply to state one's own opinion
- Failing to distinguish between deductive validity and soundness

**Ethics Misconceptions**

- Assuming that all religious ethics is divine command theory
- Conflating descriptive and normative claims about morality
- Treating ethical theories as recipes for decision-making rather than frameworks for justification
- Failing to recognise the diversity within traditions (e.g., assuming all Christians oppose abortion)

**Religious Studies Misconceptions**

- Treating sacred texts as straightforward historical sources rather than complex documents requiring interpretation
- Assuming uniformity across and within religious traditions
- Confusing theology (faith-based reflection) with religious studies (academic analysis)
- Failing to recognise the diversity of belief and practice within any given tradition

### Assessment Preparation

A Level Religious Studies is assessed entirely through examination. Effective preparation includes:

**Understanding Assessment Objectives**

AQA, OCR, and Eduqas all assess similar skills: knowledge and understanding (AO1); analysis and evaluation (AO2). Students must understand what each objective requires and how to demonstrate it in examination conditions.

**Timed Practice**

Regular timed practice under examination conditions helps students develop the pacing and stamina required for A Level examinations. Particular attention should be paid to essay planning under time pressure.

**Synoptic Thinking**

Many A Level questions require students to draw connections between different topics—linking philosophical arguments to ethical issues, or connecting textual study to broader theological questions. Explicit teaching of such connections supports synoptic thinking.

## Contemporary Challenges and Developments

### The Religion and Worldviews Debate

The Commission on Religious Education's 2018 report "Religion and Worldviews: The Way Forward" proposed significant changes to RE, including a reconceptualisation as "Religion and Worldviews" that would include non-religious worldviews on equal terms. While the government has not adopted these recommendations wholesale, they continue to influence curriculum development and professional discourse.

For A Level, the "worldviews" framing has significant implications. Students might engage with:

- Secular humanism as a worldview with ethical commitments, epistemological foundations, and narratives of meaning
- The relationship between science and worldviews, including naturalism as a metaphysical position
- Pluralism not merely as a fact about society but as an epistemological challenge—how should we respond to persistent disagreement about fundamental questions?

### Digital Religion and New Media

The internet has transformed how religion is practised, studied, and debated. A Level students might examine:

- Online religious communities and their relationship to offline religious institutions
- The dissemination of religious knowledge and authority in digital spaces
- Social media as a site of religious debate, evangelism, and conflict
- The impact of digital technology on religious experience and practice

### Religion and Climate Change

Environmental ethics has become increasingly prominent in Religious Studies. Students might engage with:

- Theological and philosophical foundations for environmental responsibility
- The role of religious communities in climate activism
- Questions of intergenerational justice raised by environmental degradation
- The relationship between anthropocentric and ecocentric value systems

## Conclusion

A Level Religious Studies offers students a rigorous introduction to philosophical, ethical, and theological study. The subject develops skills of analysis, evaluation, and extended argumentation that are highly valued in higher education and beyond.

Effective teaching of A Level Religious Studies requires strong subject knowledge across philosophy, ethics, and the study of religion; explicit attention to the development of philosophical literacy and extended writing skills; and careful management of the transition from GCSE. The Ofsted findings about teacher professional development in RE suggest that subject leaders should prioritise ongoing professional learning, particularly for non-specialists or those teaching outside their areas of expertise.

The enduring value of Religious Studies at A Level lies in its engagement with questions that matter: questions about the nature of reality, the basis of morality, the possibility of meaning, and the diversity of human responses to these questions. In an increasingly pluralistic and polarised society, the capacity to engage respectfully but critically with fundamental disagreement is a valuable skill—one that A Level Religious Studies can help to develop.
