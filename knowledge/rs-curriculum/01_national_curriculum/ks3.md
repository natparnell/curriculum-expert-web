# Key Stage 3 Religious Education

## Overview and Statutory Foundation

Key Stage 3 Religious Education (RE) serves as a critical bridge between the foundational understanding developed at Key Stages 1 and 2 and the more specialised study undertaken at GCSE level. The statutory framework for RE at KS3 derives from the same legislative basis that governs the subject throughout compulsory schooling: section 375(3) of the Education Act 1996 and paragraph 5 of Schedule 19 to the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. These provisions require that any locally agreed syllabus must "reflect the fact that the religious traditions in Great Britain are, in the main, Christian while taking account of the teaching and practices of the other principal religions represented in Great Britain."

The RE Council's National Content Standard (2023) provides a non-statutory benchmark for excellence in RE, emphasising that pupils should experience an academically rigorous and personally inspiring education in religion and worldviews. This standard is not a curriculum itself but rather a framework by which different RE curricula, content, and pedagogy can be evaluated and improved. The Standard recognises that without national benchmarks, it can be challenging for syllabus providers, Standing Advisory Councils on RE (SACREs), and Academy Trusts to know whether their RE provision achieves appropriate breadth, depth, and ambition.

At KS3, pupils typically aged 11-14 consolidate and deepen their understanding of the six principal religions while encountering non-religious worldviews in greater depth than at primary level. The curriculum should enable pupils to develop sophisticated analytical skills, engage with complex theological and philosophical questions, and navigate the diversity of religious and non-religious perspectives they encounter in contemporary British society.

## The Six Principal Religions

### Christianity

Christianity remains the principal religious tradition in Great Britain and therefore receives appropriate emphasis within the KS3 RE curriculum. Pupils should build upon their primary-level understanding to engage with the diversity within Christian traditions, recognising that Christianity encompasses Roman Catholic, Anglican, Protestant, Orthodox, and Pentecostal expressions, among others.

At KS3, teaching should move beyond basic narrative to explore the theological foundations of Christian belief. Pupils should understand the significance of the Nicene Creed as a statement of Christian orthodoxy and appreciate how different denominations interpret shared beliefs differently. The doctrine of the Trinity, the nature of salvation, and understandings of the Church require more nuanced treatment than at primary level.

The curriculum should also address the lived experience of British Christianity today. This includes understanding the place of the Church of England as the established church, recognising the historical and contemporary contributions of Black Majority Churches, and appreciating the growing significance of charismatic and Pentecostal expressions of Christianity in urban contexts. Teachers should be aware that many pupils will have limited direct experience of Christian practice and should avoid assumptions about pupils' prior knowledge.

Pedagogically, effective KS3 teaching of Christianity balances substantive knowledge—what Christians believe and do—with disciplinary understanding of how Christian theology develops and how Christians interpret their sacred texts. Pupils should encounter the Bible not merely as a source of stories but as a complex collection of texts requiring interpretation within historical and literary contexts.

### Islam

Islam represents the second largest religious tradition in Britain and demands thorough treatment at KS3. The curriculum should develop pupils' understanding of the Five Pillars as expressions of faith and practice whilst introducing more sophisticated concepts including the nature of revelation, the role of the Qur'an as the literal word of God, and the significance of the Hadith in Islamic jurisprudence.

A crucial dimension of KS3 Islamic studies is addressing diversity within the Muslim community. Pupils should understand the Sunni-Shia distinction and its historical origins, whilst recognising that this binary does not capture the full complexity of Islamic traditions. The curriculum should introduce pupils to different legal schools (madhhabs) and Sufi mystical traditions without presenting any single expression as normative.

Teaching about Islam at KS3 must navigate the reality that Muslim pupils may constitute a significant proportion of the classroom, alongside non-Muslim pupils whose understanding may be shaped by media representations. Effective pedagogy creates space for Muslim pupils to share their experiences where they wish to do so, whilst ensuring that the curriculum does not place them in the position of representing Islam. Teachers should be sensitive to the diversity of practice among Muslim families and avoid generalisations about what "Muslims believe" or "Muslims do."

The curriculum should also address Islam in the British context, including the history of Muslim communities in Britain, contemporary issues facing British Muslims, and the contributions of Muslims to British public life. This contextual grounding helps pupils understand religion as lived experience rather than abstract system.

### Judaism

KS3 study of Judaism builds upon foundational knowledge to explore the complexity of Jewish identity as both religious tradition and ethnic heritage. Pupils should understand that Judaism cannot be reduced simply to religious belief but encompasses cultural, ethnic, and national dimensions.

The curriculum should address the major divisions within Judaism—Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and Liberal—recognising that these represent different approaches to tradition, law, and modernity. Pupils should understand the significance of the Torah as both the written law and the ongoing interpretive tradition represented by the Talmud and subsequent rabbinic literature.

Teaching about Judaism at KS3 requires particular sensitivity given the history of antisemitism and the Holocaust. The curriculum should address the Holocaust where appropriate within the school's broader provision, whilst ensuring that Jewish history and identity are not defined solely through persecution. Pupils should encounter the richness of Jewish life, thought, and culture across history and in contemporary Britain.

The relationship between Judaism and Christianity should be explored, helping pupils understand Christianity's historical roots in Judaism and the subsequent divergence between the traditions. This includes understanding why Jewish people do not recognise Jesus as the Messiah and how both traditions interpret shared scriptural texts differently.

### Hinduism

The study of Hinduism at KS3 addresses one of the most complex religious traditions, requiring teachers to convey both the unity and diversity within Hindu traditions. Pupils should understand that "Hinduism" is itself a contested category, with many practitioners preferring terms such as Sanatana Dharma (eternal law) or referring to specific sampradayas (traditions).

The curriculum should develop pupils' understanding of key concepts including dharma (duty/righteousness), karma (action and its consequences), samsara (the cycle of rebirth), and moksha (liberation). These concepts should be explored not as abstract philosophical ideas but as living principles shaping Hindu practice and identity.

KS3 teaching should address the trimurti of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, whilst recognising that devotional practice (bhakti) typically focuses on particular deities or forms rather than abstract theological categories. Pupils should understand the significance of puja (worship), the role of sacred texts including the Vedas and Puranas, and the importance of pilgrimage within Hindu practice.

The British Hindu community includes significant populations of Indian, East African, and Caribbean heritage. The curriculum should acknowledge this diversity and the contributions of Hindu communities to British society. Many British Hindu families maintain connections to specific regions and temples in India, and pupils should understand Hinduism as a global tradition with local expressions.

### Sikhism

Sikhism, founded in the Punjab region of India in the fifteenth century, represents a distinct religious tradition that synthesises elements from Hindu and Islamic contexts whilst maintaining its own unique identity. At KS3, pupils should develop a nuanced understanding of Sikh beliefs, practices, and history.

The curriculum should address the ten Gurus and the establishment of the Guru Granth Sahib as eternal Guru. Pupils should understand the significance of the Five Ks (kesh, kangha, kara, kachera, kirpan) as outward symbols of Sikh commitment and the importance of the gurdwara as a place of worship and community gathering.

Teaching about Sikhism requires attention to the concept of seva (selfless service), which finds expression in the langar (communal kitchen) where all people regardless of background sit together to share a meal. This practice embodies Sikh principles of equality and community responsibility.

The history of Sikhism includes significant episodes of persecution and martyrdom, which remain important to Sikh identity and memory. The curriculum should address this history appropriately, including the significance of the Khalsa and the tradition of martial courage within Sikhism.

British Sikh communities, particularly in areas such as Southall, Birmingham, and Bradford, have made significant contributions to British public life. The curriculum should situate Sikhism within both its Punjabi heritage and its British context, recognising the diversity of practice and commitment among British Sikhs.

### Buddhism

Buddhist studies at KS3 introduce pupils to a tradition that challenges many Western assumptions about religion. The curriculum should address the Buddha's life and teaching, the Four Noble Truths, and the Noble Eightfold Path, whilst recognising the diversity of Buddhist traditions including Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana.

A distinctive feature of Buddhist teaching is the concept of anatta (non-self) and the emphasis on practice over belief. Pupils should understand that Buddhism does not require belief in a creator God and that enlightenment (nirvana) is achieved through understanding the nature of reality rather than through divine intervention.

The curriculum should introduce pupils to Buddhist meditation practices and their purposes, including mindfulness, which has gained significant attention in contemporary secular contexts. Teachers should distinguish between Buddhist meditation as a religious practice and secular mindfulness programmes derived from Buddhist techniques.

British Buddhist communities include convert Buddhists from European backgrounds and heritage Buddhists from Sri Lankan, Thai, Chinese, and other Asian communities. These different communities often have different practices, temples, and organisational structures. The curriculum should acknowledge this diversity without privileging any particular expression.

## Non-Religious Worldviews

### Humanism

The RE Council and the National Content Standard recognise that non-religious worldviews should be studied alongside religious traditions. Humanism represents the most systematic and organised non-religious worldview encountered at KS3, though teachers should be aware that many people hold non-religious perspectives without identifying specifically as Humanists.

Humanism, as articulated by organisations such as Humanists UK, affirms that human beings can live ethical, meaningful lives without reference to supernatural beliefs. Core Humanist principles include: trust in the scientific method as the best way to understand reality; the belief that this life is the only life we have; the conviction that moral values derive from human experience and reasoning rather than divine command; and commitment to human rights, democracy, and the welfare of all people.

At KS3, pupils should engage with Humanist responses to ultimate questions: How did the universe begin? What happens when we die? How do we know what is right and wrong? Humanist perspectives on these questions are distinct from religious responses and should be presented in their own terms rather than as simply "not believing" in religious answers.

The curriculum should also introduce pupils to the history of Humanist thought, including its roots in classical philosophy, the European Enlightenment, and nineteenth-century freethought movements. Understanding Humanism as a tradition with its own history, texts, and thinkers helps pupils appreciate that non-religious worldviews have intellectual substance and are not merely absences of religious belief.

### Atheism and Agnosticism

KS3 teaching should distinguish between different forms of non-religious position. Atheism, understood simply as lack of belief in God or gods, encompasses a range of positions from the strong assertion that God does not exist to the softer claim that there are insufficient grounds for belief. Agnosticism, properly understood, is not a middle position between belief and unbelief but rather the view that knowledge about God's existence or non-existence is impossible.

Pupils should understand that atheism and agnosticism can be held with varying degrees of certainty and commitment. Some atheists are actively anti-religious, whilst others are simply uninterested in religious questions. The curriculum should avoid presenting atheism as the default or neutral position against which religious beliefs must be justified.

Teaching about non-religious positions requires attention to the reasons people give for their views. Atheist arguments—such as the problem of evil, the hiddenness of God, or critiques of religious experience—should be presented seriously alongside theistic responses. This intellectual engagement helps pupils develop skills in reasoning and argumentation.

### Secular Ethics

The study of non-religious worldviews at KS3 includes engagement with secular ethical frameworks. Utilitarianism, which judges actions by their consequences for overall happiness or wellbeing, represents one major tradition. Deontological ethics, associated with Kant, emphasises duty and the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions regardless of consequences. Virtue ethics focuses on the development of good character rather than rules for action.

These ethical frameworks are not exclusive to non-religious worldviews—religious traditions also engage with questions of consequences, duties, and virtues. However, at KS3, pupils should understand how these frameworks function as self-standing approaches to ethics that do not require theological foundations.

The curriculum should encourage pupils to engage with ethical reasoning through case studies and dilemmas. How would a utilitarian approach organ donation? What would a Kantian say about lying? How does virtue ethics inform professional ethics? Such questions develop pupils' capacity for ethical reasoning regardless of their own worldview commitments.

## Ethical Reasoning at KS3

### Developing Ethical Thinking

The KS3 RE curriculum places significant emphasis on ethical reasoning, building upon foundations laid at primary level whilst preparing pupils for the more systematic ethical study at GCSE. Ethical reasoning in RE involves more than simply stating opinions; it requires the ability to articulate reasons, consider alternative perspectives, and engage with the complexity of real-world moral questions.

Effective pedagogy for ethical reasoning creates structured opportunities for pupils to explore controversial questions in a supportive environment. This includes teaching strategies for respectful disagreement, techniques for evaluating arguments, and frameworks for considering the consequences of different positions. The goal is not to reach consensus but to develop pupils' capacity for reasoned moral discourse.

The RE Council emphasises that RE fosters "critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and cultural awareness, preparing students for life and work in a diverse society." At KS3, this includes engagement with contemporary ethical issues including medical ethics, environmental ethics, questions of equality and human rights, and issues arising from digital technology.

### Religious and Non-Religious Perspectives on Ethics

A key skill at KS3 is the ability to compare and contrast religious and non-religious approaches to ethical questions. This involves understanding how different worldviews ground moral claims—whether in divine command, natural law, human reason, consequential calculation, or virtue development.

The curriculum should address specific ethical topics with attention to both religious and non-religious perspectives. Euthanasia and the right to die, for example, can be examined through Catholic natural law theory, Buddhist teachings on suffering and compassion, Humanist emphasis on autonomy and quality of life, and utilitarian calculations of wellbeing.

Pupils should understand that religious traditions themselves contain diversity of ethical opinion. Within Christianity, for instance, there are debates about the relationship between biblical authority and contemporary moral reasoning. Within Islam, different legal schools may approach ethical questions differently. Recognising this internal diversity helps pupils avoid simplistic characterisations of "what Christians believe" or "the Muslim view."

### Pedagogical Approaches to Ethical Reasoning

Effective teaching of ethical reasoning at KS3 employs a range of pedagogical strategies. Case studies and scenarios provide concrete contexts for ethical reflection. Structured debate and discussion develop skills in articulating and defending positions. Exposure to authentic voices from different traditions through film, text, or (where appropriate) visitors helps pupils engage with lived ethical perspectives.

The concept of "Big Questions" provides a useful framing device for KS3 ethical enquiry. Questions such as "How do we make decisions?" "What makes something right or wrong?" and "How should we respond to suffering?" open space for exploration without predetermined answers. The RE Council notes that it is important "that students bring a certain irreverence to their studies; they are not here to worship what is known, but to question it."

Assessment of ethical reasoning should focus on the quality of pupils' reasoning rather than the conclusions they reach. Can pupils identify relevant considerations? Can they articulate reasons for their views? Can they engage seriously with perspectives different from their own? These process-oriented criteria support open enquiry whilst maintaining academic rigour.

## Diversity Within Traditions

### Understanding Internal Diversity

A crucial development in KS3 RE is the move from essentialist accounts of religious traditions towards recognition of internal diversity. Pupils should understand that "Christianity," "Islam," or "Hinduism" are not monolithic entities but rather umbrella terms encompassing significant variety in belief, practice, and identity.

This recognition of diversity has both substantive and disciplinary dimensions. Substantively, pupils should know that there are different denominations, schools of thought, and cultural expressions within each tradition. Disciplinarily, pupils should understand why this diversity exists—how religious traditions develop, adapt, and splinter over time and across contexts.

Teaching about diversity within traditions requires attention to the reasons for difference. Historical factors, scriptural interpretation, responses to modernity, migration and cultural exchange, and individual religious experience all contribute to the variety within religious traditions. Pupils should develop frameworks for understanding these dynamics rather than simply cataloguing different groups.

### Gender, Sexuality, and Religious Identity

KS3 RE should address questions of gender and sexuality within religious traditions, recognising that these are live issues within and between communities. Pupils should understand that religious traditions contain diverse perspectives on gender roles, women's leadership, and LGBTQ+ inclusion, and that these perspectives are often matters of debate and change.

The curriculum should avoid presenting any single position as the "authentic" view of a tradition. Within Christianity, for instance, there are both complementarian and egalitarian approaches to gender, and diverse perspectives on same-sex relationships. Within Islam, there is ongoing debate about women's religious authority and the inclusion of LGBTQ+ Muslims.

Teaching about these topics requires sensitivity to the diverse backgrounds and identities of pupils. Some pupils may come from religious communities with conservative positions on gender and sexuality; others may identify as LGBTQ+ themselves. Effective pedagogy creates space for respectful engagement with different perspectives whilst maintaining clear expectations about respectful behaviour.

### Religious Identity in Contemporary Britain

The KS3 curriculum should help pupils understand religious identity in contemporary British society, including how people negotiate multiple identities and how religious affiliation intersects with ethnicity, nationality, and culture. Many British people maintain religious identities that are shaped by heritage, family practice, and cultural belonging as well as personal belief.

The concept of "believing without belonging" or "belonging without believing" helps pupils understand that religious identity is complex. Some people identify with religious traditions culturally or ethnically without holding orthodox theological beliefs. Others participate in religious communities without full doctrinal commitment. Still others maintain private spirituality without institutional affiliation.
