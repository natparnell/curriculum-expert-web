# Religious Education: Statutory Framework and Legal Basis

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the statutory framework for Religious Education (RE) in England. Unlike other National Curriculum subjects, RE occupies a unique legal position: it is compulsory for all pupils in maintained schools but sits outside the National Curriculum, with content determined locally rather than centrally.

---

## The Unique Legal Position of RE

### Statutory but Non-National Curriculum

Religious Education is **statutorily required** for all pupils in state-funded schools in England, yet it is **not part of the National Curriculum**. This distinctive status creates a complex legal framework that differs significantly from subjects like mathematics, science, or history.

Key features of RE's legal position:

- **Compulsory for all pupils** unless parents exercise the right of withdrawal
- **Content determined locally** through Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education (SACREs)
- **No central government programme of study** prescribing what must be taught
- **Must reflect the fact that religious traditions in Great Britain are, in the main, Christian**
- **Must take account of the other principal religions represented in Great Britain**

### Historical Context

The current framework for RE developed from the Education Act 1944, which first established statutory RE (then called "Religious Instruction") and the right of parental withdrawal. The Education Reform Act 1988 introduced the National Curriculum but specifically excluded RE, maintaining its separate status. The current legislative basis is found in the Education Act 1996 and the School Standards and Framework Act 1998.

## Primary Legislation

### Education Act 1996

The **Education Act 1996** provides the foundational statutory framework for RE in maintained schools. Key provisions include:

#### Section 375: Agreed Syllabus Requirement

Section 375(3) establishes that RE in maintained schools (other than those with a religious character) must be given in accordance with an **agreed syllabus**:

> "The agreed syllabus shall reflect the fact that the religious traditions in Great Britain are in the main Christian whilst taking account of the teaching and practices of the other principal religions represented in Great Britain."

This dual requirement—Christianity as the main tradition plus recognition of other principal religions—has shaped RE provision for decades.

#### Section 376: Right of Withdrawal

Section 376 establishes the **right of parents to withdraw their children** from RE:

- Parents may request that their child be wholly or partly excused from RE
- The withdrawal may be from all RE or specific elements
- Schools must comply with such requests unless the child is receiving RE elsewhere
- Pupils aged 18 or in the sixth form may withdraw themselves

The right of withdrawal was originally conceived as protection for religious minorities at a time when RE was primarily Christian confessional instruction. It applies to **all schools**, including those with and without religious designation.

### School Standards and Framework Act 1998

The **School Standards and Framework Act 1998** significantly expanded RE legislation, particularly regarding collective worship and academy provisions.

#### Schedule 19: RE in Special Schools and Academies

Schedule 19 extends RE requirements to:

- **Special schools**: RE must be provided in accordance with an agreed syllabus
- **Academies**: The funding agreement must specify RE requirements

#### Section 70: Collective Worship

Section 70 establishes the requirement for **daily collective worship**:

> "Each pupil in attendance at a community, foundation or voluntary school shall on each school day take part in an act of collective worship."

Key provisions:

- Collective worship must be **wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian character**
- The requirement applies to all maintained schools
- Parents may withdraw their children from collective worship
- Sixth form students may withdraw themselves
- Schools can apply for exemption from the broadly Christian requirement

### Children and Social Work Act 2017

The **Children and Social Work Act 2017** introduced new requirements for Relationships and Sex Education (RSE), which intersects with RE in important ways. While RSE became mandatory from September 2020, parents do **not** have a right of withdrawal from the relationships education component (only from sex education at primary level).

---

## Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education (SACRE)

### Establishment and Purpose

Every **local authority** (formerly local education authority) is required by law to establish a **Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education (SACRE)**. SACREs are permanent bodies with statutory functions related to RE and collective worship.

### Statutory Functions

SACREs have three primary statutory functions:

1. **Advise the local authority** on matters concerning RE to be given in accordance with an agreed syllabus
2. **Support the effective provision of collective worship**
3. **Consider complaints** about the provision of RE or collective worship

Additionally, SACREs may:
- Publish advice on methods of teaching RE and conducting collective worship
- Provide resources and training for teachers
- Monitor RE provision within the local authority area
- Discuss any matter related to its functions as it sees fit

### SACRE Structure: The Four Committees

SACREs are composed of four committees (sometimes called groups), each representing different stakeholder interests:

#### Committee A: Christian Denominations and Other Religions

- Represents **Christian denominations** (other than the Church of England)
- Represents **other religions and religious denominations** as appropriate to the local area
- Composition should reflect the **principal religious traditions** in the authority's area
- Members are appointed by the local authority based on nominations from religious communities

#### Committee B: The Church of England

- Represents the **Church of England** specifically
- Members are nominated by the **diocese** (usually the Diocesan Board of Education)
- This separate representation reflects the established status of the Church of England
- In Wales, this committee represents the Church in Wales instead

#### Committee C: Teacher Associations

- Represents **associations representing teachers**
- Composition should reflect teaching interests in the area
- Usually includes representatives from teaching unions and professional associations
- Ensures practitioner voice in RE decision-making

#### Committee D: The Local Authority

- Represents the **local authority** itself
- Usually includes elected councillors and local authority officers
- Provides the link between SACRE work and local authority policy

### Agreed Syllabus Conferences (ASCs)

When a local authority needs to produce or review its **agreed syllabus**, it must convene an **Agreed Syllabus Conference (ASC)**. The ASC:

- Has the same four-committee structure as the SACRE
- Must agree the syllabus by consensus (all four committees must approve)
- Produces a syllabus for recommendation to the local authority
- The local authority may then adopt the syllabus for use in its schools

Agreed syllabuses must be **reviewed at least every five years**, requiring a new ASC to be convened.

---

## Locally Agreed Syllabuses

### What is an Agreed Syllabus?

An **agreed syllabus** is a statutory syllabus for RE that has been:

1. Produced by an Agreed Syllabus Conference
2. Recommended for adoption by the local authority
3. Formally adopted by the local authority
4. Made available to all schools in the area

Agreed syllabuses are **not** centrally prescribed by the Department for Education. Each local authority (or groups of authorities working together) determines the content appropriate for their schools.

### Statutory Requirements for Agreed Syllabuses

All agreed syllabuses must meet certain statutory requirements derived from the Education Act 1996:

#### The Christian Principal Requirement

Agreed syllabuses **must reflect** that religious traditions in Great Britain are, in the main, Christian. This does not mean:
- That Christianity must dominate the curriculum
- That Christianity must be taught confessionally
- That other religions are less important

It does mean that:
- Christianity should be studied in depth
- Christianity should be the reference point for understanding religion in Britain
- The significance of Christianity in British culture and history should be recognised

#### The Other Principal Religions Requirement

Agreed syllabuses **must take account of** the teaching and practices of the other principal religions represented in Great Britain. The six principal religions typically recognised are:

1. **Christianity**
2. **Islam**
3. **Judaism**
4. **Hinduism**
5. **Sikhism**
6. **Buddhism**

Syllabuses should provide meaningful engagement with these traditions, though the depth and breadth will vary by key stage.

#### Non-Confessional Requirement

Agreed syllabuses **must not** provide RE by means of any **catechism or formulary** which is distinctive of any particular religious denomination. This means:

- RE must be **educational**, not confessional or evangelistic
- The aim is to learn **about** religion, not to be instructed **in** a particular faith
- Worship or prayer should not form part of RE lessons
- Personal commitment should not be expected or encouraged

### Content of Agreed Syllabuses

While content varies between local authorities, agreed syllabuses typically include:

- **Aims and purposes** of RE
- **Attainment targets** or learning outcomes by key stage
- **Programmes of study** indicating content to be covered
- **Assessment guidance** for teachers
- **Approaches to teaching and learning**
- **Requirements for different key stages**

### Joint Syllabuses

Some local authorities work together to produce **joint agreed syllabuses**. This:

- Reduces duplication of effort
- Enables shared resources and training
- Creates consistency across regional areas
- Is particularly common among smaller local authorities

---

## RE in Different Types of Schools

### Community Schools

**Community schools** (maintained schools without a religious character):

- Must teach RE in accordance with the **locally agreed syllabus**
- Must provide **daily collective worship** that is broadly Christian
- Must comply with SACRE advice
- Cannot provide denominational RE

### Foundation and Voluntary Controlled Schools

**Foundation schools** and **voluntary controlled schools**:

- Are similar to community schools in RE requirements
- Must follow the **locally agreed syllabus** unless parents request denominational RE
- If parents request RE according to the school's faith, the school must provide it
- Must provide broadly Christian collective worship

### Voluntary Aided Schools

**Voluntary aided schools** with a religious character:

- May provide RE according to the **tenets of their faith** (e.g., Catholic, Jewish)
- Are not required to follow the locally agreed syllabus
- Must still recognise other principal religions
- Must provide collective worship in accordance with their faith
- Parents may still request RE according to the agreed syllabus

### Academies and Free Schools

**Academies** and **free schools** operate under **funding agreements** rather than local authority control, but RE requirements still apply.

#### Academies Without Religious Designation

The funding agreement requires academies to:

- Provide RE to all pupils in accordance with the requirements for **agreed syllabuses**
- Follow the same statutory framework as community schools (Education Act 1996, section 375(3))
- Reflect that religious traditions are mainly Christian while taking account of other principal religions
- Not use catechism or formulary distinctive of any denomination

Academies may:
- Adopt the locally agreed syllabus (most common)
- Adopt a different area's agreed syllabus
- Develop their own syllabus meeting statutory requirements

#### Academies With Religious Designation

Academies with a religious designation:

- Must provide RE in accordance with the **tenets of the designated faith**
- May also provide RE according to an agreed syllabus
- May teach about other faiths
- Must provide collective worship according to their faith

#### Former Faith School Conversions

When voluntary-controlled or foundation faith schools convert to academies:

- They generally follow the **agreed syllabus requirements**
- Unless parents request RE according to the school's faith
- In which case, they must provide faith-based RE for those children

### Independent Schools

**Independent schools** are not required to provide RE, though many do. The Independent Schools Standards require:

- Provision for pupils' **spiritual, moral, social and cultural development**
- Many independent schools choose to provide RE as part of meeting these requirements

---

## Collective Worship

### Statutory Requirement

The **School Standards and Framework Act 1998** requires that all pupils in maintained schools take part in a **daily act of collective worship**, unless withdrawn by parents.

### "Broadly Christian" Character

Collective worship in community schools and academies without religious designation must be **wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian character**:

- Worship should be based on **Christian traditions**
- The majority of collective worship should reflect Christian values and beliefs
- Schools may reflect the religious backgrounds of their community alongside the Christian element
- The requirement is for **character**, not necessarily content—worship can be inclusive

### Requirements by School Type

| School Type | Collective Worship Requirement |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Community schools | Broadly Christian |
| Foundation schools | Broadly Christian |
| Voluntary controlled schools | Broadly Christian |
| Voluntary aided schools | According to school's faith |
| Academies without designation | Broadly Christian |
| Academies with designation | According to academy's faith |

### Exemptions from "Broadly Christian"

Schools without a religious designation may apply to the Secretary of State for **exemption** from the requirement for broadly Christian worship. Applications must include:

- **Reasons** for the application (e.g., consideration of pupils' family backgrounds)
- Evidence of **consultation** with governors and parents
- **Proposals** for the nature of future collective worship

Exemptions may be granted for the whole school or specific groups of pupils.

### The Difference Between RE and Collective Worship

It is essential to distinguish between these two statutory requirements:

| Aspect | Religious Education | Collective Worship |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Nature** | Educational, academic | Spiritual, reflective |
| **Purpose** | Learn about religions | Gather for worship |
| **Right of withdrawal** | Parents (all ages) | Parents (all ages), sixth form self-withdrawal |
| **Content** | Multi-faith, objective | Can be faith-specific |
| **Location** | Classroom | Whole school or groups |
| **Assessment** | May be assessed | Never assessed |

Schools must ensure RE lessons are not used for worship, and collective worship is not used for RE teaching.

---

## Right of Withdrawal

### Parental Right

Parents have the **absolute right** to withdraw their children from:

- All or part of **RE lessons**
- All or part of **collective worship**
- **Both** RE and collective worship

This right:
- Applies to **all types of schools**, including faith schools
- Cannot be refused by the school
- Does not require parents to give reasons
- Applies to pupils of all ages

### Sixth Form Self-Withdrawal

Pupils aged **18 or over** (sixth form students) may:
- Withdraw **themselves** from collective worship
- Withdraw themselves from RE (though this is rare at this age)

Parents of sixth form students cannot withdraw them—the right transfers to the student.

### Practical Arrangements

When parents exercise the right of withdrawal:

- Schools should discuss with parents the **nature and extent** of withdrawal
- Withdrawal can be from specific elements (e.g., a particular religion) or all RE
- Alternative **supervised provision** must be arranged
- Withdrawn time should **not** be used for other curriculum subjects
- Reasonable requests for withdrawal should be accommodated

### Changing Attitudes to Withdrawal

The original purpose of the right of withdrawal was to protect religious minorities from Christian confessional RE. As RE has become more educational and multi-faith, withdrawal has become less common. However, some parents still withdraw children:

- On **religious grounds** (objecting to multi-faith RE)
- On **secular grounds** (objecting to any religion in schools)
- From **specific content** (e.g., sex education within RE)

---

## The Commission on RE (CoRE) 2018

### Background and Establishment

The **Commission on Religious Education** was established in 2016 to review the current state of RE and make recommendations for its future. The Commission was chaired by **John Clarke** and included members from across the RE community, including academics, teachers, and representatives of religious and non-religious worldviews.

### The Final Report: "Religion and Worldviews"

The Commission published its final report in **September 2018**, titled **"Religion and Worldviews: The Way Forward"**. The report made **11 recommendations** for reforming RE.

### Key Recommendations

#### 1. New Name: "Religion and Worldviews"

The Commission recommended renaming the subject to **"Religion and Worldviews"** to reflect:
- The inclusion of non-religious worldviews (humanism, secularism)
- The academic study of how people view the world
- A broader, more inclusive approach

#### 2. National Entitlement

The Commission proposed a **National Entitlement** specifying what all pupils should study:
- Not a national curriculum (content still locally determined)
- A framework ensuring consistency and progression
- Clear expectations for each key stage

#### 3. Revised Purpose

The Commission proposed a new purpose statement:
> "To enable pupils to know about and understand the beliefs and practices of religions and worldviews, and to explore and express their own responses to big questions about the meaning and purpose of life."

#### 4. Professional Development

The Commission recommended significant investment in **CPD for RE teachers**, recognising the subject's complexity and the need for specialist knowledge.

#### 5. Local Networks

The Commission proposed establishing **Local Advisory Networks for Religion and Worldviews** to replace or supplement SACRE functions.

### Implementation Status

As of 2026:
- The **CoRE recommendations have not been implemented** by government
- RE remains in its current statutory framework
- The term "Religion and Worldviews" is used by some practitioners but is not official
- SACREs continue to operate as before
- The Commission's work has influenced debate but not legislation

### Significance of CoRE

Despite non-implementation, the Commission's report is significant because:
- It represents **consensus across the RE community** about needed reforms
- It provides a **roadmap** for schools wanting to develop their RE
- It has influenced **agreed syllabus reviews** in many local authorities
- It articulated the case for including **non-religious worldviews**
- It highlighted the need for **better teacher training** in RE

---

## Ofsted and RE

### Inspection Framework

RE is inspected by **Ofsted** as part of the school curriculum. Key aspects of inspection include:

- **Curriculum intent**: What is the school trying to achieve through RE?
- **Implementation**: How is RE taught? Is there sufficient curriculum time?
- **Impact**: What do pupils know and remember? Can they apply their learning?

### Subject Deep Dives

Ofsted may conduct **deep dives** into RE during inspection, particularly when:
- RE is identified as a strength or area for development
- The school has a religious designation
- RE is mentioned in the school's self-evaluation

Inspectors will:
- Review curriculum planning and sequencing
- Observe RE lessons
- Speak to pupils about their RE learning
- Scrutinise pupils' work
- Discuss RE leadership with subject leaders

### Research Review Series

Ofsted published its **Research Review Series: Religious Education** in 2021. Key findings included:

- The importance of **disciplinary knowledge** in RE (how we study religion)
- The need for **secure substantive knowledge** (what we know about religions)
- The significance of **personal knowledge** (pupils reflecting on their own views)
- The importance of **vocabulary** and conceptual understanding
- The need for **regular, high-quality RE** throughout a pupil's education

### Common Inspection Findings

Ofsted frequently identifies issues in RE, including:

- **Insufficient curriculum time** (often the first subject to lose time)
- **Non-specialist teaching** (particularly in primary schools)
- **Weak curriculum planning** (topics not sequenced effectively)
- **Superficial engagement** with religions (surface-level facts rather than deep understanding)
- **Assessment issues** (unclear what is being assessed and why)

---

## Curriculum Time Requirements

### Statutory Minimums

There is **no statutory minimum** number of hours for RE specified in law. However, various bodies have issued guidance:

#### National Association of Teachers of RE (NATRE) Recommendations

NATRE recommends the following minimum time allocations:

- **Key Stage 1**: 36 hours per year (approximately 1 hour per week)
- **Key Stage 2**: 45 hours per year (approximately 1.25 hours per week)
- **Key Stage 3**: 45 hours per year (approximately 1 hour per week)
- **Key Stage 4**: 40 hours per year (for pupils not taking GCSE RS)

#### Ofsted Expectations

Ofsted does not specify time requirements but expects schools to provide:
- **Sufficient time** for pupils to achieve the curriculum aims
- **Regular** RE provision (not ad hoc or occasional)
- **Progression** over time (not the same topics repeated)

### The Primary RE Problem

Research by the **National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER)** and others has shown:

- Many primary schools provide **less than the recommended time** for RE
- RE is often the first subject to lose time to English and mathematics
- Many primary teachers lack confidence in teaching RE
- RE is often taught by non-specialists or class teachers with limited RE training

This has led to concerns about the quality and consistency of RE provision in primary schools.

---

## Non-Religious Worldviews

### The Inclusion Debate

A significant development in RE has been the debate about including **non-religious worldviews** such as:

- **Humanism** (atheist, agnostic, secular humanist)
- **Secularism** (separation of religion and state)
- **Existentialism** and other philosophical perspectives

### Legal Position

The law does not explicitly require non-religious worldviews to be included in RE. The statutory requirement refers to "other principal religions represented in Great Britain."

However:
- The **Commission on RE (2018)** argued strongly for inclusion
- Some **agreed syllabuses** include non-religious worldviews
- The **High Court (2015)** ruled that RE syllabuses that exclude non-religious worldviews may be unlawful

### Current Practice

Many agreed syllabuses now include non-religious worldviews, particularly at Key Stage 3 and above. This reflects:
- The changing religious landscape of Britain (increasing numbers of non-religious people)
- The educational value of studying diverse perspectives
- The need for RE to remain relevant to all pupils

---

## Challenges and Issues in RE

### The "Cinderella Subject"

RE has often been described as the **"Cinderella subject"**—overlooked and under-resourced. Challenges include:

#### Time Pressures
- Pressure to prioritise English and mathematics
- RE being marginalised in the curriculum
- Inconsistent time allocation across schools

#### Teacher Supply
- Shortage of RE specialists, particularly in primary
- Many RE teachers are non-specialists
- Limited initial teacher training in RE

#### Status and Perception
- RE not part of the National Curriculum
- EBacc exclusion of RE at GCSE
- Public misunderstanding of RE's educational purpose

#### Resources
- Limited funding for RE materials
- Fewer published resources than core subjects
- Schools relying on free or low-cost materials

### The GCSE RS Issue

At Key Stage 4, schools must provide RE for all pupils not taking GCSE RS. However:
- Many schools only provide RE to pupils taking the GCSE
- Non-exam RE often receives minimal time and attention
- There is no national qualification for non-exam RE

This creates a **two-tier system** where some pupils receive high-quality RE (GCSE) while others receive minimal provision.

### Assessment Challenges

Assessing RE presents particular challenges:
- How to assess understanding of beliefs without assessing belief itself
- How to evaluate pupils' personal responses fairly
- How to ensure assessment is valid and reliable
- How to report progress to parents

Many agreed syllabuses provide progression frameworks, but there is no national assessment system for RE.

---

## Best Practice in RE

Despite challenges, many schools provide excellent RE. Characteristics of effective RE include:

### Strong Curriculum Design

- **Clear progression** from EYFS through to Key Stage 5
- **Balanced coverage** of religions and worldviews
- **Appropriate time allocation** for each key stage
- **Regular review** and updating of curriculum content

### Skilled Teaching

- **Subject-specialist teachers** where possible
- **High-quality CPD** for all RE teachers
- **Secure subject knowledge** about religions and pedagogical approaches
- **Engaging teaching strategies** that promote deep learning

### Assessment for Learning

- **Regular assessment** of pupils' knowledge and understanding
- **Feedback** that helps pupils improve
- **Tracking** of progress over time
- **Use of assessment** to inform teaching

### Inclusive Practice

- **Respectful exploration** of all religions and worldviews
- **Safe spaces** for pupils to discuss sensitive issues
- **Recognition** of pupils' own beliefs and backgrounds
- **Avoidance** of indoctrination or evangelism

### Community Engagement

- **Visits** to places of worship
- **Visitors** from faith and belief communities
- **Partnerships** with local SACRE and faith organisations
- **Recognition** of local religious diversity
