# Key Stage 2 Religious Education: Statutory Requirements

## Introduction

Religious Education (RE) at Key Stage 2 builds upon the foundations laid at Key Stage 1, developing pupils' knowledge and understanding of religious and non-religious worldviews in greater depth and breadth. During Years 3, 4, 5, and 6, pupils encounter a wider range of religious traditions, explore more complex concepts, and develop increasingly sophisticated skills of analysis, interpretation, and evaluation.

The statutory framework for RE at Key Stage 2 follows the same structure as at Key Stage 1: RE is a compulsory subject for all pupils in maintained schools, with content determined by the Locally Agreed Syllabus produced by the local authority's Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education (SACRE). National guidance from the Religious Education Council of England and Wales (REC) provides a framework that informs these local syllabuses.

Key Stage 2 is a critical period for developing religious literacy—the knowledge, understanding, and skills needed to engage with religious and ethical questions in an informed way. The curriculum aims to develop pupils' understanding of diverse beliefs and practices while also fostering their ability to reflect on their own perspectives and values.

This document examines the statutory framework and expectations for Key Stage 2 RE, drawing upon the National Curriculum statutory guidance, the REC's curriculum framework, and insights from RE education research and practice.

## The Statutory Framework

### Legal Requirements

The legal requirements for RE at Key Stage 2 are the same as at other key stages:

- RE is a statutory subject for all registered pupils in maintained schools
- Schools must teach RE to all pupils unless withdrawn by their parents
- Community schools must follow their Locally Agreed Syllabus
- Faith schools may follow their faith syllabus or the Locally Agreed Syllabus
- RE should be "in the main Christian, whilst taking account of the teaching and practices of the other principal religions represented in Great Britain"

### Time Allocation

There is no statutory requirement for the amount of time to be spent on RE, but good practice suggests:

- Approximately 45-60 hours of RE per year (equivalent to about one hour per week)
- Sustained units of work rather than brief, fragmented sessions
- Regular timetabled lessons that signal the importance of the subject

### Locally Agreed Syllabuses

As at Key Stage 1, the specific content is determined by the Locally Agreed Syllabus. These syllabuses:

- Are produced by SACREs and reviewed every five years
- Reflect the religious traditions represented in the local area
- Must be consistent with national guidance
- Provide the detailed content that schools must teach

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Balanced RE

Effective Key Stage 2 RE maintains balance between:

- **Learning from religion**: Reflecting on religious beliefs and practices in relation to one's own experience and values

Both dimensions are essential for a full RE curriculum.

### Concept-Based RE

Many syllabuses and resources use a concept-based approach:

- Teaching through key concepts (belief, authority, worship, ritual, symbolism, etc.)
- Exploring how different religions understand and express these concepts
- Developing transferable understanding

### Textual Study

At Key Stage 2, pupils engage more directly with religious texts:

- Reading and interpreting stories from scripture

- Recognising different literary genres within religious texts

### Discussion and Dialogue

RE at Key Stage 2 involves significant discussion:

- Discussing religious and ethical questions
- Respecting different viewpoints
- Developing skills of reasoned argument
- Learning from each other's perspectives

## Assessment at Key Stage 2

### Formative Assessment

Ongoing assessment focuses on:

- **Knowledge**: Do pupils know the key facts about religious traditions?
- **Understanding**: Can pupils explain beliefs, practices, and concepts?
- **Skills**: Can pupils investigate, interpret, and analyse?
- **Reflection**: Can pupils reflect on their own learning and experience?

### End of Key Stage Expectations

## Transition to Key Stage 3

### Preparing for Secondary RE

Key Stage 2 RE prepares pupils for the more demanding curriculum at Key Stage 3 by:

- **Building knowledge**: Providing the foundational knowledge needed for deeper study
- **Developing skills**: Establishing skills of analysis, interpretation, and evaluation
- **Fostering attitudes**: Developing open, enquiring, respectful attitudes
- **Engaging with complexity**: Introducing pupils to the complexity of religious and ethical questions

### Continuity

Effective transition requires:

- **Information sharing**: Primary schools sharing information about what has been taught
- **Building on foundations**: Secondary schools building on prior learning rather than starting from scratch
- **Maintaining interest**: Ensuring that pupils' interest in RE is maintained through engaging content

## Challenges and Considerations

### Complexity and Sensitivity

Key Stage 2 RE deals with complex and sensitive topics:

- **Different beliefs about God**: Managing the fact that pupils (and teachers) have different beliefs
- **Controversial issues**: Addressing topics that may be controversial or upsetting
- **Diverse classrooms**: Respecting the diversity of pupils' backgrounds and beliefs

### Teacher Knowledge

RE at Key Stage 2 demands considerable subject knowledge:

- **Multiple traditions**: Teachers need knowledge of several religious traditions
- **Depth and accuracy**: Ensuring that teaching is theologically and culturally accurate
- **Ongoing learning**: Keeping up to date with developments in religious communities

### Resources

Good quality resources are essential:

- **Authentic materials**: Using materials that accurately represent religious traditions
- **Diverse perspectives**: Including diverse voices within religious traditions
- **Up-to-date resources**: Ensuring resources reflect contemporary religious practice

## Conclusion

Key Stage 2 RE is a crucial period in pupils' religious education. During these years, pupils extend their knowledge of religious and non-religious worldviews, develop increasingly sophisticated understanding and skills, and begin to engage more deeply with the big questions of meaning, purpose, and value.

The statutory framework ensures that all pupils have the opportunity to learn about Christianity and other principal religions, as well as non-religious worldviews. The Locally Agreed Syllabus provides the detailed content, while national guidance ensures coherence and quality.

Effective Key Stage 2 RE is characterised by accurate knowledge, respectful exploration of diversity, development of analytical and reflective skills, and engagement with questions that matter to pupils. Teachers who provide rich learning experiences, encourage questioning and discussion, and foster respectful attitudes prepare pupils well for the more demanding RE of Key Stage 3 and for life as informed, thoughtful citizens in a diverse society.

As pupils complete Key Stage 2, they should have a solid foundation of religious literacy—knowledge, understanding, and skills—that enables them to engage with religious and ethical questions throughout their lives, whether they continue formal RE study or not.
