# Key Stage 4 Religious Studies

This document covers the statutory framework, GCSE specifications, and pedagogical considerations for teaching Religious Studies at Key Stage 4 (ages 14–16) in England.

---

## Overview: The Dual Nature of RE at KS4

Key Stage 4 presents a distinctive context for religious education in English schools. Unlike other key stages, KS4 operates within a dual framework:

1. **Statutory Religious Education** — the continuing legal entitlement for all pupils, unless withdrawn by parents
2. **GCSE Religious Studies** — an optional academic qualification that many, but not all, pupils pursue

This duality creates both opportunities and challenges for curriculum design, staffing, and the legal compliance of schools. Understanding the relationship between these two components is essential for trust-wide consistency and Ofsted preparedness.

## GCSE Religious Studies Specifications

### The National Subject Content

The Department for Education (DfE, 2016) establishes the national subject content that all awarding organisations must include in their GCSE Religious Studies specifications. This ensures comparability across exam boards whilst allowing for legitimate variation in approach.

#### Required Content Areas

All GCSE specifications must include study of:

**Component 1: The Study of Religions (50% of assessment)**

Pupils must study the beliefs, teachings, and practices of **two religions** selected from:
- Buddhism
- Christianity (including Catholic Christianity as a separate option)
- Hinduism
- Islam
- Judaism
- Sikhism

For each selected religion, specifications must cover:
- **Beliefs and teachings**: the nature of God, creation, the afterlife, sources of wisdom and authority
- **Practices**: worship, pilgrimage, festivals, domestic and family life, the role of the religious community

Common and divergent views within each religion must be addressed. For example, within Islam, students should understand the basis for Sunni and Shi'a differences.

**Component 2: Thematic Studies (50% of assessment)**

Pupils must study **four themes** from a prescribed list:

| Theme | Content Coverage |
|-------|-----------------|
| Theme A | Relationships and families |
| Theme B | Religion and life |
| Theme C | The existence of God and revelation |
| Theme D | Religion, peace and conflict |
| Theme E | Religion, crime and punishment |
| Theme F | Religion, human rights and social justice |

Within each theme, specifications must include:
- Religious teachings and beliefs about the theme
- The influence of religious beliefs on individuals, communities, and societies
- Non-religious perspectives (including atheist and humanist views)
- Ethical theories and their application

### Awarding Organisation Specifications

Three awarding organisations currently offer GCSE Religious Studies in England:

#### AQA (Specification 8062)

AQA's specification is the most widely entered, offering:
- **Component 1**: Study of two religions from Buddhism, Christianity, Catholic Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Sikhism
- **Component 2**: Four religious, philosophical, and ethical studies themes

Assessment:
- Two written examinations, each 1 hour 45 minutes
- Each component worth 50% of the final GCSE grade
- Available at both Higher and Foundation tiers (grades 9–4 Higher; 5–1 Foundation)

AQA provides extensive supporting materials including prescribed texts and exemplar responses.

#### Edexcel GCSE (9-1) Religious Studies A and B

Edexcel offers two distinct pathways:

**Specification A**: Area of Study 1 (study of religion) + Area of Study 2 (study of religion and ethics, or religion, philosophy, and social justice)

**Specification B**: Full course covering two religions plus philosophy and ethics, with all content externally assessed

Both specifications include the required DfE content whilst offering different assessment structures and supporting resources.

#### OCR GCSE (9-1) Religious Studies

OCR provides specifications J625 (full course) and J125 (short course), with content structured around:
- Beliefs and teachings
- Practices
- Religious, philosophical, and ethical studies

OCR's approach emphasises philosophical reasoning alongside religious content.

## Core RE: The Statutory Entitlement

### Legal Requirements

Despite the prominence of GCSE Religious Studies, schools must remember that **statutory RE continues for all pupils at Key Stage 4**. The legal framework established by the Education Act 1996 and subsequent regulations remains in force:

- **RE is compulsory** for all registered pupils in maintained schools, unless withdrawn by parents
- **RE is an entitlement for all pupils** on the roll of every school
- This entitlement persists **regardless of whether pupils are studying GCSE RS**

As Ofsted (2024) notes: "RE is an entitlement for all pupils on the roll of every school, unless they have been withdrawn by their parents from RE."

### The "Core RE" Distinction

Schools commonly distinguish between:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **GCSE RS** | The optional academic qualification, following an exam board specification |
| **Core RE** | The statutory provision for pupils not taking GCSE RS, meeting legal requirements |

Core RE must:
- Follow the locally agreed syllabus (maintained schools) or the school's own curriculum (academies)
- Provide meaningful educational content
- Respect the legal requirement for "balanced and broadly-based" education

### Non-GCSE Pupils: A Vulnerable Group

Ofsted's subject report (2024) found that pupils who do not take GCSE RS often receive "significantly poorer" RE than their peers:

> "In too many primary and secondary schools, the religious education that pupils receive is of a poor quality and not fit for purpose."

Key concerns include:
- Core RE being taught by non-specialists with limited subject knowledge
- Curriculum content reduced to generic "citizenship" or "PSHE" material
- Insufficient time allocation (sometimes as little as 30 minutes per fortnight)
- Lack of assessment or progression tracking

### Core RE Curriculum Design

Effective Core RE programmes should:

1. **Maintain disciplinary rigour**: Continue developing pupils' ability to analyse religious and non-religious worldviews using appropriate concepts and methods

2. **Address contemporary relevance**: Engage with issues that matter to young people (climate change, medical ethics, social justice) through religious and philosophical lenses

3. **Build on prior learning**: Progress from KS3 content, avoiding unnecessary repetition whilst ensuring secure foundations

4. **Respect pupils as thinkers**: Avoid content that patronises older pupils; instead, offer intellectually challenging material appropriate to their cognitive development

5. **Support personal development**: Contribute to pupils' spiritual, moral, social, and cultural development without evangelism or indoctrination

## The Relationship Between GCSE and Statutory RE

### Key Distinctions

| Aspect | GCSE Religious Studies | Statutory RE (Core) |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Legal basis** | Optional qualification | Compulsory subject |
| **Specification** | Awarding organisation syllabus | Locally agreed syllabus or trust curriculum |
| **Assessment** | External examination | Internal (or none) |
| **Qualification** | GCSE grade awarded | No qualification awarded |
| **Time allocation** | Typically 2–3 hours per week | Variable; often 30 min – 1 hour per week |
| **Pupil groups** | Self-selecting (often higher-attaining) | All pupils not taking GCSE RS |

### Ofsted's Findings on the Relationship

Ofsted (2024) identified serious issues in how schools manage this relationship:

**Common Problems:**
- Schools conflating GCSE RS with statutory RE, believing that offering the GCSE satisfies their legal obligations
- GCSE being taught as a "surrogate" for Core RE, neglecting pupils who do not take the qualification
- Curriculum narrowing, with thematic GCSE content inadequately exploring the depth of religious traditions
- Inappropriate use of GCSE-style assessment for Core RE, creating unnecessary pressure without qualification benefit

**Recommended Practice:**
- Clear curriculum documentation distinguishing GCSE RS from Core RE provision
- Explicit rationales for why some pupils pursue GCSE whilst others do not
- Equally ambitious curricula for both routes, differentiated by outcome rather than aspiration
- Specialist teaching for both GCSE and Core RE where possible

### Whole-School Timetabling Considerations

Trusts should consider:

1. **Parallel provision**: Can Core RE and GCSE RS run simultaneously, or do they require separate staffing?

2. **Option blocking**: Does the GCSE RS option block create problematic groupings (e.g., all higher-attaining pupils in one group)?

3. **Staffing implications**: Who teaches Core RE? Is there sufficient subject expertise?

4. **Withdrawal management**: How does the school handle parental withdrawal requests, and what alternative provision is offered?

## The National Entitlement Debate

### Current Context

The current arrangements for RE at KS4 have been subject to significant critique:

- **The RE Commission Report (2018)** recommended replacing the current system with a "National Entitlement" for all pupils up to the end of Year 11
- **NATRE and the Religious Education Council** continue to advocate for statutory reform
- **Humanists UK** campaigns for inclusive, impartial RE as a national entitlement for all pupils

### Proposed National Entitlement Model

Under proposed reforms, all pupils would be entitled to:
- Systematic study of religions and non-religious worldviews
- Development of skills in analysis, evaluation, and constructing arguments
- Engagement with contemporary ethical and philosophical questions
- Progression throughout KS4 regardless of GCSE choices

This would address the current anomaly where some pupils receive no RE after Year 9.

### Implications for Trust Practice

Whilst awaiting statutory reform, trusts can:
- Adopt the "National Entitlement" principle as a curricular aspiration
- Ensure Core RE provision is as ambitious as GCSE RS
- Document the entitlement clearly in curriculum policies
- Monitor the quality of Core RE as rigorously as examined provision

## Pedagogical Approaches at KS4

### For GCSE Religious Studies

**Depth over breadth**: Given the thematic structure of modern specifications, effective teaching prioritises depth of understanding over coverage of content. Rather than rushing through all six major world religions, teachers should ensure pupils develop sophisticated understanding of their chosen two.

**Developing evaluative skill**: GCSE assessment requires pupils to "evaluate" — this means constructing arguments with clear reasoning, not simply listing "for and against" points. Teachers should model evaluative discourse explicitly.

**Interleaving religious content**: Effective pedagogy connects Component 1 (religious study) with Component 2 (thematic study), showing how beliefs inform ethical positions rather than treating them as separate domains.

**Managing prescribed texts**: Specifications require reference to scripture and sacred texts. Teachers should develop pupils' confidence in using textual evidence appropriately, not merely quoting but interpreting and applying.

### For Core RE

**Philosophical enquiry**: Core RE benefits from philosophical pedagogy — using questioning, dialogue, and thought experiments to engage pupils in substantive thinking about meaning, value, and knowledge.

**Contemporary relevance**: Connecting religious and philosophical perspectives to current events maintains engagement whilst developing analytical skills.

**Dialogic teaching**: Creating classroom spaces for reasoned discussion of contentious issues, with clear ground rules and teacher facilitation.

**Assessment for learning**: Even without external assessment, Core RE should use formative assessment to check understanding and guide instruction.

## Common Misconceptions at KS4

### Pupil Misconceptions

| Misconception | Correction |
|--------------|------------|
| "All Christians believe the same thing" | Christianity encompasses diverse traditions (Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant) with significant doctrinal differences |
| "Religious people are not scientific" | Many scientists are religious; science and religion address different kinds of questions |
| "The Bible is one book written by one person" | The Bible is a library of diverse texts written across centuries by multiple authors |
| "Ethical decisions are just opinions" | Ethical reasoning uses criteria and principles; some arguments are better supported than others |
| "Atheists have no values" | Non-religious worldviews include robust ethical frameworks (humanism, utilitarianism, etc.) |

### Teacher Misconceptions

| Misconception | Correction |
|--------------|------------|
| "Offering GCSE RS satisfies statutory RE requirements" | Core RE remains compulsory for non-GCSE pupils |
| "Core RE doesn't need specialist teachers" | Ofsted findings show Core RE suffers from lack of subject expertise |
| "GCSE content can be delivered through PowerPoint and worksheets" | Effective RE requires dialogue, questioning, and conceptual development |
| "Theme E (crime and punishment) is just about what religions think" | Themes require understanding of secular law, philosophy, and social context |

## Quality Indicators for KS4 RE

### Self-Evaluation Questions for Departments

1. **Curriculum**: Do all pupils at KS4 receive RE appropriate to their needs, whether through GCSE or Core provision?

2. **Progression**: Is there a clear progression model from KS3 through KS4, with articulated knowledge and skills?

3. **Assessment**: Does assessment (formative and summative) accurately capture what pupils know and can do?

4. **Staffing**: Do both GCSE and Core RE benefit from specialist teaching where possible?

5. **Resources**: Are teaching materials sufficiently challenging, accurate, and representative of diverse viewpoints?

6. **Inclusion**: How does the school ensure withdrawn pupils have meaningful alternative provision?

### Ofsted-Aligned Evidence

Strong KS4 RE provision demonstrates:
- **Intent**: Clear rationale for curriculum structure, including the relationship between GCSE and Core RE
- **Implementation**: Effective pedagogy, appropriate resources, and knowledgeable teaching
- **Impact**: Pupils who can articulate religious and philosophical ideas with accuracy and nuance
