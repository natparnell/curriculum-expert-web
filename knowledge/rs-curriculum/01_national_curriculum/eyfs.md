High-quality picture books that represent diverse religious and cultural experiences are essential for EYFS RE. Useful titles include:

- **General Diversity:** "All Are Welcome" by Alexandra Penfold, "The Colours of Us" by Karen Katz
- **Christianity:** "The Christmas Story" by Brian Wildsmith, "Easter" by Jan Pienkowski
- **Islam:** "Golden Domes and Silver Lanterns" by Hena Khan, "Under the Ramadan Moon" by Sylvia Whitman
- **Judaism:** "Sammy Spider's First Hanukkah" by Sylvia Rouss, "The Passover Story" by Alison Greengard
- **Hinduism:** "The Story of Divaali" by Jatinder Verma, "Ganesha's Sweet Tooth" by Sanjay Patel
- **Sikhism:** "The Boy With Long Hair" by Pushi Kaur, "The Milk Miracle" by Kimi Gupta
- **Buddhism:** "The Buddha's Apprentice at Bedtime" by Nagaraja, "The Three Questions" by Jon Muth

Non-fiction texts that show children places of worship, celebrations, and practices are also valuable.

### Artefacts and Resources

Organisations such as RE Today, the National Association of Teachers of Religious Education (NATRE), and local SACREs provide:
- Artefact boxes for loan
- Images and posters
- Guidance on teaching RE in the early years
- Training and professional development

### Online Resources

- **RE Online:** Resources and guidance for teaching RE across all key stages
- **NATRE:** The National Association of Teachers of Religious Education provides resources and support
- **TrueTube:** Videos exploring religion and belief from young people's perspectives
- **BBC Bitesize:** Resources for learning about different religions

## Transition to Key Stage 1

The EYFS provides foundations for the more structured RE curriculum at Key Stage 1. The transition should:

- Build on children's experiences of exploring religion and belief
- Introduce more specific content about Christianity and one other religion (as required by most locally agreed syllabuses)
- Develop children's capacity to talk about what they have learned
- Continue to value the contributions of all children, regardless of background

By the end of Reception, children should have developed:
- Curiosity about religion and belief
- Positive attitudes towards religious and cultural diversity
- Some knowledge about the beliefs and practices of different communities
- Experience of encountering religious stories, artefacts, and celebrations

These foundations prepare children for the more systematic study of RE in Key Stage 1, where they will begin to learn in more depth about Christianity and at least one other religion.

## Challenges and Opportunities

### Challenges

**Lack of Confidence:** Some practitioners feel unsure about teaching RE, particularly if they have limited personal knowledge of religious traditions. This can be addressed through:
- Professional development and training
- Working with religious communities and SACREs
- Using high-quality resources that provide accurate information
- Recognising that the teacher's role is to facilitate exploration rather than to be an expert

**Sensitivity:** RE touches on deeply held beliefs and can be sensitive for families and staff. This can be addressed through:
- Clear policies and procedures
- Respectful dialogue with families
- Sensitivity to different perspectives
- Focus on educational aims rather than promoting any particular worldview

**Time and Priorities:** In a crowded curriculum, RE can sometimes be neglected. This can be addressed through:
- Integrating RE across the curriculum (stories, festivals, PSED)
- Recognising the contribution of RE to the EYFS curriculum goals
- Planning RE into the long-term and medium-term planning cycle

### Opportunities

**Natural Curiosity:** Young children are naturally curious about the world and the people around them. RE provides opportunities to channel this curiosity in productive ways.

**Diverse Communities:** Many early years settings are in diverse communities with rich religious and cultural resources available locally.

**Holistic Development:** RE contributes to all areas of the EYFS curriculum, including PSED (respect for others), literacy (stories and vocabulary), Understanding the World, and Expressive Arts and Design.

**Preparation for Life in Modern Britain:** RE in the EYFS supports children to develop the knowledge, understanding, and attitudes they need to live in a diverse society.

## Conclusion

RE in the Early Years Foundation Stage provides crucial foundations for children's developing understanding of religion and belief. Through the People, Culture and Communities Early Learning Goal, children are introduced to the diversity of religious and cultural communities in their local area and beyond.

Effective RE in the EYFS:
- Starts from children's own experiences and questions
- Uses story, celebration, and first-hand experience as key approaches
- Develops positive attitudes towards diversity
- Engages families and communities as partners
- Prepares children for the more structured RE curriculum of Key Stage 1

By the end of Reception, children should have developed curiosity about religion and belief, positive attitudes towards religious and cultural diversity, and some foundational knowledge about the beliefs and practices of different communities. These outcomes prepare children not only for their continuing education but for life as informed, respectful, and open-minded citizens in a diverse society.

The early years are a crucial time for developing attitudes and dispositions that will last a lifetime. The way that RE is approached in the EYFS—through exploration, celebration, and respectful encounter—establishes patterns of thinking and relating that can support children throughout their lives in our religiously diverse world.
