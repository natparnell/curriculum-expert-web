## History and Founding

### Origins in Teacher Training College Closures

The Trust's origins lie in the turbulent period of educational restructuring during the 1970s, specifically the so-called "massacre of the colleges of education" that saw numerous teacher training institutions closed or merged as part of wider reforms to teacher education in England and Wales. Two Church of England colleges—Culham College in Oxfordshire and St Gabriel's College in Southwark, London—were among those affected by these closures.

**Culham College** had been founded in 1852 by Bishop Samuel Wilberforce and had established itself over more than a century as a significant institution for training teachers, particularly in religious education. Its campus near Abingdon in Oxfordshire had developed a strong reputation for excellence in preparing teachers for Church of England schools and for contributing to the professional development of RE specialists. The college's location in Oxfordshire gave it connections with the University of Oxford and an academic character that influenced its approach to teacher education. The closure of Culham College represented not merely the loss of a training facility but the potential dissipation of decades of expertise, resources, networks, and institutional commitment to religious education.

**St Gabriel's College**, located in Camberwell, Southwark, had similarly developed a strong reputation for teacher education with a particular focus on religious education, spiritual development, and the preparation of teachers for London schools. The college had been an important centre for developing innovative approaches to RE and for training teachers who would serve in diverse urban contexts. Its location in South London meant it served a very different constituency from Culham, with trainees preparing to work in multicultural, multi-faith urban environments. The closure of both institutions in the late 1970s raised serious questions about what would happen to the accumulated assets, expertise, and mission of these Church of England foundations.

Rather than allowing these resources to be lost or diverted to other purposes, the Church of England and the college trustees recognised an opportunity to transform the closure into a new beginning. The assets of these colleges represented not just financial value but embodied decades of commitment to religious education. Converting these assets into charitable foundations dedicated to supporting RE would ensure that the original mission continued, albeit in a new form appropriate to the changed educational landscape.

### Establishment of the Trusts

Following the closure of these colleges, the assets were repurposed to create charitable foundations dedicated to continuing the educational mission of the original institutions in new forms:

- **St Gabriel's Trust** was established in **1977** from the assets of St Gabriel's College. The Trust was created with charitable objects focused on promoting religious education through grants, research support, and professional development. The wisdom of the original trustees in ensuring that college assets would revert to charitable purposes proved crucial. A particularly astute legal provision had been included in the original transfer of St Gabriel's College to Goldsmiths College: should Goldsmiths ever wish to relinquish the buildings, these would revert to the St Gabriel's trustees at the original price. When the college closed, this provision enabled the trustees to sell the property to another educational institution, thereby providing the Trust with a significant charitable endowment that would sustain its work for decades.

- **Culham Educational Foundation** was established in **1980** from the assets of Culham College. The Foundation similarly took on the mission of supporting religious education through funding research, providing grants to teachers, and developing resources for the RE community. The Oxfordshire location of Culham College and its connections with the University of Oxford had given it a particular academic character, and the new Foundation sought to maintain these scholarly connections whilst serving the wider RE profession.

These two organisations operated separately for over three decades but shared a common commitment to supporting religious education through research, professional development, and direct grants to teachers. Both were endowed foundations, meaning they derived their income from investment returns rather than continuous fundraising, and both focused on serving the RE community through strategic grant-making and support for innovation.

### The Merger and Modern Era

The modern **Culham St Gabriel's Trust** was formed from the union of these two predecessor organisations, combining their resources, expertise, and networks to create a more substantial and coherent voice for RE. The merged Trust retains its status as an **endowed charitable foundation** (registered charity number 309671), meaning it derives its income primarily from investment returns on its original endowment rather than relying on continuous fundraising or government funding.

The merger represented a recognition that the challenges facing religious education in the twenty-first century required coordinated, strategic responses that could draw on substantial resources and expertise. By combining forces, the merged Trust was able to pool financial resources, combine networks and expertise, speak with a stronger voice in national debates about RE, develop sustained programmes rather than one-off grants, and build professional capacity across the RE sector.

The Trust's charitable objects, as registered with the Charity Commission, reflect its comprehensive mission:

1. The promotion of higher and further education, life-long learning and training for RE professionals
2. The promotion of research in, and development of, religious education
3. Making grants to beneficiaries in need of financial assistance for education
4. Providing financial or other assistance to institutions of higher or further education
5. Promoting religious education for the public benefit

## Funding Model and Financial Structure

### Endowment-Based Income

As an endowed foundation, Culham St Gabriel's Trust operates on a fundamentally different financial model from many other educational charities. Rather than raising funds through public donations, corporate partnerships, or government grants, the Trust derives the majority of its income from **returns on its invested endowment**.

This endowment-based model provides several significant advantages that shape the Trust's capacity and approach:

**Independence**: Because the Trust does not depend on continuous fundraising or external funding agreements, it can pursue its mission without being beholden to particular donors, political agendas, or short-term funding cycles. This independence allows the Trust to support controversial or innovative projects, to speak freely in policy debates, and to maintain a consistent focus on its charitable objects regardless of changing political or educational fashions.

**Stability**: Investment returns, whilst variable with market conditions, provide a more predictable income stream than fundraising-dependent organisations. This stability enables the Trust to make multi-year commitments, to plan strategically, and to provide reliable support for ongoing programmes.

**Long-term thinking**: The Trust can commit to multi-year projects and strategic initiatives with confidence in continued support. Unlike project-funded organisations that must constantly seek new funding, the Trust can invest in building capacity, developing resources, and supporting career pathways knowing that its funding base will endure.

**Risk-taking**: The ability to fund innovative, experimental, or controversial projects that might struggle to attract conventional funding. The Trust can support unproven ideas, early-stage research, and speculative initiatives that have the potential to transform practice.

### Grant-Making Philosophy

The Trust's grant-making strategy reflects its commitment to both immediate impact and long-term sector development. The Trust operates several distinct funding streams:

**Project Grants** (up to £30,000): These grants support research projects, curriculum development initiatives, professional development programmes, and innovative teaching approaches. The Trust particularly welcomes applications for small innovative projects or seed-corn funding, larger research projects with significant potential impact, initiatives that build professional networks, and projects that bridge academic research and classroom practice.

**3forRE Masters Scholarships**: Substantial funding for RE professionals pursuing postgraduate qualifications, typically up to £4,000 per scholar. This programme recognises that building subject expertise at the postgraduate level strengthens the entire profession.

**Responsive Funding**: The Trust maintains flexibility to respond to emerging opportunities, crises, or sector-wide needs as they arise. This might include funding for urgent research, support for new organisations, or rapid response to policy developments.

### Anniversary and Special Initiatives

To mark its tenth anniversary in 2022, the Trust launched special initiatives including **10th Anniversary Grant Awards** of £1,000 each for ten innovative projects, special funding rounds focused on emerging priorities, and reflective work examining the Trust's impact.

## Major Programmes and Initiatives

### 3forRE Masters Scholarship Programme

The **3forRE Scheme** represents one of the Trust's flagship initiatives, providing substantial financial support for RE professionals pursuing Masters-level qualifications. This programme recognises that high-quality RE depends on teachers with deep subject knowledge, research literacy, and the capacity to engage critically with educational theory and practice.

**Funding Available**: The programme provides up to £4,000 towards tuition fees for part-time or full-time Masters programmes relevant to religion and worldviews education. This funding can make the difference between being able to pursue postgraduate study and having to forgo the opportunity due to financial constraints.

**Eligibility Criteria**: To be eligible, applicants must be working in RE, Religion and Worldviews Education (RVE), or Religious and Moral Education (RME). Suitable roles include teachers, teaching assistants, higher-level teaching assistants (HLTAs), advisers, educators, or researchers. Both aspiring trainees and experienced practitioners are eligible. Applicants must demonstrate commitment to continuing in RE-related work after completing their studies and have secured a place on a relevant Masters programme at a recognised UK university.

**Application Process**: Applications typically open annually with a closing date in June (for example, 23rd June 2023 for the 2023/24 academic year). The application requires two referees who can attest to the applicant's commitment and potential. For serving teachers, a headteacher agreement form is required confirming support for the applicant's professional development. A personal statement outlining how the Masters will benefit the applicant's practice and the wider RE community is also required, along with evidence of having secured a place on a relevant programme.

**Programme Leadership**: The Masters Scholarship Programme is led by the Education and Programmes Manager, Fiona Moss, with oversight from the Trust's Lead Consultant for Research.

**Strategic Significance**: The 3forRE programme addresses a critical challenge in RE: the subject's status as a non-statutory component of Initial Teacher Training in many programmes means that RE specialists often enter the profession without the depth of preparation enjoyed by colleagues in core subjects. By supporting postgraduate study, the Trust builds subject knowledge and pedagogical expertise, develops research literacy and engagement with academic discourse, creates a network of highly qualified RE professionals, signals the value and intellectual rigour of the subject, and provides career progression pathways.

### Teach:RE Professional Development Programme

**Teach:RE** is the Trust's comprehensive professional development initiative, offering free, quality-assured, online courses for anyone involved in teaching religion and worldviews. The programme is endorsed and certified by the National Association of Teachers of Religious Education (NATRE), providing external validation of its quality and relevance.

**Course Offerings**: The Teach:RE portfolio includes courses tailored to different career stages. For aspiring trainees, Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) courses support those applying to Initial Teacher Training programmes, with preparation for PGCE RE programmes and foundation modules covering the basics of RE pedagogy, curriculum structures, and subject content. For early career teachers, Primary ECT support courses cover essential knowledge for teaching RE in primary settings, where specialists may have limited training. Secondary ECT programmes address the specific challenges of RE in the secondary context, including GCSE and A-Level preparation, alongside core concepts in religion and worldviews education. For experienced teachers and leaders, advanced modules cover curriculum design and assessment in RE, leadership in RE supporting coordinators and subject leaders, and specialist topics such as the Worldviews approach, teaching controversial issues, inclusion and diversity in RE, and developing pupils' personal worldviews.

**Course Characteristics**: All courses are delivered online through the dedicated Teach:RE platform (teachre.co.uk), allowing participants to study at their own pace, fitting professional development around busy teaching schedules. Participants can pause and return to work across multiple sessions, accommodating the unpredictable nature of school life. Materials can be accessed from any device, enabling learning at home, at school, or on the move. Modules are typically completed in 60-90 minutes, respecting teachers' time constraints whilst providing substantial content.

**Quality Assurance**: Courses are developed by subject experts with academic credentials and classroom experience. They are peer-reviewed for accuracy and appropriateness, and regularly updated to reflect current developments in the field. The NATRE endorsement provides external validation of quality and ensures alignment with professional standards.

**Cost**: All Teach:RE courses are **free of charge**, removing financial barriers to professional development and ensuring that budget constraints do not limit access to high-quality training.

**Impact and Reach**: The Teach:RE programme has become a cornerstone of RE professional development, particularly valuable for teachers in small schools or isolated departments, primary teachers with limited RE specialist training, schools with high staff turnover or reliance on non-specialist teachers, and educators seeking to develop their practice without committing to formal qualifications.

### Research Grants Programme

The Trust's grant-making programme supports a diverse portfolio of research and development projects that advance the theory and practice of religion and worldviews education. Current and recent projects illustrate the breadth of work funded.

**Curriculum and Pedagogy Research** includes projects exploring decolonised approaches to teaching religion and worldviews, challenging Eurocentric assumptions and diversifying perspectives. Research into effective pedagogies for particular topics or age groups builds the evidence base for teaching specific content. Development of new curriculum resources and frameworks that can be shared across the sector ensures research translates into practical classroom application.

**Professional Development Innovation** encompasses experimental approaches to teacher training and support, testing new models of CPD. Projects building professional networks and communities of practice sustain teachers beyond initial training. Initiatives addressing recruitment and retention challenges in RE tackle the subject's workforce issues through innovative solutions.

**Pupil Voice and Engagement** research investigates pupils' perspectives on RE, understanding how young people experience and value the subject. Projects develop pupil-centred approaches that respect young people's agency in exploring worldviews. Work on diversity, inclusion, and representation in RE curricula ensures all pupils see themselves reflected in the subject.

**Digital and Multimedia Resources** development includes video resources such as the "Religious Imaginations Educational Video Series" introducing major world religions for ages 16 to adult. Online platforms and tools for RE teaching enhance engagement and understanding. Virtual exchange and dialogue projects connect pupils across different contexts.

**Grant Characteristics**: Typical grants range from small awards of £1,000-£5,000 for discrete projects to larger awards of £20,000-£30,000 for substantial research programmes. The Trust emphasises clear articulation of impact on RE practice, sustainability beyond the funding period, dissemination and sharing of learning with the wider community, and collaboration between researchers and practitioners bridging academic research and classroom practice.

## The Worldviews Project and the Commission on Religious Education

### The Commission on Religious Education (2016-2018)

In 2016, the Religious Education Council of England and Wales sponsored an independent Commission on Religious Education (CoRE) to review the state of RE and make recommendations for its future. The Commission, comprising fourteen professionals with complementary expertise in RE and religion in public life, conducted a comprehensive two-year review examining evidence from across the sector and beyond.

Culham St Gabriel's Trust was closely involved with CoRE both as a member of the Religious Education Council and through the active participation of its staff and trustees in the Commission's work. The Trust provided funding support, contributed to discussions, and helped ensure that the Commission's work was grounded in the realities of classroom practice as well as academic research.

### The Final Report: "Religion and Worldviews: The Way Forward"

Published in September 2018, the Commission's final report proposed a fundamental reconceptualisation of the subject that has shaped debates about RE ever since.

**The "Religion and Worldviews" Approach**: The report recommended renaming and reframing the subject as "Religion and Worldviews" to better reflect the inclusion of non-religious worldviews (humanism, secularism, atheism) alongside religious traditions, the recognition that "religion" itself is a contested category, and the diversity of ways humans make sense of existence, find meaning, and construct ethical frameworks.

**Key Recommendations**:
1. A **National Entitlement** to religion and worldviews education for all pupils, regardless of school type, ensuring every child receives high-quality RE
2. A review of the legal framework, including the collective worship requirement, to bring legislation in line with contemporary educational needs
3. Improved initial teacher training and professional development to ensure all RE teachers are well-qualified and supported
4. New national content standards to provide clarity about what should be taught
5. A stronger evidence base for policy and practice through sustained research investment

### Culham St Gabriel's Role in Implementation

Following the CoRE report, Culham St Gabriel's Trust committed significant resources to supporting the shift towards a Religion and Worldviews approach through multiple strategies.

**Advocacy and Communication**: The Trust has published resources explaining the Worldviews approach for teachers, parents, and governors. Staff and trustees contribute to national debates through articles, blog posts, and conference presentations. The Trust collaborates with the Religious Education Council on implementation strategies, helping translate the Commission's vision into practical reality.

**Research and Development**: The Trust funds projects exploring what a Worldviews approach looks like in practice in different school contexts. It supports the development of curriculum materials aligned with the new vision, ensuring teachers have resources to implement change. The Trust has commissioned research into stakeholder reception of the CoRE proposals, understanding how different groups respond to the recommended changes.

**Professional Development**: Teach:RE modules on the Worldviews approach help teachers understand and implement the new paradigm. The Trust supports teachers and departments transitioning to new curricular models, providing guidance and resources for managing change. Staff contribute to the discourse on knowledge, pedagogy, and curriculum in Worldviews education, shaping how the approach is understood and enacted.

**National Content Standard Support**: When the National Content Standard for RE was published in 2024, the Trust immediately committed to supporting schools and syllabus creators in using it to develop excellence in RE. This support includes guidance materials, training, and resources to help educators engage with the new standards.

### Ongoing Position

The Trust maintains that the Religion and Worldviews approach represents the best way forward for the subject, arguing that it provides academic rigour while remaining accessible to all pupils, respects the increasing diversity of belief and non-belief in contemporary society, maintains space for serious engagement with religious traditions while recognising their contested nature, and offers a coherent conceptual framework for curriculum design.

However, the Trust also recognises the challenges of implementation and continues to support diverse approaches to RE that maintain high standards and respect legal frameworks. The Trust acknowledges that change in education takes time and that schools need support to transition to new approaches.

## RE Quality Mark

### Overview and Purpose

The **RE Quality Mark (REQM)** is a national accreditation scheme that recognises, celebrates, and raises the status of high-quality religious education in schools. Culham St Gabriel's Trust provides significant support for the RE Quality Mark, particularly its research element, recognising that external validation of quality helps schools demonstrate the value of their RE provision to governors, parents, and inspectors.

The RE Quality Mark operates across **four strands** assessed at Bronze, Silver, or Gold levels:

1. **Curriculum**: The coherence, breadth, and depth of the RE curriculum, including how well it prepares pupils for life in a diverse society
2. **Teaching**: The quality of pedagogy and classroom practice, including how teachers engage pupils and develop their understanding
3. **Learning**: Pupil outcomes, engagement, and progress, demonstrating the impact of RE on young people's knowledge, skills, and attitudes
4. **Leadership**: Strategic vision, subject leadership, and whole-school commitment to RE, showing how the subject is valued and supported at all levels

The tiered structure allows schools to recognise their current achievement and identify clear pathways for development. Bronze level recognises good practice, Silver indicates excellent provision, and Gold represents outstanding RE that can inspire others.

### The Assessment Process

Schools applying for the RE Quality Mark engage in a rigorous self-evaluation and external validation process that itself serves as valuable professional development.

**Self-Evaluation**: Schools complete a detailed evidence form covering 29 areas of reflection, with descriptors at Bronze, Silver, and Gold levels for each. This process prompts systematic reflection on RE provision, helping schools identify strengths and areas for development.

**Pupil Voice**: The assessment includes gathering perspectives from pupils, recognising that high-quality RE should be evident in pupils' experiences and learning, not merely in documentation. Pupils' views on what they learn and how they are taught form an essential part of the evidence base.

**External Validation**: Applications are reviewed by trained assessors who evaluate evidence against the criteria. These assessors are experienced RE professionals who understand both the criteria and the realities of school life.

**Award and Recognition**: Successful schools receive accreditation at the appropriate level, along with feedback and recommendations for further development. The award can be used in school communications, on websites, and in reports to demonstrate commitment to RE excellence.

### Culham St Gabriel's Contribution

The Trust's support for the RE Quality Mark includes contributing to the evidence base underlying the Mark's criteria through research, supporting assessor training and development to ensure consistent high-quality assessment, advocating for the Mark as a tool for school improvement and subject status, and contributing to the ongoing evolution of the Mark to reflect developments in the subject such as the Worldviews approach.

### Impact on Schools

For schools, the RE Quality Mark provides external validation of good practice by an independent body, a framework for evaluating and developing RE provision, evidence of commitment to RE that can be shared with governors, parents, and inspectors, a professional development opportunity through the self-evaluation process, and clear progression pathways through the tiered structure.

## Current Projects and Strategic Priorities

### Decolonising Religious Education

A significant emerging focus for the Trust is supporting efforts to **decolonise religious education**—examining how curricula, resources, and pedagogies can move beyond Eurocentric perspectives and better reflect the diversity of religious and worldview traditions on their own terms. Recent funded projects in this area explore postcolonial approaches to curriculum design, challenging assumptions embedded in traditional RE resources, and developing teaching materials that represent traditions authentically rather than through Western frameworks.

This work recognises that religious education has often approached non-Christian traditions through Christian or secular Western lenses, potentially distorting understanding. Decolonising RE involves questioning these frames and developing approaches that take seriously the internal diversity and self-understanding of different traditions.

### Supporting Diverse School Contexts

The Trust increasingly focuses on how RE can thrive in diverse school contexts including faith schools, community schools, academies, and independent schools. Different contexts present distinct opportunities and challenges for RE, and the Trust's work aims to support excellence across this diversity rather than imposing a single model.

### Evidence-Based Practice

Building the evidence base for RE remains a strategic priority. The Trust funds research that investigates what works in RE classrooms, how pupils learn about religions and worldviews, and what makes RE meaningful and transformative for young people. This commitment to evidence-based practice helps move RE beyond ideological debates towards grounded understanding of effective teaching and learning.

### Teacher Retention and Recruitment

Addressing challenges in teacher retention and recruitment represents an ongoing priority. The Trust's funding for Masters scholarships, professional development, and research into workforce issues all contribute to building a sustainable, high-quality RE teaching profession.
