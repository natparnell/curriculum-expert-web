# Ofsted and Religious Education

## Overview

Ofsted's engagement with religious education (RE) has intensified significantly since the introduction of the education inspection framework (EIF) in 2019. Through the publication of a research review in 2021 and a comprehensive subject report in 2024, Ofsted has established clear expectations for what constitutes high-quality RE in schools. This knowledge file synthesises Ofsted's findings, recommendations, and inspection expectations to support curriculum leaders and teachers in understanding and meeting these standards.

## The 2021 Research Review: Three Pillars of Progression

### Background and Purpose

In May 2021, Ofsted published its research review for religious education as part of a series examining different subjects across the curriculum. The review synthesised current research and Ofsted's inspection evidence to identify the factors that contribute to high-quality RE. It established a conceptual framework that has subsequently shaped Ofsted's approach to inspecting and evaluating RE in schools.

The research review was particularly significant because it represented Ofsted's first substantial attempt to define what constitutes academic quality in RE, distinguishing the subject's contribution to pupils' education from its role in personal development. This distinction was crucial in establishing RE as an intellectually rigorous subject with its own distinct body of knowledge.

### The Three Types of Knowledge

The research review identified three types of knowledge that should form the foundation of the RE curriculum. These have become known as the "three pillars of progression" and are central to Ofsted's evaluation of RE quality.

#### Substantive Knowledge

Substantive knowledge in RE refers to the content that pupils learn about religious and non-religious traditions. This includes:

- **Core concepts**: The fundamental ideas that underpin religious and non-religious worldviews, such as the nature of divinity, the purpose of human life, and the relationship between humanity and the sacred
- **Beliefs and practices**: What adherents believe and how they express those beliefs through worship, ritual, and daily life
- **Diversity within traditions**: Understanding that religions are not monolithic but contain internal diversity, difference, and debate
- **Sacred texts and sources**: The foundational texts, oral traditions, and authoritative sources that shape religious traditions
- **Historical and cultural contexts**: How religious traditions have developed and been shaped by historical, geographical, and cultural factors

Ofsted emphasised that substantive knowledge should not be confused with "mere facts." The most powerful substantive knowledge enables pupils to understand complex phenomena and make meaningful connections between ideas. It provides the foundation for all subsequent learning in RE.

#### Ways of Knowing

The second pillar, ways of knowing, refers to how knowledge about religion is established, contested, and understood. This disciplinary knowledge enables pupils to understand how claims about religion are made, evaluated, and interpreted. Key elements include:

- **Theological approaches**: How believers understand and interpret their own traditions, including methods of scriptural interpretation, reasoning, and reflection
- **Philosophical enquiry**: The use of philosophical tools and methods to examine religious claims, arguments, and concepts
- **Social scientific study**: How scholars from disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, and psychology study religion as a human phenomenon
- **Historical investigation**: Understanding how religious traditions have developed and changed over time through historical methods
- **Textual interpretation**: Skills in reading, interpreting, and critically engaging with sacred texts and other religious sources

Ofsted noted that pupils should learn that these different approaches may lead to different conclusions and that religious and non-religious traditions themselves have distinct ways of establishing truth and authority.

#### Personal Knowledge

The third pillar, personal knowledge, recognises that pupils bring their own experiences, assumptions, and perspectives to the study of RE. This includes:

- **Self-understanding**: Pupils developing awareness of their own beliefs, values, and assumptions
- **Critical reflection**: The ability to examine one's own responses to religious and non-religious ideas
- **Perspective-taking**: Understanding how one's own position might affect interpretation and engagement with others' beliefs
- **Respectful engagement**: Developing the disposition to engage with diverse views constructively and respectfully

Ofsted stressed that personal knowledge should not be confused with personal belief. The focus is on developing pupils' awareness of their own perspective and how it shapes their understanding, not on promoting or undermining any particular belief position.

### The Relationship Between the Three Pillars

The research review emphasised that these three types of knowledge are interdependent. Substantive knowledge provides the content for study, ways of knowing provide the tools for engaging with that content academically, and personal knowledge enables pupils to recognise their own position in relation to what they are studying. High-quality RE weaves these three strands together coherently.

## The 2024 Subject Report: "Deep and Meaningful?"

### Methodology and Scope

In April 2024, Ofsted published "Deep and meaningful? The religious education subject report," presenting findings from 50 research visits conducted between September 2021 and April 2023. The report examined RE in 25 primary schools and 25 secondary schools, including provision from Reception Year through to sixth form.

The report built upon the 2021 research review, evaluating the extent to which schools had implemented its principles. It examined curriculum, pedagogy, assessment, organisation, and teacher education, providing a comprehensive picture of RE quality across England.

### Key Findings: Persistent Weaknesses

The 2024 report painted a concerning picture of RE in many schools. Several persistent weaknesses were identified that had not improved significantly since Ofsted's previous subject report in 2013.

#### Lack of Substantive Depth

Ofsted found that the RE curriculum often lacked sufficient substance to prepare pupils for life in a complex, multi-religious, and multi-secular society. Many curriculums were superficially broad, covering many religions in equal measure but providing little depth. This "equal slices of a pie" approach resulted in pupils remembering very little of what they had studied.

Where curriculums prioritised depth over breadth, pupils generally learned much more. However, this approach was relatively rare. Most pupils were not developing the sophisticated understanding needed to engage meaningfully with religious and non-religious traditions as they appear in the world.

#### Limited Disciplinary and Personal Knowledge

The report found that schools rarely enabled pupils to systematically build disciplinary knowledge (ways of knowing) or personal knowledge. RE lessons often focused narrowly on substantive knowledge without developing pupils' understanding of how that knowledge is established or encouraging reflection on their own perspective.

This limitation meant that pupils were often unable to engage with religion as a living, contested phenomenon. They learned about what religious people believe and do without understanding the complexity, diversity, and contested nature of religious traditions.

#### Compartmentalisation and Simplification

Where RE was weaker, knowledge was often overly and uncritically compartmentalised. Pupils were presented with over-simplistic assertions about religious traditions, frequently based on visible entities such as places of worship, festivals, and artefacts. This approach failed to capture the lived experience of religion or the diversity within traditions.

The report noted a particular tendency to present religions as uniform and static, ignoring internal diversity, historical development, and contemporary variation. Pupils were rarely helped to understand how religious traditions have been shaped by and continue to respond to historical and cultural contexts.

#### Misconceptions About Neutrality

Ofsted identified a profound misconception among some leaders and teachers that "teaching from a neutral stance" equates to teaching a non-religious worldview. This misunderstanding led some schools to avoid engaging seriously with religious content, mistakenly believing that doing so would compromise neutrality.

The report clarified that neutral teaching in RE means presenting religious and non-religious traditions fairly and accurately, not avoiding religious content or privileging secular perspectives. Academic neutrality requires engagement with substantive religious content, not its avoidance.

#### Poor Assessment Practice

Even where schools had assessment systems in place, these rarely provided assurance that pupils were learning and remembering increasingly complex content over time. Assessment often focused on generic skills or personal responses rather than checking whether pupils had acquired specific substantive or disciplinary knowledge.

Some schools were wisely focusing on curriculum development before introducing complex assessment systems. However, even mature assessment practice rarely tracked the development of the three types of knowledge identified in the research review.

#### Inadequate Curriculum Time

The report identified insufficient curriculum time as a significant barrier to high-quality RE. When RE was squeezed into tutor time, delivered through assemblies, or otherwise weakly framed, it could not support an ambitious curriculum that ensured pupils "know more, remember more and do more."

Regular, timetabled RE lessons were associated with better pupil recall and understanding. Long gaps between lessons hindered pupils' ability to build and retain knowledge.

#### Weak Non-Examined Provision

In the secondary phase, most statutory non-examined RE was limited and of poor quality. A notable proportion of schools did not meet the statutory requirement to teach RE to pupils at all stages of their schooling. Where RE was compulsory only for pupils taking public examinations, the majority of students received inadequate RE provision.

#### Premature Focus on Examination Skills

The content of some secondary curriculums was restricted by assumptions about what pupils needed for public examinations at the end of key stage 4. In many cases, teachers introduced examination skills too early, significantly limiting the range and types of RE content taught. This narrowed the curriculum and prevented pupils from encountering the full breadth of RE as a subject.

### Teacher Education and Subject Knowledge

The report identified weak teacher subject knowledge as a fundamental barrier to high-quality RE. Although a few teachers had received subject-based professional development, the overwhelming majority had not. Given the complexity of the subject and the kind of misconceptions that pupils were left with, Ofsted identified this as a significant concern.

The absence of coordinated subject support, comparable to subject hubs in English and mathematics, has compounded this problem. Teachers moving between schools may encounter different expectations and curriculums, making it difficult to build and maintain subject expertise.

### What Has Changed Since 2013?

The 2024 report noted that many of the problems identified in Ofsted's 2013 subject report persisted. The "unrealised potential" of RE that was identified a decade earlier remained unrealised. Key changes in the educational landscape, including the growth of multi-academy trusts, had added complexity without resolving fundamental issues.

The legal position of RE remained unchanged: still mandatory but outside the national curriculum, still locally determined for maintained schools. The withdrawal of bursaries for RE trainee teachers had contributed to recruitment problems, and the capacity of local authorities to support RE had reduced.

## Ofsted Deep Dive Expectations

### The Deep Dive Methodology

Under the EIF, Ofsted inspectors conduct "deep dives" into specific subjects to evaluate the quality of education. These deep dives examine:

- **Intent**: The curriculum thinking behind what is taught, including the selection and sequencing of content
- **Implementation**: How the curriculum is taught and enacted in classrooms
- **Impact**: What pupils have learned and can do as a result of the curriculum

Deep dives typically include lesson observations, scrutiny of pupils' work, discussions with pupils, and interviews with curriculum leaders and teachers.

### Changes to Deep Dive Policy (2024)

From September 2024, Ofsted announced that ungraded inspections would no longer include subject deep dives. Deep dives continue in graded inspections but have been removed from ungraded (section 8) inspections to reduce burdens on schools.

This change was announced by Sir Martyn Oliver following feedback from school leaders, particularly from small schools where deep dives were resource-intensive.

### What Inspectors Look for in RE Deep Dives

#### Curriculum Intent

Inspectors evaluating RE curriculum intent look for:

- **Clear curriculum thinking**: Leaders should be able to articulate why particular content has been selected and how it builds progressively
- **Appropriate balance**: Evidence of attention to all three types of knowledge (substantive, ways of knowing, personal knowledge)
- **Coherent sequencing**: Content should be organised so that pupils build knowledge incrementally, with new learning building on prior learning
- **Depth over breadth**: A curriculum that prioritises deep understanding of fewer topics over superficial coverage of many
- **Ambitious endpoints**: Clear expectations for what pupils should know and be able to do at each key stage

Inspectors will want to see that curriculum decisions are based on educational rationale rather than inherited schemes or unexamined assumptions.

#### Curriculum Implementation

In evaluating implementation, inspectors look for:

- **Strong subject knowledge**: Teachers who understand the content they are teaching and can explain it clearly
- **Appropriate pedagogy**: Teaching methods that support the learning of specific RE content, not generic approaches applied indiscriminately
- **Effective use of time**: Sufficient curriculum time allocated to RE, with regular lessons rather than sporadic coverage
- **Accurate presentation**: Content presented accurately, without oversimplification or stereotyping
- **Engagement with sources**: Pupils engaging directly with religious texts, artefacts, and sources, not just secondary descriptions

Inspectors will observe lessons, looking for evidence that teaching is enabling pupils to learn the intended curriculum.

#### Curriculum Impact

To evaluate impact, inspectors examine:

- **Pupils' work**: Books and other evidence showing what pupils have produced and how their work develops over time
- **Pupil voice**: Discussions with pupils about what they have learned, remember, and understand
- **Assessment information**: How teachers know what pupils have learned and how this informs future teaching

Inspectors are looking for evidence that pupils are knowing more, remembering more, and being able to do more as a result of the RE curriculum.

### Common Deep Dive Questions

Curriculum leaders preparing for RE deep dives should be ready to answer questions such as:

- What is the rationale for your curriculum choices in RE?
- How does your curriculum build knowledge progressively across key stages?
- How do you ensure coverage of all three types of knowledge identified in the research review?
- What do you want pupils to know and be able to do by the end of each key stage?
- How do you support non-specialist teachers to develop their subject knowledge?
- How do you know whether pupils are learning and remembering the curriculum?
- How does your RE curriculum prepare pupils for life in a multi-religious and multi-secular society?

## Practical Implications for Schools

### Curriculum Design

Schools should review their RE curriculum against the three pillars framework, ensuring that all three types of knowledge are present and coherently integrated. Key considerations include:

- **Selecting content for depth**: Prioritising deep engagement with fewer topics rather than superficial coverage
- **Building progression**: Ensuring that curriculum sequencing enables pupils to build knowledge incrementally
- **Integrating the pillars**: Planning how substantive, disciplinary, and personal knowledge will be developed in relation to each other
- **Avoiding simplification**: Ensuring that content captures the complexity and diversity of religious traditions

### Assessment Development

Schools developing RE assessment should focus on:

- **Checking specific knowledge**: Assessment that checks whether pupils have learned specific curriculum content
- **Tracking over time**: Systems that track whether pupils are knowing and remembering more as they progress
- **Avoiding generic assessment**: Resisting the temptation to assess generic skills rather than specific RE knowledge
- **Informing teaching**: Using assessment information to inform curriculum implementation and address gaps

### Teacher Development

Addressing the subject knowledge gap identified by Ofsted requires:

- **Subject-specific CPD**: Professional development focused on RE subject knowledge, not just generic pedagogy
- **Supporting non-specialists**: Structured support for non-specialist teachers, including clear curriculum guidance and access to resources
- **Building expertise**: Opportunities for RE specialists to deepen their expertise and lead curriculum development
- **Collaborative working**: Working with other schools, trusts, and subject organisations to share expertise

### Addressing Time and Statutory Requirements

Schools should review:

- **Curriculum time**: Whether RE has sufficient time on the timetable to deliver an ambitious curriculum
- **Statutory compliance**: Whether all pupils are receiving their statutory entitlement to RE at all key stages
- **Non-examined provision**: The quality of RE for pupils not taking public examinations in the subject

## Recommendations for Curriculum Leaders

Based on Ofsted's findings, curriculum leaders should prioritise:

1. **Curriculum review**: Conduct a thorough review of the RE curriculum against the three pillars framework, identifying gaps and areas for development

2. **Depth over breadth**: Consider whether the curriculum allows for deep engagement with content or tries to cover too much superficially

3. **Assessment of impact**: Develop approaches to checking whether pupils are learning and remembering the curriculum, focusing on specific knowledge

4. **Subject knowledge development**: Prioritise professional development that builds teachers' RE subject knowledge, particularly for non-specialists

5. **Time allocation**: Ensure that RE has sufficient curriculum time to deliver an ambitious curriculum

6. **Avoiding misconceptions**: Address any misconceptions about neutrality that might be leading to avoidance of substantive religious content

7. **Engagement with sources**: Ensure that pupils have opportunities to engage directly with religious texts, artefacts, and sources

## Conclusion

Ofsted's research review and subject report have established clear expectations for high-quality RE. The three pillars of substantive knowledge, ways of knowing, and personal knowledge provide a framework for curriculum design and evaluation. The 2024 subject report's finding that much RE remains weak, and that problems identified a decade ago persist, should be a call to action for the sector.

Meeting Ofsted's expectations requires careful attention to curriculum design, implementation, and assessment. It requires building teacher subject knowledge and ensuring sufficient curriculum time. Most fundamentally, it requires treating RE as an academically rigorous subject with its own distinct body of knowledge, capable of preparing pupils for life in a complex, multi-religious, and multi-secular society.

The message from Ofsted is clear: RE has the potential to make a major contribution to pupils' education, but this potential remains largely unrealised. Schools that take the three pillars seriously, design coherent curriculums with depth and progression, and invest in teacher subject knowledge can deliver the high-quality RE that all pupils deserve.
