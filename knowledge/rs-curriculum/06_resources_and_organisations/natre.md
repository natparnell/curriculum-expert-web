# NATRE: The National Association of Teachers of Religious Education

## Introduction and Overview

NATRE (the National Association of Teachers of Religious Education) stands as the leading subject teacher association dedicated to supporting and empowering professionals in the field of Religious Education (RE), Religious Studies (RS), and religion and worldviews education in England. Founded by teachers for teachers, NATRE has established itself as the authoritative voice for RE professionals at national level, providing comprehensive resources, professional development opportunities, and advocacy for the subject.

The association operates through a democratic structure comprising an Executive Committee of approximately 25 members, including practising primary and secondary teachers alongside co-opted specialists. This governance model ensures that NATRE remains grounded in classroom realities whilst maintaining strategic influence at policy level. The organisation works in partnership with RE Today Services, which provides administrative and publishing support, enabling NATRE to focus on its core mission of teacher support and subject advocacy.

NATRE's membership extends across all phases of education—from Early Career Teachers (ECTs) and Initial Teacher Training (ITT) students through to experienced subject leaders and headteachers. With over 280 affiliated local groups connecting more than 2,000 teachers across the UK, Hong Kong, and Cyprus, NATRE has cultivated a vibrant professional community that shares expertise, resources, and mutual support.

## Core Mission and Strategic Priorities

### Representing the RE Teaching Community

NATRE's fundamental purpose centres on providing a focal point for the concerns of RE professionals and serving as a representative voice at national level for all who teach and lead in RE. This advocacy function manifests through regular engagement with government bodies, responding to Department for Education (DfE) consultations, contributing to Ofsted policy discussions, and working with Local Authorities and Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education (SACREs).

The association has played significant roles in major policy developments, including responses to the reform of GCSEs and GCEs (2014), the revision of the National Curriculum (2013), and campaigns regarding cuts to bursaries for secondary Initial Teacher Training (2014). NATRE's evidence-based submissions to these consultations draw upon the collective experience of its membership, ensuring that policy makers understand the practical implications of their decisions for classrooms across England.

### Professional Development and Career Support

A central pillar of NATRE's work involves supporting educators at every stage of their career journey. The association recognises that high-quality RE teaching requires both subject knowledge and pedagogical expertise, and it structures its professional development offerings accordingly. From provision for trainee teachers navigating their first encounters with RE pedagogy, through to leadership development for experienced subject coordinators, NATRE's CPD framework addresses the diverse needs of the RE teaching community.

The association's commitment to professional development extends beyond individual teachers to whole-school impact. Through resources designed for subject leaders to cascade training to colleagues, NATRE seeks to elevate the quality of RE provision across entire institutions rather than supporting isolated pockets of excellence.

## Membership Structure and Benefits

### Tiered Membership Packages

NATRE offers a range of membership packages designed to meet the varying needs of individual teachers, schools, and educational institutions. The tiered structure ensures accessibility whilst providing enhanced benefits for those requiring comprehensive support.

**Individual Teacher Membership** provides access to the termly REtoday magazine, curriculum publications, the NATRE membership area of the website, the RE Today subscriber area, and support through NATRE-affiliated local groups. This tier suits classroom teachers seeking to develop their subject knowledge and pedagogical practice.

**Primary School Enhanced Membership** represents NATRE's most comprehensive offering for primary institutions, providing subsidised access to the RE Today Primary RE Curriculum—a complete scheme of work with classroom-ready lesson plans. This membership tier also includes the full range of individual benefits extended to all teachers within the member school.

**Secondary School Enhanced Membership** offers equivalent comprehensive support for secondary institutions, with resources tailored to the demands of Key Stage 3, GCSE, and A-Level provision. The enhanced membership model recognises that effective RE requires coordinated departmental development rather than individual teacher effort alone.

### Member Benefits and Resources

NATRE membership delivers tangible value through multiple channels. Members receive termly copies of REtoday magazine, which includes Professional REflection—a dedicated curriculum publication offering practical guidance on implementing effective RE. The magazine format allows for timely exploration of emerging issues, curriculum developments, and pedagogical innovations.

The association provides month-by-month benefits including exclusive offers and discounts on resources, free monthly downloadable resources written by RE advisers and delivered directly to members' email inboxes, and substantial discounts on all NATRE and RE Today courses. These discounts range from £30 reductions to entirely free course places for members, making high-quality professional development financially accessible.

Members also gain access to exclusive webinars, termly headteacher briefings, and the collective wisdom of over 280 local groups. The NATRE website hosts a comprehensive resource library organised by key stage, topic, and publication type, enabling efficient location of relevant teaching materials.

## RE Today: Publications and Curriculum Resources

### REtoday Magazine

REtoday serves as NATRE's flagship publication, distributed termly to members. The magazine combines scholarly rigour with practical classroom application, featuring contributions from leading RE thinkers alongside practising teachers sharing their innovative approaches. Each issue includes Professional REflection—a dedicated section exploring curriculum development, pedagogical theory, and subject knowledge enhancement.

The magazine's editorial approach balances immediate practical utility with longer-term professional development. Articles range from ready-to-use classroom activities and resources to reflective pieces on the purposes and values underlying religious education. This dual focus recognises that effective RE teaching requires both technical competence and philosophical clarity about the subject's aims.

### Curriculum Book Series

RE Today Services publishes an extensive range of curriculum books supporting RE implementation across all key stages. These publications exemplify NATRE's commitment to high-quality, research-informed resources that address both the substantive content and disciplinary approaches to religious education.

The **Inspiring RE** series comprises nine primary curriculum books planned by practising subject leaders. Designed for both classroom teachers and subject leaders, these resources help improve RE teaching at classroom level whilst supporting whole-school curriculum development. Each book focuses on specific themes or religions, offering detailed guidance on planning, teaching strategies, and assessment approaches.

For secondary settings, RE Today publishes curriculum books introducing multidisciplinary approaches to RE. These resources explore topics from the perspectives of different disciplinary lenses—such as theology, philosophy, and social sciences—helping pupils understand how varying frameworks approach the same content. This disciplinary literacy focus aligns with recent developments in RE pedagogy emphasising the distinctive ways of knowing that characterise the subject.

### Specialised Resource Collections

Beyond the core curriculum series, RE Today produces specialised resources addressing specific pedagogical challenges and emerging curriculum areas. These include the "100 Ideas for Teaching RE" series offering practical strategies for busy teachers, resources supporting the teaching of non-religious worldviews, and materials addressing controversial or sensitive topics.

The **Understanding Christianity** resource, developed in partnership with the Church of England, exemplifies NATRE's collaborative approach to resource development. This substantial programme provides a comprehensive framework for teaching Christianity across the primary phase, combining theological depth with pedagogical accessibility.

## The Spirited Arts Competition

### Overview and Purpose

The Spirited Arts competition represents one of NATRE's most distinctive and celebrated initiatives, engaging thousands of pupils annually in creative exploration of religious and spiritual themes. Running for over two decades, the competition invites pupils from across all key stages to respond to an annual theme through art, poetry, prose, or other creative media.

The competition's design reflects NATRE's understanding that RE encompasses more than cognitive learning about religions. By providing space for creative and affective responses, Spirited Arts enables pupils to engage with existential questions, spiritual experiences, and values reflection in ways that complement analytical classroom learning.

### Annual Themes and Educational Focus

Each year, NATRE announces a theme designed to stimulate thoughtful engagement with religious, philosophical, and ethical questions. Recent themes have included explorations of human-animal relations, ethical veganism as a worldview, and investigations of spiritual expression through creativity. The 2025 theme focused on "Animals", enabling children and young people to explore human-animal relations and think deeply about the moral and spiritual aspects of all living beings.

These themes connect to curriculum content whilst allowing scope for personal interpretation and expression. Teachers can integrate competition entries into existing RE programmes, use the themes as focal points for specific units, or offer participation as an enrichment activity. The flexibility of approach has contributed to Spirited Arts' enduring popularity across diverse school contexts.

### Competition Structure and Recognition

Schools can organise competition participation in various ways, from whole-class entries to school-wide competitions selecting submissions for national entry. NATRE and RE Today provide free resources supporting engagement with each theme, including guidance documents, classroom activities, and exemplar materials from previous years.

Winning entries receive recognition through publication, exhibition, and prizes typically including vouchers for RE Today or NATRE resources. The annual winners' announcement generates significant interest within the RE community, showcasing the remarkable creativity and thoughtfulness that pupils bring to spiritual and religious exploration.

### Partnership with Veganism in Education

Recent Spirited Arts competitions have featured partnerships with external organisations to enrich theme exploration. The collaboration with Veganism in Education (VinE) for the 2024 theme on ethical veganism exemplifies this approach, providing teachers with additional expertise and resources whilst introducing pupils to contemporary ethical movements. Such partnerships expand the range of voices and perspectives available to participating schools.

## Professional Development Programme

### Strictly RE: The National Conference

Strictly RE stands as the UK's largest annual gathering of religious education professionals, attracting hundreds of teachers, leaders, researchers, and policy makers for a day of intensive professional development. Hosted by NATRE each January, the conference has become an essential fixture in the RE calendar, offering unparalleled opportunities for networking, learning, and inspiration.

The 2026 conference, held at the Voco St. John's Hotel in Solihull on Saturday 31 January, exemplified the event's comprehensive approach. With the themes "Authenticity—Real voices, real RE", "Belonging—Together in RE", and "Challenge—Aim higher, reach further", the conference addressed contemporary priorities whilst maintaining focus on practical classroom improvement.

The programme structure combines plenary sessions from inspirational speakers with a diverse range of seminars organised by key stage and specialism. The 2026 offering included eighteen seminars across three sessions, covering topics such as disciplinary approaches to RE, sacred spaces and architecture, SEND strategies, climate crisis engagement, primary subject leadership, teaching Christianity authentically, A-Level Religious Studies, oracy development, and AI integration in RE teaching.

### Regional and Online CPD

Beyond the national conference, NATRE provides professional development through regional events, online webinars, and self-paced resources. This distributed approach recognises that not all teachers can access national events, whilst also enabling more frequent and responsive CPD provision.

The association offers extended courses spanning multiple sessions, such as the three-part programme on developing subject knowledge in Christianity held across November 2025, January 2026, and May 2026. These sustained programmes allow for deeper exploration than single-session events permit, supporting genuine professional development rather than superficial awareness-raising.

### Subject Leadership Support

NATRE pays particular attention to the distinctive needs of RE subject leaders, who often work in isolated contexts without departmental colleagues. Dedicated resources for primary and secondary subject leaders include guidance on disseminating training to other staff, strategies for supporting beginner teachers in RE, and approaches to curriculum development and monitoring.

The subject leadership focus recognises that improving RE at scale requires investment in those responsible for coordinating provision. By equipping subject leaders with knowledge, skills, and confidence, NATRE seeks to create multiplicative effects throughout the education system.

## Local Groups and Regional Networks

### Network Structure and Purpose

NATRE's network of over 280 affiliated local groups forms the grassroots foundation of the association's work. These groups connect more than 2,000 teachers and RE professionals, providing regular opportunities for face-to-face networking, resource sharing, and collaborative problem-solving. NATRE's stated aim is that every teacher of RE should have access to a NATRE-affiliated local group within 10 miles (or 30 minutes) of where they live or teach.

Local groups typically meet termly, with agendas responsive to member needs and current developments in RE. Meetings might feature input from visiting speakers, examination of new resources, discussion of syllabus changes, or simply collegial conversation amongst professionals facing similar challenges. The informal, teacher-led character of these groups complements the more formal professional development offered through NATRE's national programmes.

### Support for Group Development

NATRE actively supports the establishment and maintenance of local groups through dedicated administrative support, resource provision, and liaison through the Local Groups Officer. Teachers interested in forming new groups can access guidance materials and direct support from NATRE, with the association welcoming expansion into new geographical areas or specialist interest groups.

The local group network extends beyond England to include affiliated groups in Hong Kong and Cyprus, supporting teachers in British international schools. These international connections demonstrate NATRE's commitment to RE professionals regardless of their specific location, provided they share the association's values and objectives.

### Virtual Networking

Recognising the challenges of geographical distribution and time constraints, NATRE has developed online networking opportunities alongside face-to-face local groups. Virtual events, social media communities, and forum discussions enable teachers to connect with colleagues beyond their immediate locality. These digital channels proved particularly valuable during periods of restricted face-to-face contact, and remain important components of NATRE's networking provision.

## Advocacy and Lobbying Activity

### Government Engagement

NATRE maintains active engagement with government bodies and policy processes affecting religious education. The association regularly responds to Department for Education consultations, providing evidence-based submissions that represent the collective perspective of the RE teaching community. Recent consultation responses have addressed curriculum reform, assessment arrangements, teacher training, and school accountability measures.

The association's engagement strategy combines formal consultation responses with ongoing relationships with officials, ministers, and parliamentarians. NATRE representatives participate in stakeholder groups, advisory panels, and working parties, ensuring that RE perspectives inform policy development from inception rather than being considered as afterthoughts.

### The Teacher Advocacy Toolkit

Recognising that national-level advocacy must be complemented by local action, NATRE has developed a Teacher Advocacy Toolkit providing practitioners with the resources to defend and promote RE within their own schools. The toolkit offers legal backing for RE's place on the curriculum, key arguments for the subject's value, and practical strategies for engaging with senior leaders and governors.

This distributed advocacy approach acknowledges that curriculum decisions are increasingly made at school level, particularly in academy settings. By equipping individual teachers to make the case for RE, NATRE seeks to protect provision across thousands of individual institutions.

### Collaboration with the RE Council

NATRE works closely with the Religious Education Council of England and Wales (REC), the umbrella body coordinating RE organisations. This collaboration enables coordinated advocacy that presents a unified voice to government and other stakeholders. NATRE's Executive Committee includes representatives with specific responsibilities for REC liaison, ensuring systematic coordination between the organisations.

The partnership has been particularly evident in responses to the Ofsted "Deep and meaningful?" subject report (April 2024), where NATRE joined with the REC and other partners in calling for clear national expectations for RE, support for teacher recruitment, and investment in professional development infrastructure.

## Research and Curriculum Development

### Contribution to the National Review of RE

NATRE played a significant role in the National Review of RE and the development of the non-statutory National Curriculum Framework for RE. Executive members participated in steering groups and consultation events, ensuring that practising teachers' perspectives informed the review's recommendations. The association continues to support implementation of the Framework, providing resources and guidance that help schools translate its principles into practice.

### Farmington Fellowship Programme

NATRE supports the Farmington Institute's work in RE research and scholarship, recognising the importance of evidence-informed practice in the subject. The Farmington Fellowship Programme provides opportunities for teachers to engage with research, develop their own inquiries, and contribute to the knowledge base underlying effective RE. NATRE's promotion of Farmington opportunities reflects its commitment to developing research literacy within the RE teaching community.

### CSTG Scholarship Programmes

The association supports and promotes the Community of Saint Thomas the Gospel (CSTG) Scholarship Programmes, which offer funded opportunities for leadership development, Master's study, and doctoral research in religious education. These programmes address the need for advanced professional development beyond initial teacher training, cultivating the next generation of RE leaders and scholars.

## Conclusion: NATRE's Continuing Mission

NATRE has established itself as an indispensable organisation for religious education in England, combining practical classroom support with strategic policy influence. Through its publications, professional development programmes, competitions, and advocacy work, the association touches the professional lives of thousands of teachers and, through them, the learning experiences of millions of pupils.

The challenges facing RE—including recruitment difficulties, curriculum time pressures, and public misunderstanding of the subject's purposes—make NATRE's work more important than ever. The association's teacher-led character, democratic governance, and comprehensive service offering position it uniquely to address these challenges whilst maintaining fidelity to the subject's educational and civic purposes.

For teachers of religious education at any career stage, NATRE membership represents an investment in professional growth, community connection, and subject advocacy. The association's ongoing evolution—embracing digital opportunities, developing new partnerships, and responding to policy changes—ensures that it remains relevant and effective in supporting RE teaching for years to come.
