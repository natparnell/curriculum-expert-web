# Personal Knowledge and Pupil Reflection in Religious Education

## Introduction: Navigating the Personal and Academic

Religious Education (RE) in English schools occupies a unique and sometimes contested space. Unlike other curriculum subjects, RE directly engages with questions of meaning, purpose, identity, and value—areas that are deeply personal for many pupils and their families. This creates a fundamental pedagogical challenge: how do we distinguish between academic knowledge about religions and worldviews on the one hand, and pupils' personal beliefs, spiritual development, and worldview formation on the other?

The distinction matters profoundly. Academic knowledge in RE involves understanding the beliefs, practices, and lived experiences of religious and non-religious communities. Personal knowledge encompasses pupils' own emerging worldviews, their sense of identity, and their spiritual development. When teachers conflate these domains, they risk either reducing RE to mere information transmission (ignoring its transformative potential) or inappropriately imposing beliefs (violating the ethical boundaries of education in a pluralist democracy).

This knowledge file explores how teachers can maintain appropriate distinctions between personal and academic knowledge while creating space for genuine pupil reflection. It draws on the 2018 Commission on Religious Education's "Religion and Worldviews" paradigm, recent Ofsted guidance, and established best practice from NATRE (National Association of Teachers of Religious Education) and RE Today.

## Understanding the Distinction: Academic vs Personal Knowledge

### Academic Knowledge in RE

Academic knowledge in Religious Education comprises what pupils can know, understand, and do in relation to religions and worldviews. This includes:

**Substantive knowledge**: Accurate information about religious traditions, including beliefs, teachings, practices, texts, and histories. Pupils learn what Muslims believe about the Prophet Muhammad, how Christians celebrate Holy Week, or what philosophical arguments exist for and against the existence of God.

**Procedural knowledge**: Understanding how knowledge about religion is constructed, evaluated, and contested. This includes knowing how to interpret religious texts, understanding the methods of theology, philosophy, and the social sciences, and recognising how different disciplinary lenses reveal different aspects of religious phenomena.

**Disciplinary knowledge**: Awareness of the distinct ways in which religion is studied—whether through theology, philosophy, ethics, sociology, anthropology, or psychology. Each discipline brings different questions, methods, and standards of evidence.

Academic knowledge is public, contestable, and subject to revision. It can be assessed against publicly available criteria. A pupil's understanding of Buddhist teachings on suffering can be evaluated based on textual evidence and scholarly interpretation, regardless of the pupil's personal beliefs.

### Personal Knowledge in RE

Personal knowledge encompasses pupils' own beliefs, values, identities, and sense of meaning. This includes:

**Worldview formation**: Pupils' developing answers to ultimate questions about reality, meaning, purpose, and value. A pupil may be forming a secular humanist worldview, an Islamic worldview, or a syncretic worldview drawing on multiple sources.

**Spiritual development**: As defined by Ofsted, this includes exploration of beliefs and experience, respect for faiths and feelings, imagination and creativity, and reflection. Spiritual development is not synonymous with religious development; atheist pupils can experience profound spiritual growth.

**Identity construction**: How pupils understand themselves in relation to religious and cultural traditions. For pupils from religious families, this may involve negotiating inherited beliefs. For all pupils, it involves developing a sense of their own values and commitments.

**Moral formation**: The development of ethical reasoning and moral character. RE contributes to pupils' capacity to reason about right and wrong, justice and injustice, and to form their own moral commitments.

Personal knowledge is, by definition, personal. It cannot be assessed in the same way as academic knowledge. While we can evaluate the coherence of a pupil's ethical reasoning or their understanding of religious teachings, we cannot legitimately assess whether their worldview is "correct" or their spiritual development "adequate."

## The 2018 Commission on Religious Education: The Worldviews Turn

### The Religion and Worldviews Paradigm

The 2018 Commission on Religious Education, chaired by the Reverend Professor John Clarke and Professor Linda Woodhead, proposed a significant reframing of the subject. The Commission recommended that RE be renamed "Religion and Worldviews" to reflect the reality of religious and non-religious diversity in contemporary Britain.

Central to this proposal was the concept of "worldviews":

> "A worldview is a person's way of understanding, experiencing and responding to the world. It can be described as a philosophy of life or an approach to life. This includes how a person understands the nature of reality and their own place in the world, and how they respond to this understanding."

The Commission distinguished between:

- **Organised worldviews**: Established religious and non-religious traditions (Christianity, Islam, Humanism, etc.)
- **Personal worldviews**: Individuals' own ways of understanding and living in the world

This framework is particularly helpful for distinguishing academic and personal knowledge. Pupils study organised worldviews academically—learning about their beliefs, practices, and diversity. Simultaneously, they are supported in reflecting on and developing their own personal worldviews.

### Implications for Personal Knowledge

The worldviews paradigm has several implications for how we handle personal knowledge:

**Democratisation**: By acknowledging that everyone has a worldview (not just religious people), the framework validates pupils' own perspectives while maintaining academic rigour in studying organised traditions.

**Inclusivity**: The framework explicitly includes non-religious worldviews (humanism, secularism, atheism) alongside religious traditions, recognising the reality of pluralism in modern Britain.

**Developmental appropriateness**: Pupils' personal worldviews are understood as developing and evolving, not fixed. RE supports this development through exposure to diverse perspectives and reflective practice.

**Critical thinking**: The framework emphasises that studying worldviews involves critical engagement—evaluating arguments, examining evidence, and forming reasoned judgements.

## Ofsted and Personal Development

### The Education Inspection Framework

Ofsted's Education Inspection Framework (EIF, updated 2023) places significant emphasis on personal development, including spiritual, moral, social, and cultural (SMSC) development. RE has a distinctive contribution to make in all these areas.

Ofsted inspectors evaluate whether schools:

- Provide rich experiences that promote spiritual, moral, social, and cultural development
- Prepare pupils for life in modern Britain, including understanding of fundamental British values
- Support pupils to develop their character, including resilience, confidence, and independence
- Promote equality of opportunity and understanding of diversity

RE contributes to these outcomes through academic study that simultaneously supports personal development. However, inspectors are clear that personal development should not replace academic learning; rather, they should be mutually reinforcing.

### Distinguishing Personal Development from Indoctrination

Ofsted's guidance implicitly supports the distinction between appropriate personal development and inappropriate indoctrination:

**Appropriate practice** includes:
- Creating space for pupils to reflect on their own beliefs and values
- Exposing pupils to diverse perspectives and respectful dialogue
- Teaching pupils to form and justify their own views using evidence and reasoning
- Supporting character development through engagement with ethical questions

**Inappropriate practice** includes:
- Promoting particular religious or non-religious beliefs as true
- Creating pressure for pupils to adopt particular views
- Using RE as a vehicle for evangelism or conversion
- Assuming that pupils from particular backgrounds hold particular beliefs

The distinction lies in whether the teacher is supporting pupils' own reflective processes or seeking to impose particular outcomes.

## Pedagogical Approaches: Handling Pupils' Worldviews Appropriately

### The Reflective Classroom

Creating appropriate space for personal reflection requires deliberate pedagogical choices:

**Structured reflection**: Rather than open-ended sharing (which can pressure pupils to disclose personal beliefs), use structured frameworks. The "Diamond 9" ranking activity, for example, asks pupils to prioritise values or principles, revealing worldview commitments through choices rather than direct disclosure.

**Philosophical enquiry**: Approaches like Philosophy for Children (P4C) create spaces where pupils can explore existential and ethical questions without the teacher imposing answers. The teacher's role is to facilitate dialogue, not to direct conclusions.

**Expressive arts**: Creative activities—art, poetry, drama, music—allow pupils to explore beliefs and values obliquely. The Spirited Arts competition, run by NATRE, demonstrates how creative work can enable profound spiritual expression without requiring direct doctrinal statement.

**Journaling**: Private reflection journals allow pupils to process their thinking without public exposure. Teachers can guide reflection through prompts while respecting privacy.

### The Role of the Teacher

RE teachers occupy a complex position. They are subject experts with academic knowledge about religions and worldviews. They are also educators responsible for supporting pupils' personal development. And they are individuals with their own worldviews (whether religious or not).

Best practice involves:

**Professional distance**: Teachers maintain appropriate boundaries, avoiding disclosure of personal beliefs in ways that could influence pupils. This does not mean total silence about one's perspective—sometimes sharing can be appropriate—but careful consideration of pedagogical purpose.

**Neutral facilitation**: When discussing controversial questions, teachers facilitate balanced exploration of multiple perspectives without signalling which view is "correct."

**Inclusive language**: Using language that includes all pupils, regardless of their backgrounds. For example, saying "some people believe..." rather than "we believe..."

**Challenge and support**: Teachers challenge pupils to think deeply and critically while supporting their right to hold and express their own views.

### Dealing with Pupil Disclosure

When pupils voluntarily disclose their beliefs or experiences, teachers must respond appropriately:

**Validation**: Acknowledge the pupil's contribution without necessarily endorsing their view. "Thank you for sharing that perspective" is different from "That's right."

**Connection**: Link personal contributions back to academic content. "You mentioned prayer—how does that connect to what we've learned about Muslim prayer practices?"

**Protection**: Be alert to situations where a pupil's disclosure might expose them to ridicule or pressure. Protect vulnerable pupils while maintaining an open classroom climate.

**Confidentiality**: Respect the privacy of what pupils share. Do not discuss individual pupils' beliefs with other staff or parents without good reason.

### Addressing Controversial Issues

RE inevitably engages with controversial topics—gender and sexuality, abortion, euthanasia, terrorism, creation and science. Handling these requires particular care:

**Preparation**: Teachers should anticipate controversy and plan how to handle it. What are the different perspectives? What misconceptions might arise?

**Ground rules**: Establish and maintain classroom norms for respectful discussion. Disagreement is welcome; disrespect is not.

**Balanced representation**: Ensure that multiple perspectives are fairly represented, including those that may be unpopular or minority positions.

**Distinction of types of claim**: Help pupils distinguish between factual claims ("The Bible says..."), interpretive claims ("Christians interpret this to mean..."), and evaluative claims ("This is right/wrong because...").

**Safe uncertainty**: Create a classroom culture where it is acceptable not to have firm views, to be uncertain, or to change one's mind.

## Assessment and the Personal/Academic Boundary

### Assessing Academic Knowledge

Academic knowledge in RE can and should be assessed using conventional methods:

- Written essays demonstrating knowledge and understanding
- Examinations testing recall and application
- Extended projects requiring research and synthesis
- Oral presentations on religious or philosophical topics

These assessments should focus on what pupils know and can do, not on what they believe.

### Assessing Personal Development

Personal development should not be formally assessed in the same way. Schools may evaluate:

- Participation in reflection activities
- Quality of engagement with diverse perspectives
- Development of reasoning and dialogue skills
- Creative expression of beliefs and values

But they should not assess the content of pupils' beliefs or the adequacy of their spiritual development.

### Feedback and Progression

Feedback in RE should be primarily about academic progress:

- Knowledge: "You've accurately described the Five Pillars of Islam."
- Understanding: "Your explanation of why Hajj is significant shows good grasp of Islamic theology."
- Skills: "Your argument is well-structured, with clear premises leading to a conclusion."

Where feedback addresses personal reflection, it should focus on the quality of thinking rather than the content of belief:

- "You've considered multiple perspectives before forming your view—that shows intellectual maturity."
- "Your reasoning draws on evidence from the text effectively."

## Curriculum Design Considerations

### Balancing Depth and Breadth

A well-designed RE curriculum provides:

**Depth of study**: Sufficient exploration of particular traditions to develop genuine understanding and avoid superficial stereotyping.

**Breadth of encounter**: Exposure to diverse religious and non-religious worldviews, including those not represented in the local community.

**Systematic progression**: Building knowledge and skills progressively from EYFS through to Key Stage 5.

**Space for reflection**: Built-in opportunities for pupils to process learning personally and reflect on their own responses.

### The Locally Agreed Syllabus Context

In community schools without a religious character, RE follows the Locally Agreed Syllabus developed by the local SACRE (Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education). These syllabuses vary considerably in their approach to personal knowledge:

Some syllabuses explicitly embrace the worldviews approach and include substantial focus on pupils' own perspectives. Others maintain a more traditional focus on learning about religions, with less explicit attention to personal reflection.

Teachers should know their local syllabus and understand its expectations regarding personal knowledge and reflection.

### Faith Schools and Distinctive Contexts

Faith schools operate within different parameters. While they must still teach about other religions, they may legitimately prioritise the tradition of the school's foundation and may have explicit aims regarding pupils' spiritual formation within that tradition.

Even in faith schools, however, the distinction between academic and personal knowledge remains important. Teaching about the school's faith should still involve genuine education—critical engagement, exploration of diversity, and development of understanding—rather than mere catechesis.

## Common Misconceptions and Challenges

### Misconception 1: "RE is about making pupils religious"

This misconception persists among some parents, governors, and even teachers. Clarity about the academic purpose of RE—learning about religions and worldviews—is essential. While RE may contribute to pupils' spiritual development, its primary aim is educational, not evangelistic.

### Misconception 2: "Teachers must be neutral"

Neutrality is neither possible nor desirable. Teachers inevitably bring their own perspectives to the classroom. What matters is professional practice—maintaining appropriate boundaries, facilitating balanced exploration, and supporting pupils' own reflective processes.

### Misconception 3: "Pupils should never share their beliefs"

Overcorrection can lead to sterile classrooms where pupils feel their perspectives are unwelcome. The goal is not to suppress personal expression but to create conditions where it can occur appropriately—voluntarily, respectfully, and without pressure.

### Misconception 4: "Personal knowledge doesn't belong in RE"

Some advocates of a purely "objective" approach to RE argue that personal knowledge has no place in the subject. This ignores the reality that learning about worldviews inevitably prompts reflection on one's own perspective. Ignoring the personal dimension impoverishes the subject and denies pupils opportunities for meaningful spiritual development.

## Practical Strategies for the Classroom

### Primary Phase

**Worldview windows**: Use the metaphor of windows, mirrors, and doors—RE offers windows into other worlds, mirrors reflecting our own experience, and doors to new ways of thinking.

**Big Questions**: Structure units around existential questions ("Why are we here?" "What happens when we die?") that invite reflection while studying diverse responses.

**Story and symbol**: Use religious stories and symbols as starting points for both learning about traditions and reflecting on meaning.

### Secondary Phase

**Philosophical debate**: Formal debate structures enable rigorous exploration of controversial questions while maintaining respectful boundaries.

**Ethical dilemma scenarios**: Case studies require pupils to apply ethical reasoning to complex situations, developing their own moral reasoning while learning about diverse ethical frameworks.

**Theological literacy**: Teach pupils to read religious texts with understanding of genre, context, and interpretive tradition—skills that enable independent engagement.

### Cross-Phase Strategies

**Community engagement**: Visits to places of worship and encounters with believers provide authentic learning that supports both academic understanding and personal reflection.

**Oracy development**: Structured discussion protocols teach pupils to articulate their views, listen to others, and respond respectfully.

**Interdisciplinary connections**: Links with English literature, history, art, and PSHE enrich RE and provide multiple entry points for different learners.

## Conclusion: The Art of Distinction

Distinguishing personal knowledge from academic knowledge in RE is not always straightforward. The boundary is porous; learning about worldviews inevitably affects one's own worldview, and teachers cannot control all the variables in a classroom.

What matters is intention and practice. Teachers who are clear about the distinction, who design curriculum and pedagogy to respect it, and who maintain appropriate professional boundaries enable pupils to:

- Develop rich, accurate knowledge about religious and non-religious worldviews
- Think critically and independently about questions of meaning and value
- Form and express their own views while respecting the views of others
- Grow spiritually, morally, and personally through engagement with the subject

The goal is not to produce pupils with particular beliefs but to produce educated young people who understand the religious and worldview landscape of modern Britain, who can engage respectfully with diversity, and who have developed the capacity to form and live by their own values.

In a diverse and sometimes divided society, this educational vision—academic rigour combined with personal reflection, knowledge combined with understanding, understanding combined with respect—has never been more important.
