# Core and Non-Examined Religious Education

## Overview

Core Religious Education (often called "non-examined RE" or simply "Core RE") refers to the statutory provision of religious education for pupils who are not pursuing a formal qualification in the subject. In England, all maintained schools—including academies and free schools—are required by law to provide RE for all registered pupils, including those in the sixth form, regardless of whether they have opted to take GCSE or A-Level Religious Studies.

This statutory requirement creates a distinct pedagogical and curricular challenge: how to deliver meaningful, high-quality religious education to pupils who have not chosen to study it formally, often in the critical post-16 phase when many pupils have disengaged from the subject or perceive it as having limited relevance to their futures.

The "GCSE-only trap" describes a phenomenon where schools focus their curricular and pedagogical energy exclusively on examination classes, leaving non-examined RE as an afterthought—often delegated to non-specialists, delivered through occasional drop-down days, or reduced to tokenistic provision that fails to meet statutory obligations or educational standards.

## Statutory Requirements for Core RE

### The Legal Framework

The statutory basis for Core RE rests on several interconnected pieces of legislation and guidance:

**Education Act 1996 (Section 80)**

All pupils in community, foundation, and voluntary schools (including academies and free schools through their funding agreements) must receive religious education. This requirement applies:
- To all registered pupils, including those aged 16–19
- Throughout the full school year, not merely during term time
- Whether or not the pupil is following an examination course in Religious Studies

**School Standards and Framework Act 1998**

This Act reinforced the requirement for RE and established the right of parents to withdraw their children from religious education. It also clarified the position of sixth form students, who may withdraw themselves from RE provision with parental agreement.

**Academies Act 2010 and Funding Agreements**

Academies and free schools are required through their funding agreements to provide RE in accordance with the locally agreed syllabus (for community and foundation schools without a religious character) or in accordance with their trust deed (for schools with a religious character).

### The Locally Agreed Syllabus

For maintained schools without a religious character, RE must be provided in accordance with the locally agreed syllabus adopted by the Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education (SACRE) for the relevant local authority area.

Key features of agreed syllabuses relevant to Core RE:

- **Breadth of study**: Most modern agreed syllabuses require the study of Christianity alongside other principal religions represented in Great Britain, and may include non-religious worldviews such as Humanism
- **Programmes of study**: Agreed syllabuses typically specify content and learning outcomes across key stages, including expectations for post-16 provision
- **Time allocation**: While there is no statutory minimum time requirement for RE, most SACREs recommend appropriate time allocations that should be honoured for both examined and non-examined routes
- **Assessment and reporting**: Schools must report on pupils' progress in RE, even where no formal qualification is being taken

### Post-16 Statutory Requirements

The requirement for RE provision in the sixth form is often overlooked but remains statutory:

**For 16–19 Year Olds**

- All registered sixth form pupils must receive RE unless withdrawn by their parents (or, in some circumstances, by the pupil themselves with parental agreement)
- The Education Act 1996, Section 80(1)(b), explicitly extends the RE requirement to "every pupil registered at the school who is not a sixth-form pupil"—but this does not exempt sixth formers entirely. Rather, it establishes separate arrangements whereby sixth form provision is determined by the school's governing body in consultation with the local SACRE
- For pupils in sixth form colleges and further education institutions, there is no statutory requirement for RE, though many institutions choose to offer it

**Determining Post-16 RE**

The precise nature of post-16 RE is determined through consultation between the school governing body and the local SACRE. This "determination" should specify:
- The aims and objectives of the RE programme
- The time to be allocated
- The content and approach
- How the provision will be organised and delivered

## The "GCSE-Only Trap": Causes and Consequences

### Understanding the Trap

The "GCSE-only trap" occurs when schools concentrate their resources, expertise, and curriculum development almost exclusively on examined RE, leaving Core RE as a marginal activity. This phenomenon arises from several interconnected pressures:

**Accountability Metrics**

- Progress 8 and Attainment 8 measures focus on examination outcomes, creating powerful incentives for schools to prioritise qualification-bearing subjects
- Ofsted inspection frameworks, while explicitly acknowledging the importance of the curriculum, still give significant weight to examination results
- Published performance tables emphasise GCSE and A-Level grades, with little visibility for non-examined provision

**Resource Constraints**

- Timetabling constraints in Key Stage 4 often lead to "carousel" arrangements where non-examination subjects compete for limited curriculum time
- Post-16, the shift to three A-Level equivalents and the decline of general studies or enrichment programmes has squeezed space for Core RE
- Financial pressures lead schools to reduce staffing in subjects where there is no examination cohort

**Teacher Deployment**

- Schools frequently assign Core RE to non-specialist teachers or teaching assistants, particularly at Key Stage 4 and in the sixth form
- Where RE specialists are deployed, they are often focused on examination classes, with Core RE becoming a residual allocation
- The absence of specialist expertise undermines the quality and confidence of Core RE delivery

**Perception and Status**

- Pupils—and sometimes parents and staff—perceive non-examined RE as "not real RE" or as lacking value compared to qualification-bearing alternatives
- The absence of external validation (examination grades, league table presence) can contribute to low status for Core RE within the school's curriculum hierarchy
- Where Core RE is delivered through occasional drop-down days or collapsed timetable events, it may be perceived as an interruption rather than as coherent curriculum provision

### Consequences of Poor Core RE Provision

When schools fall into the GCSE-only trap, the consequences can be significant:

**For Pupils**

- Loss of opportunity to continue developing religious literacy beyond Key Stage 3
- Narrowing of the curriculum experience, particularly for pupils who do not take RS at examination level
- Potential disengagement from questions of meaning, value, and belief at a crucial developmental stage
- For post-16 pupils, missing the opportunity to explore ethical, philosophical, and spiritual questions relevant to adult life and citizenship

**For Schools**

- Risk of non-compliance with statutory requirements, potentially affecting inspection outcomes
- Ofsted has identified weak Core RE provision as an area of concern in a significant number of schools
- Loss of curricular coherence where RE is fragmented or tokenistic
- Missed opportunity to contribute to pupils' spiritual, moral, social, and cultural development (SMSC)

**For Society**

- Reduced religious literacy among the general population
- Diminished capacity for informed dialogue about religious and ethical issues
- Potential reinforcement of stereotypes and misconceptions where RE is not taught with appropriate expertise

## Principles of High-Quality Core RE

### Curriculum Design for Core RE

Effective Core RE programmes share certain characteristics that distinguish them from tokenistic provision:

**Clear Aims and Purpose**

High-quality Core RE is designed with explicit aims that go beyond "covering" statutory requirements. These aims typically include:
- Developing religious literacy and understanding of diverse worldviews
- Supporting pupils' spiritual, moral, social, and cultural development
- Preparing pupils for life in a pluralistic society
- Enabling informed dialogue about controversial issues
- Supporting personal reflection and ethical reasoning

**Coherence and Progression**

Core RE should not be a random series of disconnected topics but a coherent programme with:
- Clear progression from Key Stage 3 into Key Stage 4 and beyond
- Logical sequencing of content that builds knowledge and understanding over time
- Explicit links to other curriculum areas (citizenship, PSHE, English, history) where appropriate
- Attention to the development of skills as well as content knowledge

**Relevance and Engagement**

Particularly at Key Stage 4 and post-16, Core RE must address the interests and concerns of pupils who have not chosen to study the subject:
- Content that connects to contemporary issues, media, and young people's lived experience
- Opportunities for discussion, debate, and exploration of controversial questions
- Approaches that value pupils' own perspectives while challenging them to engage with different viewpoints
- Use of varied pedagogies that maintain engagement without the extrinsic motivation of examination preparation

**Appropriate Challenge**

Core RE should be intellectually challenging, not "dumbed down" because it is non-examined:
- Engagement with complex theological, philosophical, and ethical questions
- Development of critical thinking and evaluative skills
- Exposure to primary sources and scholarly perspectives
- Opportunities for extended thinking and reflection

### Pedagogical Approaches

The pedagogy of Core RE requires particular attention, given the absence of examination motivation and the diverse composition of Core RE classes:

**Dialogical and Enquiry-Based Approaches**

- Philosophy for Children (P4C) techniques adapted for religious and ethical questions
- Structured classroom dialogue that enables pupils to explore different perspectives
- Open questioning that values pupils' contributions while maintaining academic rigour
- Safe spaces for discussion of controversial and sensitive topics

**Experiential and Immersive Learning**

- Visits to places of worship and encounters with religious practitioners
- Use of case studies, role-play, and simulation to explore religious practice and ethical dilemmas
- Engagement with religious texts, artefacts, and artistic expressions
- Opportunities for reflection and personal meaning-making

**Contemporary and Media-Focused Approaches**

- Analysis of news media, social media, and popular culture representations of religion
- Exploration of current ethical debates (medical ethics, environmental ethics, social justice)
- Engagement with film, music, and literature that raises religious and philosophical questions
- Critical analysis of online information about religious traditions

**Project-Based and Student-Led Learning**

- Extended enquiries that allow pupils to pursue particular interests within broad frameworks
- Collaborative projects that develop research and presentation skills
- Opportunities for pupils to lead aspects of learning, including peer teaching
- Connections to citizenship and community engagement

### Content Selection

While specific content will be determined by the locally agreed syllabus, high-quality Core RE typically includes:

**Religious Diversity**

- Substantive engagement with Christianity and other principal religions represented in Britain
- Attention to lived religion, not merely doctrinal summaries
- Recognition of internal diversity within religious traditions
- Inclusion of non-religious worldviews where required by the agreed syllabus

**Contemporary Issues**

- Ethical questions relevant to young people's lives (relationships, family, sexuality, medical ethics)
- Social and political issues approached from religious and ethical perspectives (poverty, climate change, conflict)
- Questions of identity, belonging, and community in pluralistic societies
- Media, technology, and digital ethics

**Philosophical and Existential Questions**

- Questions of meaning, purpose, and value
- The relationship between science and religion
- Arguments for and against the existence of God
- Questions of suffering, evil, and hope

## Core RE in the Sixth Form

### The Distinctive Challenge of Post-16 Core RE

Post-16 Core RE presents particular challenges and opportunities:

**Voluntary Participation**

Unlike Key Stage 4, where Core RE is compulsory (subject to parental right of withdrawal), sixth form students may—with parental agreement—withdraw themselves from RE provision. This creates a context where Core RE must be genuinely attractive and valuable to young adults.

**Maturity and Experience**

Sixth form students bring:
- Greater maturity and capacity for abstract and critical thinking
- Life experience that informs engagement with ethical and existential questions
- Developing identity and worldviews that may be resistant to external influence
- Clearer sense of future pathways and how educational experiences relate to their goals

**Time Pressures**

Post-16 students face intense demands:
- Three A-Level (or equivalent) subjects with heavy workload expectations
- University applications and preparation for admissions tests and interviews
- Part-time employment or caring responsibilities
- Extracurricular activities intended to support personal statements

These pressures mean Core RE provision must be efficient, focused, and clearly valuable.

### Models of Post-16 Core RE Provision

Schools have developed various models for delivering Core RE in the sixth form:

**Enrichment and Extension Programmes**

- Weekly or fortnightly sessions as part of a broader enrichment programme
- Short courses (half-term or term-length) on specific themes
- Voluntary lecture series or discussion groups
- Integration with general studies or EPQ (Extended Project Qualification) support

**Tutorial and Pastoral Integration**

- RE themes integrated into tutorial programmes or pastoral provision
- Form time activities with religious, ethical, or philosophical focus
- Cross-curricular links to PSHE, citizenship, or careers education

**Standalone Core RE**

- Dedicated RE lessons within the sixth form timetable
- Often structured as short courses with clear time boundaries
- May lead to non-GCSE accreditation (e.g., ASDAN, extended project, or college certification)

**Voluntary and Interest-Based Provision**

- Philosophy or theology clubs and societies
- Debating and discussion groups
- Preparation for theological college entry or religious studies at university (for interested students, even if not taking A-Level RS)

### Content for Post-16 Core RE

Effective post-16 Core RE typically addresses themes of particular relevance to young adults:

**Ethics and Professional Life**

- Professional ethics and workplace dilemmas
- Questions of integrity, honesty, and responsibility
- Ethical dimensions of career choices
- Business ethics and corporate social responsibility

**Relationships, Family, and Identity**

- Ethical questions about relationships, sexuality, and family formation
- Identity in a digital age
- Gender, sexuality, and religious perspectives
- Marriage, partnership, and commitment

**Medical and Environmental Ethics**

- Current debates in medical ethics (genetic manipulation, end-of-life decisions, mental health)
- Environmental ethics and climate responsibility
- Animal rights and human responsibilities
- Ethics of technology and artificial intelligence

**Philosophy of Religion and Atheism**

- Advanced consideration of arguments for and against religious belief
- Examination of atheist, agnostic, and secular humanist perspectives
- Questions of meaning and purpose in secular worldviews
- The relationship between science, religion, and reason

**Political and Social Ethics**

- Religious perspectives on politics, justice, and social change
- Questions of poverty, inequality, and global responsibility
- War, peace, and conflict resolution
- Religious freedom, tolerance, and pluralism

## Assessment and Quality Assurance in Core RE

### Assessing Progress Without Examinations

While Core RE does not lead to formal qualifications, schools remain responsible for assessing and reporting on pupils' progress:

**Formative Assessment Approaches**

- Ongoing teacher assessment through observation of discussion and participation
- Assessment of written work, projects, and presentations
- Pupil self-assessment and reflection
- Peer assessment in collaborative activities

**Summative Reporting**

- End-of-year or end-of-key-stage assessments that capture pupils' achievement
- Reporting to parents that includes RE alongside other subjects
- Tracking of progress over time within the Core RE programme

**Quality Indicators**

- Pupil voice: feedback from pupils about the quality and value of Core RE
- Engagement metrics: attendance, participation, and completion of work in Core RE classes
- Progression: evidence of developing knowledge, understanding, and skills over time

### Monitoring and Evaluation

School leaders and RE subject leaders should:

- Regularly review the Core RE curriculum for coherence, relevance, and challenge
- Observe Core RE teaching and provide feedback to teachers
- Analyse assessment data to identify strengths and areas for development
- Gather pupil voice to inform curriculum development
- Monitor compliance with statutory requirements (time allocation, coverage, withdrawal requests)

### External Accountability

**Ofsted Inspection**

Ofsted inspectors evaluate RE provision, including Core RE:
- The quality of education judgement considers the curriculum, teaching, and achievement in RE for all pupils, not merely those taking examinations
- Personal development judgement considers how RE contributes to pupils' spiritual, moral, social, and cultural development
- Leadership and management judgement considers how leaders ensure statutory requirements are met and quality is maintained

Where Core RE is weak or tokenistic, inspectors may identify this as a area for improvement or as a compliance issue.

**SACRE Monitoring**

Local SACREs have a responsibility to monitor RE provision in their area:
- Some SACREs conduct periodic surveys or reviews of RE in schools
- Schools may be asked to report on their RE provision, including Core RE
- SACREs can provide support and challenge where Core RE provision is weak

## Avoiding the GCSE-Only Trap: Strategic Leadership

### The Role of Senior Leaders

Senior leaders play a crucial role in ensuring Core RE is valued and effective:

**Curriculum Planning**

- Ensure the whole-school curriculum plan makes explicit, appropriate provision for Core RE
- Protect time for Core RE in timetables, avoiding marginalisation
- Allocate appropriate staffing, including specialist expertise where possible
- Avoid using Core RE as a "filler" for non-specialist teachers or cover arrangements

**Resource Allocation**

- Provide adequate resources for Core RE, including teaching materials, CPD, and budget
- Ensure Core RE teachers have access to subject-specific professional development
- Invest in resources that support engaging, contemporary Core RE (digital resources, visiting speakers, visits)

**Quality Assurance**

- Include Core RE in the school's quality assurance cycle (lesson observation, work scrutiny, assessment review)
- Hold RE subject leaders accountable for the quality of Core RE, not merely examination outcomes
- Monitor compliance with statutory requirements as part of the school's self-evaluation

**Culture and Messaging**

- Articulate a
