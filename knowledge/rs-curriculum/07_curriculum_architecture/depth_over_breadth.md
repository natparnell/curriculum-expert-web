# Depth Over Breadth in Religious Studies Curriculum Design

## Overview

The tension between **depth** and **breadth** in Religious Studies (RE) curriculum design represents one of the most significant challenges facing subject leaders and classroom teachers. The traditional approach—often characterised as the "pie slice" or "tour of world religions" model—has come under increasing scrutiny from Ofsted and subject specialists for prioritising coverage over understanding.

This knowledge file examines the depth-over-breadth paradigm in RE, exploring why the breadth-heavy model persists, what research and inspection evidence reveal about its limitations, and how curriculum designers can construct meaningful, coherent curricula that prioritise genuine understanding of religious and non-religious worldviews.

## The "Pie Slice" Problem

### What Is the Pie Slice Approach?

The pie slice curriculum is the default model in many English schools. In this approach:

- Each term or half-term is allocated to a different religion
- Pupils study Christianity in autumn, Islam in spring, Buddhism in summer (or similar rotation)
- Each religion receives roughly equal time—often just 6-10 hours per year
- The curriculum becomes a rapid tour of religious facts: beliefs, practices, festivals, and key figures
- Connections between topics are limited or non-existent

This model creates what Professor Trevor Cooling has termed "religious tourism"—pupils visit many religions but never truly inhabit any of them. They accumulate surface-level knowledge without developing the disciplinary tools to engage deeply with religious questions.

### Why the Pie Slice Model Persists

Despite widespread recognition of its limitations, the pie slice approach remains dominant for several reasons:

#### 1. Agreed Syllabus Requirements

Many local authority Agreed Syllabuses mandate coverage of multiple religions across key stages. Head teachers and subject leaders interpret these requirements as necessitating the pie slice approach, fearing non-compliance.

#### 2. Parental and Community Expectations

Schools serving diverse communities often feel pressure to give each represented tradition "equal airtime." The pie slice model appears to satisfy demands for inclusion and representation, even when it produces superficial learning.

#### 3. Lack of Subject Expertise

Primary teachers and non-specialist secondary teachers may lack the confidence to teach any religion in depth. The pie slice model allows them to stay one lesson ahead of pupils, teaching content that is easily accessible from textbooks and online resources.

#### 4. Resource Availability

Commercial RE schemes often reinforce the pie slice model, presenting neatly packaged units on each religion. Schools investing in these resources feel compelled to use them as designed.

#### 5. Assessment Habits

When assessment focuses on recall of religious facts—"Name the Five Pillars of Islam"—the pie slice model appears adequate. Shifting to depth requires rethinking what and how we assess.

## The Case for Depth

### Ofsted's Subject Review (2023)

Ofsted's 2023 subject review for Religious Education provided a clear verdict on the depth vs breadth question:

> "In the schools with the strongest RE curricula, leaders had made deliberate decisions to reduce the number of religions studied in depth, rather than attempting to cover many religions superficially."

The review identified that the most effective curricula:

- Focus on **fewer religions studied in greater depth**
- Build **disciplinary knowledge** alongside substantive content
- Prioritise **ways of knowing** (phenomenology, theology, philosophy, social sciences)
- Enable pupils to **engage seriously** with religious and non-religious worldviews
- Make **meaningful connections** across the curriculum

### Research Evidence

#### Cognitive Science

Research on memory and learning supports depth over breadth:

- **Spaced practice** is more effective when content is revisited meaningfully, not superficially
- **Interleaving** different aspects of the same religion produces better retention than blocking whole religions
- **Elaboration**—connecting new knowledge to existing understanding—requires depth of prior knowledge
- **Cognitive overload** occurs when too much disconnected content is presented rapidly

#### The "Paradox of Choice"

Just as too many consumer choices lead to decision paralysis, too many religions taught superficially can lead to cognitive overload. Pupils struggle to distinguish between religions or remember key features of any.

#### Developmental Appropriateness

Young children think in concrete, egocentric ways. Asking them to understand abstract theological concepts across multiple religious traditions simultaneously is developmentally inappropriate. Depth allows pupils to build from concrete to abstract within coherent contexts.

## Curriculum Models That Work

### Model 1: The Core and Satellites Approach

In this model, the curriculum identifies:

- **Core religion(s)**: One or two religions studied in depth across multiple years
- **Satellite religions**: Other traditions encountered in less depth, often thematically

**Example Structure:**
- Christianity as core (60% curriculum time)
- Islam studied with depth but less extensively (25%)
- Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism encountered through thematic units (15%)

This model satisfies Agreed Syllabus requirements for breadth whilst enabling genuine depth in core areas.

### Model 2: The Thematic Depth Model

Rather than organising by religion, this model organises by **big questions** or **themes**:

- How do people respond to suffering?
- What makes a life meaningful?
- How should we treat the natural world?
- What happens when we die?

Within each theme, pupils examine how **multiple religions** approach the question, but with depth in each case. The theme provides coherence; the religions provide varied responses.

**Advantages:**
- Natural connection to pupils' own questions and experiences
- Encourages comparison and evaluation
- Avoids the "list of facts" approach

**Challenges:**
- Requires careful design to ensure each religion is represented accurately
- Teachers need strong subject knowledge across traditions
- Risk of fragmentation if themes are too narrow

### Model 3: The Disciplinary Lens Model

This model organises learning around **ways of studying religion** rather than religions themselves:

- **Theological lens**: How believers understand their own traditions
- **Philosophical lens**: Reasoning about religious questions
- **Social scientific lens**: How religions function in society
- **Phenomenological lens**: Describing and comparing religious phenomena

Each lens is applied to selected religious content, enabling depth whilst developing disciplinary knowledge.

### Model 4: The Case Study Approach

Pupils study a limited number of **in-depth case studies**, each exploring a religion in context:

- Christianity in medieval England (history-integrated)
- Islam in contemporary Britain (sociology-integrated)
- Buddhism in Tibet (geography-integrated)
- Humanism in modern Europe (philosophy-integrated)

Each case study provides depth, context, and connections to other disciplines.

## Selecting Content for Depth

### Principles for Selection

When deciding what to include in a depth-focused curriculum, consider:

#### 1. The Locally Agreed Syllabus

Start with statutory requirements. Most Agreed Syllabuses specify:
- Christianity must be studied in every key stage
- At least two other principal religions across KS1-3
- Opportunities to study non-religious worldviews

Depth can be achieved within these parameters through careful sequencing and extended study.

#### 2. Pupil Context

Consider:
- What religions are represented in the school community?
- What misconceptions or prejudices might pupils hold?
- What questions are pupils genuinely asking?
- What will pupils encounter in their local area?

#### 3. Curriculum Coherence

Select content that:
- Builds logically across key stages
- Allows revisiting and deepening over time
- Connects to other curriculum areas
- Prepares pupils for the next phase of education

#### 4. Disciplinary Progression

Ensure content enables development of:
- **Substantive knowledge**: Core concepts, beliefs, practices
- **Ways of knowing**: Methods for studying religion
- **Personal knowledge**: Pupils' own responses and reflections

### Practical Example: Christianity in Depth

Rather than teaching "Christianity" as a single unit, a depth model might distribute study across key stages:

**KS1:**
- The Christmas story (narrative and meaning)
- Visiting a church (sensory and experiential)

**Lower KS2:**
- Jesus' teachings (parables and their interpretation)
- Christian worship (how and why Christians pray)

**Upper KS2:**
- Christian diversity (denominations and different practices)
- Christianity and ethics (applying Jesus' teachings)

**KS3:**
- The Trinity (developing theological understanding)
- Christianity in Britain today (sociological perspective)
- Christian responses to suffering (philosophical engagement)

Each phase revisits and deepens prior learning, building coherent understanding over time.

## Avoiding the Pitfalls of Depth

### Risk 1: Neglecting Diversity

Depth in one religion can inadvertently present it as monolithic. Effective depth teaching must:

- Acknowledge internal diversity (denominations, interpretations, cultural variations)
- Avoid essentialising "Christianity" or "Islam" as singular, unchanging entities
- Show how religions change over time and across contexts
- Include minority voices and perspectives within traditions

### Risk 2: Reinforcing Majority Privilege

If Christianity receives 60% of curriculum time simply because it is the majority tradition, this may perpetuate Christian privilege. Depth must be justified by:

- Historical and cultural significance in England
- Preparation for GCSE (where Christianity is compulsory)
- The complexity and diversity within Christianity itself

Not merely because "we've always done it this way."

### Risk 3: Losing Breadth Entirely

A pendulum swing from all-breadth to all-depth can leave pupils with no awareness of religious diversity. The goal is **intelligent breadth**—knowing something meaningful about several traditions, not everything superficial about many.

### Risk 4: Teacher Confidence

Teaching in depth requires stronger subject knowledge. Schools must invest in:

- Subject-specific CPD
- High-quality resources
- Expert visitor input
- Links to local faith communities

Without this support, depth can become inaccurate or superficial in new ways.

## Implementation Strategies

### For Primary Schools

#### Strategy 1: Blocked Curriculum

Instead of teaching all religions every year, adopt a blocked approach:

- **Year 1-2:** Christianity in depth
- **Year 3-4:** Islam in depth
- **Year 5-6:** Hinduism or Buddhism in depth

Each block allows genuine depth whilst ensuring breadth across the primary phase.

#### Strategy 2: Golden Threads

Identify concepts that run through the curriculum:

- Symbol and meaning
- Community and belonging
- Stories and their importance
- Ultimate questions

Teach each thread through different religions, building depth through revisiting.

### For Secondary Schools

#### Strategy 1: GCSE Preparation

Since GCSE RS requires depth study of two religions, align KS3 curriculum to:

- Provide depth foundation in Christianity and Islam (the most common GCSE choices)
- Introduce disciplinary approaches needed at GCSE (evaluation, analysis)
- Build vocabulary and conceptual understanding gradually

#### Strategy 2: Thematic Modules

Organise KS3 around themes with depth in selected religions:

- **Module 1:** Beliefs about God (Christianity and Islam in depth)
- **Module 2:** Life after death (Christianity and Hinduism)
- **Module 3:** Ethics (Christianity and secular humanism)
- **Module 4:** Religious experience (Buddhism and Christianity)

Each module provides depth in specific religions whilst building thematic connections.

## Assessment in a Depth-Focused Curriculum

### Moving Beyond Recall

Depth-focused assessment should:

- Require **explanation** not just identification
- Ask pupils to **compare** within and across traditions
- Evaluate **interpretations** of religious sources
- Apply religious concepts to **new contexts**

### Example Assessment: Depth vs Breadth

**Breadth approach:**
> "Name the Five Pillars of Islam."

**Depth approach:**
> "Explain why salah (prayer) is important to Muslims, making reference to both the Qur'an and how Muslims describe its impact on their daily lives. Why might some Muslims find it challenging to pray five times a day in modern Britain?"

### Tracking Progression

In a depth model, progression tracking focuses on:

- Increasing sophistication of explanation
- Ability to handle complexity and diversity
- Development of disciplinary language
- Capacity to engage with ultimate questions

Not merely accumulation of facts about more religions.

## Conclusion: Towards Meaningful RE

The shift from breadth to depth in RE is not merely a curriculum design choice—it is a fundamental reimagining of what religious education is for. The pie slice model produces pupils who know a little about many religions but understand nothing deeply. A depth-focused curriculum, implemented thoughtfully, enables pupils to:

- Engage seriously with religious and non-religious worldviews
- Develop the disciplinary tools for ongoing study
- Appreciate the complexity and diversity within traditions
- Form their own informed responses to ultimate questions
- Participate respectfully in a religiously diverse society

The challenge for curriculum leaders is to resist pressures for superficial coverage and instead design curricula that give pupils the time and tools to encounter religion in depth. As the Ofsted subject review concluded, this requires **deliberate decisions** and **confident leadership**—but the result is RE that truly educates.

## Key Takeaways

1. **The pie slice model** (rapid tour of many religions) produces superficial learning
2. **Depth over breadth** means studying fewer religions more thoroughly
3. **Multiple models** work: core-and-satellites, thematic, disciplinary, case study
4. **Selection principles** include Agreed Syllabus requirements, pupil context, and disciplinary progression
5. **Risks to avoid**: neglecting diversity, reinforcing privilege, losing breadth entirely
6. **Assessment** in depth focuses on explanation, comparison, and application—not recall
