# Disciplinary Knowledge in Religious Education

## Overview

Disciplinary knowledge in Religious Education (RE) refers to the distinct ways of knowing, thinking, and understanding that scholars employ when studying religion. Unlike substantive knowledge (the content of what is taught), disciplinary knowledge concerns how we come to know what we know about religion—the methods, concepts, and analytical frameworks that underpin the academic study of religious phenomena.

In the English education system, the disciplines that inform RE are traditionally understood as theology, philosophy, and the social sciences (primarily sociology and anthropology). These three disciplinary lenses offer complementary yet distinct approaches to understanding religion, each with its own questions, methods, and standards of evidence.

## The Three Disciplines of Religious Education

### Theology

**Definition and Scope**

Theology is the disciplined study of the divine, religious beliefs, and practices from within a faith perspective. It involves systematic reflection on religious truth claims, sacred texts, doctrines, and the lived experience of faith communities. While often associated with training for religious ministry, academic theology maintains critical distance and scholarly rigour.

**Key Characteristics**

Theology operates from what might be called an "insider" perspective—not in the sense of uncritical acceptance, but in taking seriously the internal logic, categories, and self-understanding of religious traditions. The theologian seeks to understand what believers mean by their claims and how these claims cohere within broader systems of thought.

**Questions Theology Asks**

- What do religious texts and traditions teach about God, the sacred, or ultimate reality?
- How have doctrines developed historically within particular traditions?
- How do different theological perspectives interpret the same sacred texts?
- What are the implications of religious beliefs for ethics and practice?
- How do religious communities understand their own identity and mission?

**Methods**

Theological study employs several distinctive methods:

- **Textual exegesis**: Careful interpretation of sacred texts, attending to historical context, literary form, and theological meaning
- **Historical theology**: Tracing the development of doctrines and ideas across time
- **Systematic theology**: Organising and reflecting on the coherence of religious beliefs
- **Comparative theology**: Examining how different traditions address similar questions
- **Practical theology**: Reflecting on the application of religious thought to contemporary issues

**In the Classroom**

Pupils engaging with theological thinking learn to:
- Read sacred texts with attention to their internal logic and meaning
- Understand how religious beliefs are interconnected and systematised
- Recognise that theological questions have been debated within traditions
- Appreciate that religious traditions are living entities that develop over time
- Engage seriously with religious truth claims without necessarily accepting them

### Philosophy

**Definition and Scope**

Philosophy of religion and philosophical theology bring the tools of philosophical analysis to questions of religious significance. Unlike theology, philosophy typically maintains a stance of critical inquiry that does not presuppose the truth of any particular religious tradition. It examines religious concepts, arguments, and beliefs using the methods of rational analysis.

**Key Characteristics**

Philosophy approaches religion with what might be called a "critical outsider" perspective—seeking clarity, coherence, and justification for religious claims without adopting the internal perspective of faith. Philosophers ask whether religious beliefs are meaningful, coherent, and rationally defensible.

**Questions Philosophy Asks**

- Does God exist? What are the arguments for and against?
- Are religious beliefs compatible with scientific understanding?
- How can we reconcile the existence of evil with belief in an all-powerful, all-loving God?
- What is the nature of religious language? Is it cognitive or non-cognitive?
- Do we have free will, and what are the implications for moral responsibility?
- What makes an action right or wrong? Are moral values objective or subjective?
- What is the nature of consciousness, and does it suggest the existence of a soul?

**Methods**

Philosophical inquiry employs distinct methods:

- **Conceptual analysis**: Clarifying the meaning of key terms (God, soul, miracle, faith)
- **Argument evaluation**: Assessing the validity and soundness of arguments for and against religious positions
- **Thought experiments**: Using imaginary scenarios to test intuitions and principles
- **Logical reasoning**: Drawing out implications and identifying contradictions
- **Phenomenological description**: Careful attention to the structure of religious experience

**Major Philosophical Debates**

The philosophy of religion encompasses several enduring debates:

- **The existence of God**: Ontological, cosmological, teleological arguments; problem of evil; arguments from religious experience
- **Faith and reason**: The relationship between belief and evidence; fideism; evidentialism
- **Religious pluralism**: Whether all religions point to the same ultimate reality or make competing claims
- **Life after death**: Arguments for and against the possibility of survival; the nature of personal identity
- **Ethics and religion**: Divine command theory; natural law; the autonomy of ethics

**In the Classroom**

Pupils engaging with philosophical thinking learn to:
- Construct and evaluate arguments with clarity and precision
- Recognise logical fallacies and weak reasoning
- Distinguish between different types of claims (empirical, conceptual, normative)
- Engage with ultimate questions that resist easy answers
- Appreciate that rational disagreement is possible on fundamental questions
- Develop intellectual virtues of open-mindedness and critical thinking

### The Social Sciences

**Definition and Scope**

The social sciences—primarily sociology, anthropology, and psychology—study religion as a human phenomenon, examining its social functions, cultural expressions, and psychological dimensions. Unlike theology and philosophy, the social sciences approach religion from an empirical, descriptive standpoint, seeking to explain why religions exist, how they function, and what effects they have.

**Key Characteristics**

The social sciences maintain a stance of methodological naturalism—they seek natural explanations for religious phenomena without invoking supernatural causes. This does not entail philosophical naturalism (the belief that only natural causes exist), but rather a commitment to examining religion as a feature of human social and cultural life.

**Sociology of Religion**

Sociology examines religion as a social institution, asking:

- How does religion contribute to social cohesion or conflict?
- What functions does religion serve in society?
- How do religious organisations differ in structure and authority?
- What is the relationship between religion and social change?
- How does secularisation affect religious belief and practice?

Key sociological concepts include:
- **Secularisation**: The declining social significance of religion in modern societies
- **Charisma and routinisation**: How religious movements become institutionalised
- **Social integration**: Religion's role in binding communities together
- **Legitimation**: How religion provides authority for social arrangements
- **Religious pluralism**: The coexistence of multiple religious traditions in society

**Anthropology of Religion**

Anthropology examines religion in cultural context, asking:

- How do different cultures understand and practice religion?
- What are the common features of religious belief and practice across cultures?
- How do rituals create and maintain social bonds?
- What is the relationship between religion, symbolism, and meaning?
- How do religious beliefs shape understandings of personhood, time, and space?

Key anthropological concepts include:
- **Ritual**: Formalised, repetitive behaviour with symbolic significance
- **Myth**: Sacred narratives that express fundamental cultural values
- **Totemism**: The use of symbols to represent group identity
- **Rites of passage**: Rituals marking transitions in the life cycle
- **Symbolic anthropology**: The study of religion as a system of meaning

**Psychology of Religion**

Psychology examines the individual dimensions of religious experience, asking:

- Why do individuals believe in God or the supernatural?
- What psychological functions does religion serve?
- How does religion affect mental health and wellbeing?
- What are the cognitive foundations of religious belief?
- How do religious experiences relate to normal and altered states of consciousness?

**In the Classroom**

Pupils engaging with social scientific thinking learn to:
- View religion as a human phenomenon with social and psychological dimensions
- Recognise that religious belief and practice vary across cultures and time periods
- Understand that religious institutions have social functions and effects
- Appreciate the diversity of religious expression worldwide
- Examine the relationship between religion and social change
- Use empirical evidence to support claims about religious phenomena

## Integration of the Three Disciplines

### Complementary Perspectives

The three disciplines of RE offer distinct but complementary perspectives:

**Theology** takes seriously the internal perspective of religious traditions, examining what believers believe and why.

**Philosophy** brings critical rationality to religious claims, asking whether they are coherent, meaningful, and defensible.

**Social sciences** explain religion as a human phenomenon, examining its causes, functions, and effects in social life.

No single discipline provides a complete picture of religion. The theology of Hinduism tells us what Hindus believe; the philosophy of religion asks whether those beliefs are rationally defensible; the sociology of religion examines how Hinduism functions in Indian society. All three perspectives are necessary for a full understanding.

### The Role of Personal Knowledge

While the three disciplines provide academic frameworks, RE also recognises the importance of personal knowledge—the lived experience of religious belief and practice. Pupils from faith backgrounds bring insider knowledge of their traditions; pupils without religious affiliation bring perspectives shaped by secular culture. Both are valuable resources for learning.

The challenge is to hold personal knowledge in productive tension with disciplinary knowledge:

- Personal knowledge provides authenticity and motivation for learning
- Disciplinary knowledge provides critical distance and analytical tools
- Personal knowledge without discipline risks naivety and parochialism
- Disciplinary knowledge without personal engagement risks abstraction and irrelevance

### The "Ways of Knowing" Framework

The Religious Education Council of England and Wales has articulated a framework of "ways of knowing" that maps onto disciplinary knowledge:

**Theological**: Understanding how religious traditions understand themselves—their beliefs, practices, texts, and authorities.

**Philosophical**: Critical reflection on religious questions using reason and argument.

**Human/Social Scientific**: Studying religion as a human phenomenon using empirical methods.

**Phenomenological**: Attentive description of religious phenomena as they appear to consciousness, bracketing questions of truth.

This framework helps teachers ensure that pupils encounter religion through multiple disciplinary lenses.

## Teaching Disciplinary Knowledge

### Why Disciplinary Knowledge Matters

**Intellectual Rigor**

Without disciplinary knowledge, RE risks becoming merely descriptive or devotional. Disciplines provide standards of evidence and argument that distinguish academic RE from religious instruction or casual conversation about religion.

**Conceptual Clarity**

Disciplines help pupils understand that there are different kinds of questions one can ask about religion, each requiring different approaches. The question "What do Christians believe about the afterlife?" is theological; "Is there evidence for life after death?" is philosophical; "Why do people believe in an afterlife?" is social scientific.

**Critical Thinking**

Engaging with multiple disciplines develops critical thinking skills. Pupils learn to evaluate arguments, assess evidence, recognise assumptions, and distinguish between different types of claims.

**Preparation for Further Study**

Pupils who encounter disciplinary knowledge in RE are better prepared for study at A-level and university, where theology, philosophy, and religious studies are taught as distinct disciplines.

### Progression in Disciplinary Understanding

**Key Stage 1 (Ages 5-7)**

At this stage, the focus is on building foundational substantive knowledge about religious traditions. Disciplinary concepts are introduced implicitly through:
- Listening to and retelling religious stories
- Exploring religious practices and artefacts
- Asking and responding to questions about religious meaning

While explicit disciplinary language is not used, pupils begin to understand that there are different ways of knowing—through stories, through asking questions, through observing practices.

**Key Stage 2 (Ages 7-11)**

Disciplinary thinking becomes more explicit:
- Pupils learn to read sacred texts with attention to meaning and interpretation
- They engage with ultimate questions and different possible answers
- They begin to recognise that people study religion in different ways
- They encounter the idea that there are religious, philosophical, and social scientific perspectives

**Key Stage 3 (Ages 11-14)**

Disciplinary knowledge is developed more systematically:
- Pupils learn to identify theological, philosophical, and social scientific questions
- They practise using appropriate methods for each discipline
- They encounter disciplinary debates and disagreements
- They begin to integrate multiple perspectives on religious phenomena

**Key Stage 4 (Ages 14-16)**

GCSE RE requires sophisticated engagement with disciplinary knowledge:
- Pupils analyse and evaluate arguments using philosophical methods
- They interpret religious texts using theological approaches
- They explain religious phenomena using social scientific concepts
- They synthesise multiple disciplinary perspectives in response to complex questions

### Pedagogical Strategies

**Explicit Teaching of Disciplinary Concepts**

Teachers should explicitly name the disciplines and their methods:
- "From a theological perspective, we would ask..."
- "Philosophers approach this question by..."
- "Sociologists have found that..."

This metacognitive approach helps pupils develop a conceptual map of disciplinary knowledge.

**Source-Based Learning**

Engaging with primary sources from each discipline:
- Sacred texts for theology
- Philosophical arguments for philosophy
- Ethnographic accounts for anthropology
- Survey data for sociology

**Debate and Discussion**

Structured debates help pupils understand how different disciplines approach the same question:
- "Is religion a force for good in society?" (theological, philosophical, sociological perspectives)
- "Does God exist?" (philosophical arguments; theological responses)
- "Why do people pray?" (theological, psychological, sociological explanations)

**Comparative Analysis**

Asking pupils to compare how different disciplines answer the same question develops understanding of disciplinary distinctiveness.

**Research Projects**

Extended projects allow pupils to apply disciplinary methods:
- Theological investigation of a doctrine or practice
- Philosophical analysis of a religious argument
- Social scientific study of a local religious community

## Challenges in Teaching Disciplinary Knowledge

### The Teacher's Own Expertise

Few RE teachers have formal training in all three disciplines. Most have backgrounds in theology, philosophy, or social science, but rarely all three. This can lead to:
- Overemphasis on the discipline the teacher knows best
- Simplified or inaccurate representation of other disciplines
- Difficulty in helping pupils integrate multiple perspectives

**Strategies for addressing this:**
- Professional development in disciplines outside one's specialism
- Collaborative planning with colleagues who have different expertise
- Use of disciplinary experts through video, text, or guest speakers
- Honesty with pupils about the limits of one's own expertise

### The Risk of Reductionism

Each discipline risks reducing religion to something less than believers understand it to be:
- Philosophy reduces religion to arguments and propositions
- Sociology reduces religion to social functions
- Psychology reduces religion to psychological needs

Theology can seem to reduce religion to doctrine, neglecting lived practice.

The antidote is to:
- Present disciplines as complementary, not competing
- Show how each discipline reveals something important
- Maintain respect for religion as a complex, multifaceted phenomenon
- Allow religious voices to speak for themselves, not only through academic analysis

### Balancing Neutrality and Commitment

RE seeks to be neutral between religious and non-religious worldviews, but disciplines themselves have histories and biases:
- Theology emerged from Christian contexts and may not fit other traditions equally well
- Philosophy has often been shaped by secular assumptions
- Social science has sometimes been hostile to religion

Teachers should:
- Be aware of disciplinary biases and their histories
- Present multiple perspectives within each discipline
- Include voices from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds
- Model critical engagement with disciplinary methods, not just religious content

### Assessment Challenges

Assessing disciplinary knowledge is complex:
- Does the pupil understand the theological perspective, or merely repeat theological claims?
- Can the pupil engage philosophically, or merely describe philosophical positions?
- Does the pupil apply social scientific concepts, or simply mention them?

Effective assessment requires:
- Clear criteria distinguishing knowledge of disciplines from ability to use them
- Tasks that require application and evaluation, not just description
- Feedback that develops disciplinary thinking, not just content recall

## Disciplinary Knowledge and the Wider Curriculum

### Connections with Other Subjects

RE's disciplinary knowledge connects with other curriculum areas:

**English**: Textual interpretation, critical reading, evaluation of arguments
**History**: Historical understanding of religious change, use of primary sources
**Science**: The relationship between scientific and religious ways of knowing
**Geography**: The spatial distribution of religions, religious landscapes
**Sociology and Psychology**: Shared concepts and methods (where offered)
**Philosophy**: Direct continuity with the philosophy of religion

These connections can be made explicit to reinforce disciplinary understanding across the curriculum.

### Contribution to Spiritual, Moral, Social and Cultural Development

Disciplinary knowledge in RE contributes to SMSC by:
- Enabling pupils to engage seriously with ultimate questions (spiritual)
- Developing ethical reasoning and moral judgment (moral)
- Fostering understanding of diverse perspectives (social)
- Introducing pupils to rich cultural heritages (cultural)

### British Values

Disciplinary knowledge supports the promotion of British values:
- **Democracy**: Understanding how religious and philosophical perspectives inform political participation
- **The rule of law**: Exploring religious and secular foundations for law and morality
- **Individual liberty**: Examining different conceptions of freedom and autonomy
- **Mutual respect**: Understanding religious diversity through multiple disciplinary lenses

---

## Conclusion

Disciplinary knowledge is the foundation of rigorous Religious Education. Theology, philosophy, and the social sciences offer distinct but complementary ways of understanding religion, each with its own questions, methods, and contributions. 

Teaching disciplinary knowledge requires explicit attention to how we know what we know about religion, helping pupils develop the intellectual tools to engage seriously with religious phenomena. This approach distinguishes academic RE from religious instruction, fostering the critical thinking, open-mindedness, and intellectual humility that characterise educated engagement with
religion in a pluralistic society.

As pupils progress through their RE education, they should increasingly be able to identify which discipline is appropriate for which question, to apply disciplinary methods with increasing sophistication, and to synthesise multiple perspectives in their understanding of religious phenomena. This disciplinary competence prepares them not only for further academic study but also for responsible citizenship in a diverse and complex world.

The development of disciplinary knowledge in RE is not merely an academic exercise—it is an essential component of education for living well in a pluralistic society. In a world where religious differences can be sources of both profound meaning and deep conflict, the ability to understand religion through multiple disciplinary lenses is an invaluable skill. It enables pupils to engage respectfully with those who hold different views, to think critically about religious claims, and to appreciate the richness and complexity of human religious expression.

## Building Expertise in Disciplinary Thinking

### Developing Scholarly Habits of Mind

Beyond acquiring knowledge of the three disciplines, pupils need to develop the habits of mind characteristic of scholarly engagement with religion. These include:

**Intellectual Humility**

Recognising the limits of one's own knowledge and understanding. In RE, this means acknowledging that religious questions often resist definitive answers, that intelligent people disagree about fundamental issues, and that one's own perspective is shaped by cultural and personal factors that may not be universal.

**Epistemic Curiosity**

A genuine desire to understand how others see the world. This involves being interested in religious beliefs and practices not merely as objects of study but as expressions of human meaning-making that can inform one's own understanding.

**Respectful Critique**

The ability to evaluate arguments and claims without dismissing the people who hold them. This is particularly important in RE, where beliefs may be deeply connected to identity and community.

**Synthesis and Integration**

The capacity to bring together insights from different disciplines to form a coherent understanding. This higher-order skill develops over time and represents the culmination of disciplinary education in RE.

### Metacognitive Development

Pupils benefit from explicit reflection on their own thinking:

- What kind of question am I asking? (theological, philosophical, social scientific)
- What kind of evidence would be relevant to answering it?
- What are the strengths and limitations of the approach I am using?
- How might another discipline shed light on this question?

Teachers can foster metacognition through modelling, questioning, and structured reflection activities.

### The Role of Narrative

While disciplinary knowledge emphasises analysis and argument, narrative remains important in RE. Religious traditions are transmitted through stories, and personal narratives of belief and doubt illuminate abstract concepts. Effective RE weaves together narrative and disciplinary approaches:

- Using stories to illustrate and personalise disciplinary concepts
- Applying disciplinary tools to analyse religious narratives
- Encouraging pupils to articulate their own developing understanding in narrative form

### Developing Research Skills

As pupils progress, they should increasingly engage with primary sources and scholarly literature:

**Using Sacred Texts**

Learning to read sacred texts with appropriate scholarly methods—not as simple sources of information but as complex documents requiring interpretation. This includes attention to:
- Historical and cultural context
- Literary genre and form
- Translation issues
- Interpretive traditions

**Engaging with Scholarship**

Introducing pupils to academic writing about religion:
- Reading accessible scholarly articles
- Understanding how academics construct arguments
- Evaluating different scholarly perspectives
- Citing sources appropriately

**Conducting Empirical Inquiry**

For social scientific approaches, pupils can:
- Design and conduct surveys on religious attitudes
- Interview members of religious communities
- Observe and document religious practices
- Analyse demographic data on religious affiliation

---

## Disciplinary Knowledge and Teacher Professional Development

### Subject Knowledge Enhancement

RE teachers need ongoing professional development to maintain and extend their disciplinary expertise:

- Reading in theology, philosophy, and social science
- Attending academic conferences and public lectures
- Engaging with online courses and resources
- Participating in subject association activities

### Collaborative Expertise

Given that few teachers are experts in all three disciplines, collaboration is essential:

- Departmental teams can share expertise across disciplines
- Partnerships with university departments can provide academic input
- Online communities enable sharing of resources and ideas
- Mentoring relationships support new teachers in developing disciplinary knowledge

### Staying Current

The academic study of religion is dynamic, with new research constantly emerging:

- The cognitive science of religion offers new insights into religious belief
- Postcolonial scholarship challenges traditional disciplinary assumptions
- Digital humanities are transforming how religious texts are studied
- Global Christianity and other religious shifts require updated content knowledge

Teachers should model the lifelong learning they wish to instil in their pupils.

---

## Assessment of Disciplinary Knowledge

### Formative Assessment Strategies

Ongoing assessment helps pupils develop disciplinary thinking:

**Diagnostic Tasks**

At the beginning of units, assess pupils' current disciplinary understanding:
- How would you find out what Muslims believe about the Prophet Muhammad? (theological)
- Is there good evidence for the existence of God? (philosophical)
- Why do some people stop believing in religion? (social scientific)

Pupils' responses reveal which disciplines they naturally gravitate toward and where explicit instruction is needed.

**Process Questions**

During lessons, probe pupils' disciplinary thinking:
- "What kind of question is that?"
- "What discipline would help us answer it?"
- "What would a philosopher say about this?"
- "How might a sociologist explain that?"

**Exit Tickets**

Quick formative checks at lesson end:
- Name one theological question we considered today
- Give an example of philosophical reasoning from the lesson
- What social scientific concept did we use?

### Summative Assessment Design

Effective summative assessments require pupils to demonstrate disciplinary competence:

**Disciplinary Identification**

Questions that require pupils to recognise which discipline is appropriate:
- "Is this a theological, philosophical, or social scientific question? Explain your answer."

**Application Tasks**

Questions that require pupils to apply disciplinary methods:
- "Use sociological concepts to explain why religious attendance has declined in Britain."
- "Evaluate the philosophical argument for the existence of God presented in the extract."
- "Explain different theological interpretations of the creation narratives in Genesis."

**Integration Tasks**

Higher-tariff questions requiring synthesis:
- "To what extent do theological and sociological perspectives on prayer complement or conflict with each other?"
- "Using insights from at least two disciplines, discuss the significance of pilgrimage in contemporary religious practice."

**Mark Schemes**

Mark schemes should reward:
- Accurate use of disciplinary concepts
- Appropriate application of disciplinary methods
- Recognition of the limits of particular disciplines
- Integration of multiple perspectives where appropriate

---

## The Future of Disciplinary Knowledge in RE

### Emerging Trends

Several developments are shaping how disciplinary knowledge is conceptualised in RE:

**Interdisciplinarity**

There is growing recognition that the boundaries between disciplines are porous. The cognitive science of religion, for example, draws on psychology, anthropology, and neuroscience. Religious studies as an academic field increasingly emphasises interdisciplinary approaches.

**Global Perspectives**

Traditional disciplinary frameworks have been critiqued for their Western, Christian biases. There is increasing attention to:
- How other cultures and traditions conceptualise knowledge about religion
- The diversity of theological traditions beyond Christianity
- Non-Western philosophical perspectives
- Indigenous knowledge systems

**Digital Developments**

Technology is transforming how religion is studied:
- Digital archives make primary sources more accessible
- Data analytics enable new kinds of social scientific research
- Virtual reality offers immersive experiences of religious sites
- Social media provides unprecedented data on religious attitudes and practices

**Pluralism and Representation**

There is ongoing debate about how to represent diverse religious and non-religious perspectives within disciplinary frameworks:
- How can theology engage seriously with traditions that do not centre on belief in God?
- How can philosophy include non-Western philosophical traditions?
- How can social science avoid pathologising minority religious communities?

### Implications for Curriculum Development

These trends suggest several directions for RE curriculum development:

- Greater attention to the assumptions underlying disciplinary frameworks
- More explicit engagement with diversity within and across traditions
- Integration of new research findings and methods
- Critical reflection on the history and politics of the study of religion
- Flexibility to incorporate emerging approaches while maintaining disciplinary rigour

## Summary: Key Principles for Teaching Disciplinary Knowledge

1. **Explicitness**: Name the disciplines and their methods explicitly so pupils develop a conceptual map of different ways of knowing about religion.

2. **Complementarity**: Present the three disciplines as offering complementary rather than competing perspectives.

3. **Progression**: Develop disciplinary thinking gradually, from implicit exposure in primary years to sophisticated integration at GCSE and beyond.

4. **Application**: Provide opportunities for pupils to apply disciplinary methods, not merely learn about them.

5. **Integration**: Help pupils synthesise insights from multiple disciplines in response to complex questions.

6. **Critique**: Encourage critical reflection on the strengths and limitations of each disciplinary approach.

7. **Personal Connection**: Maintain space for pupils' own perspectives and experiences while developing disciplinary distance.

8. **Authenticity**: Use genuine disciplinary sources and methods rather than simplified or distorted versions.

9. **Assessment**: Design assessments that require demonstration of disciplinary competence, not just recall of disciplinary content.

10. **Teacher Development**: Invest in ongoing professional learning to maintain and extend disciplinary expertise.

By attending to these principles, RE teachers can ensure that their pupils develop genuine disciplinary knowledge—the understanding not only of what people believe and do in relation to religion, but of how we know what we know about these matters, and why that matters for living well together in a complex world.
