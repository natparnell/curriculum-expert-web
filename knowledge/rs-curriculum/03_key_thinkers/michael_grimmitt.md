# Michael Grimmitt: Learning About and Learning From Religion

## Biography and Academic Career

Michael Grimmitt (1931–2018) was one of the most influential figures in British religious education during the late twentieth century. A teacher, researcher, and academic, Grimmitt dedicated his career to developing pedagogical frameworks that would enable religious education to fulfil its educational potential within secular, pluralistic school systems. His work bridged the gap between the academic study of religion and the personal development of pupils, establishing theoretical foundations that continue to shape RE curriculum design and classroom practice in the United Kingdom today.

Grimmitt began his professional life as a teacher of religious education in secondary schools, spending sixteen years in the classroom before transitioning to teacher education and research. This extensive classroom experience gave him a deep appreciation for the practical challenges facing RE teachers, whilst also informing his conviction that religious education could and should make a significant contribution to pupils' overall development. In 1973, whilst working at the Regional RE Centre (Midlands) in Birmingham, Grimmitt proposed a groundbreaking pedagogy for non-confessional RE that explicitly described the different needs and intentions of religious organisations and governments within secular societies. This early work laid the groundwork for his later, more developed theoretical contributions.

Following his time at the Regional RE Centre, where he contributed to the influential Westhill Project and eventually became its Director, Grimmitt joined the University of Birmingham's School of Education. For over ten years, he worked training secondary religious education teachers, during which period he refined and elaborated his pedagogical theories. It was at Birmingham that he produced his most significant scholarly work, including his doctoral thesis which formed the basis of his seminal 1987 book *Religious Education and Human Development: The Relationship Between Studying Religions and Personal, Social and Moral Education*.

Throughout his career, Grimmitt maintained a commitment to making RE both educationally rigorous and personally meaningful. He rejected approaches that saw religious education merely as information transmission about religious traditions, arguing instead for a pedagogy that engaged pupils actively in constructing their understanding whilst also enabling them to reflect upon their own beliefs, values, and ways of living. This dual commitment—to academic integrity and personal development—remains the defining characteristic of his contribution to the field.

## The Distinction: Learning About and Learning From Religion

Grimmitt's most enduring contribution to religious education theory and practice is his conceptual distinction between "learning about religion" and "learning from religion." First introduced by Grimmitt and his colleague Garth Read in 1975, these terms have become foundational to how British RE is conceived, taught, and assessed. They were subsequently incorporated into the National Framework for RE (2004) and remain central to the nature of RE as articulated in the 2013 Curriculum Framework and beyond.

### Learning About Religion

"Learning about religion" refers to the cognitive dimension of religious education: the acquisition of knowledge and understanding about religious traditions, beliefs, practices, and their expressions in human culture. This dimension encompasses pupils learning about the beliefs, teachings, and practices of the major religious traditions of the world, as well as non-religious worldviews where appropriate. Grimmitt conceived of this learning as essentially phenomenological in character, drawing upon the phenomenology of religion as developed by scholars such as Ninian Smart.

The "learning about" dimension serves several important educational functions. It provides pupils with accurate, balanced information about religious and non-religious traditions, enabling them to understand how these traditions shape individuals and communities. It develops critical thinking skills through the examination of religious claims, texts, and practices. It promotes religious literacy, equipping pupils with the conceptual tools necessary to engage intelligently with religious diversity in contemporary society. And it establishes the foundation upon which the second dimension—learning from religion—can authentically proceed.

Grimmitt was clear, however, that "learning about religion" by itself constitutes an incomplete religious education. Whilst necessary, this dimension alone does not fulfil the full educational potential of the subject, nor does it adequately address the needs and interests of pupils as developing persons.

### Learning From Religion

"Learning from religion" refers to the existential and experiential dimension of religious education: the opportunity for pupils to reflect upon, respond to, and potentially be changed by their engagement with religious material. This dimension recognises that studying religion is not merely an academic exercise but also an opportunity for personal growth, as pupils encounter different ways of understanding the world, different value systems, and different responses to fundamental human questions.

Grimmitt articulated this dimension as enabling pupils to "learn something from their studies in religion about themselves" (Grimmitt, 1987, pp. 225–226). This involves opportunities for pupils to consider their own beliefs, values, and ways of living in the light of what they have learned about religious traditions. It does not entail proselytisation or the imposition of religious beliefs; rather, it creates space for pupils to engage existentially with religious material and to draw from that engagement insights that may inform their own developing worldviews.

The "learning from" dimension addresses what Grimmitt saw as a central purpose of education: the development of the whole person. By engaging with how religious traditions address questions of meaning, purpose, mortality, relationships, and ethics, pupils are invited to reflect upon their own positions on these fundamental issues. This reflective engagement can contribute to pupils' spiritual, moral, social, and cultural development, aligning RE with broader educational aims.

### The Relationship Between the Two Dimensions

Crucially, Grimmitt insisted that these two dimensions are not separate or sequential but integrated and mutually reinforcing. Authentic "learning from" requires adequate "learning about"; pupils cannot meaningfully reflect upon or respond to religious material without accurate understanding of what they are engaging with. Conversely, "learning about" without opportunities for "learning from" renders RE incomplete and educationally impoverished, reducing the subject to mere information transmission.

Grimmitt conceptualised this relationship as the study of religion playing an instrumental role in RE pedagogy. Religious material is not studied merely for its own sake (as it might be in a university theology or religious studies department) but as a means to broader educational ends: the development of pupils' understanding, capacities, and self-awareness. This instrumental orientation distinguishes school RE from academic religious studies whilst maintaining intellectual integrity through rigorous "learning about."

The integration of these dimensions seeks to combine what Grimmitt termed "pupil-structured" and "content-structured" principles. Content-structured approaches emphasise the systematic study of religious traditions, ensuring coverage and accuracy. Pupil-structured approaches emphasise the starting points of learners, their questions, experiences, and developmental needs. Grimmitt's framework attempts a synthesis, though arguably one that tilts slightly in favour of pupil-structured approaches, particularly in the emphasis on "learning from."

## The Westhill Project (1986)

The Westhill Project represents a significant practical application of Grimmitt's pedagogical thinking, developed during his time as Director of the Regional RE Centre (Midlands) at Westhill College, Birmingham. The Project, formally published in 1986, was one of several major curriculum development initiatives in British RE during this period, alongside projects such as the Chichester Project and the Religious Experience and Education Project.

### Origins and Context

The Westhill Project emerged from a recognition that RE in British schools was often failing to engage pupils meaningfully or to achieve its educational potential. Confessional approaches, which had dominated much RE practice historically, were increasingly problematic in a pluralistic, secular educational system. Phenomenological approaches, whilst an improvement in terms of neutrality and academic rigour, sometimes resulted in dry, detached study that failed to connect with pupils' own lives and concerns.

The Westhill Project team, led by Grimmitt and including colleague John Rudge, sought to develop a pedagogy that would enable RE to contribute authentically to pupils' development without lapsing into indoctrination or religious nurture. The Project was based at the Regional RE Centre, which served as a hub for RE curriculum development, teacher training, and research in the West Midlands and beyond.

### Core Aims and Principles

The Westhill Project was explicitly concerned with "maturing pupils' patterns of belief and behaviour." This formulation captured the Project's twin focus: on pupils' developing beliefs (understood broadly to include worldviews, values, and commitments) and on their behaviour (understood as the practical expression of those beliefs in action). The Project recognised that education in religion inevitably engages with these dimensions of personhood, and sought to do so in ways that were educationally legitimate within a non-confessional framework.

A distinctive feature of the Westhill Project was its emphasis on the instrumental role of studying religion. The Project stressed that the study of religion should play an instrumental role in RE pedagogy, meaning that religious material was studied not merely for its own sake but as a means to broader educational ends. This instrumental orientation aligned closely with Grimmitt's developing distinction between "learning about" and "learning from" religion.

The Project also emphasised the importance of pupils' own beliefs and questions. For both Grimmitt and the Westhill Project, religious and other beliefs, and pupils' own questions, were understood as part of a wider category of human existence. These were validated in lessons not because they were necessarily correct or because the teacher shared them, but because they represented authentic starting points for educational engagement with religious material.

### Pedagogical Approach

The Westhill Project developed specific pedagogical strategies to realise its aims. These included:

**Pupil-Generated Questions**: The Project emphasised the importance of beginning with pupils' own questions about religion, life, and meaning. This pupil-structured principle ensured that RE engaged with what pupils actually wanted to know and think about, rather than imposing a predetermined curriculum agenda.

**Experiential and Reflective Activities**: The Project incorporated activities designed to enable pupils to engage experientially with religious material and then reflect upon that engagement. This might include encountering religious artefacts, participating in (or observing) religious practices, or engaging with religious narratives and symbols.

**Critical Reflection**: Alongside experiential engagement, the Project emphasised critical reflection. Pupils were encouraged not merely to experience or absorb religious material but to question, evaluate, and assess it. This critical dimension was essential to maintaining educational integrity and avoiding any form of religious nurture.

**Integration of Content and Process**: The Westhill Project sought to integrate what was taught (content) with how it was taught (process). The pedagogical methods were not merely neutral delivery mechanisms but integral to the educational outcomes, particularly the "learning from" dimension.

### Legacy of the Westhill Project

The Westhill Project contributed significantly to the development of British RE, influencing subsequent curriculum frameworks, syllabi, and classroom practice. Its emphasis on pupils' own beliefs and questions, on the instrumental role of studying religion, and on the integration of cognitive and experiential dimensions became central features of mainstream RE pedagogy.

John Rudge's subsequent writing on the Project, including his chapter "The Westhill Project: Religious Education as Maturing Pupils' Patterns of Belief and Behaviour" in Grimmitt's 2000 edited volume *Pedagogies of Religious Education*, ensured that the Project's insights were disseminated to successive generations of RE teachers and curriculum developers.

## Constructivist Pedagogies in RE

In his later work, particularly his contribution to the 2000 volume *Pedagogies of Religious Education*, Grimmitt articulated a constructivist approach to RE that built upon and extended his earlier thinking about "learning about" and "learning from" religion.

### Constructivist Foundations

Grimmitt's constructivist pedagogy is grounded in the recognition that knowledge is not simply transmitted from teacher to pupil but actively constructed by learners through their engagement with material, their reflection upon experience, and their interaction with others. This epistemological position has significant implications for how RE is conceived and practised.

In a constructivist RE classroom, pupils are not passive recipients of information about religious traditions but active meaning-makers who construct their understanding through inquiry, dialogue, and reflection. The teacher's role shifts from authority and transmitter to facilitator and guide, creating opportunities and providing resources for pupils' constructive engagement with religious material.

Grimmitt articulated this approach as "re-thinking knowledge, teaching and learning in religious education." He challenged what he saw as the captivity of RE to inappropriate models—whether confessional models that sought to nurture religious faith, or overly academic models that treated religious material purely as objects of detached study. Instead, he proposed a model that took seriously both the nature of religious knowledge and the needs of learners as developing persons.

### Implications for Classroom Practice

Grimmitt's constructivist pedagogy has several key implications for RE classroom practice:

**Active Learning**: Pupils are engaged in active inquiry rather than passive reception. This might involve investigating religious practices, interpreting religious texts, comparing religious beliefs, or exploring religious responses to ethical questions. The emphasis is on pupils doing the work of understanding rather than simply receiving pre-packaged information.

**Dialogue and Discussion**: Constructivist RE emphasises dialogue—between pupils and teacher, among pupils, and between pupils and religious material. Through dialogue, pupils articulate and refine their understanding, encounter alternative perspectives, and develop their capacity for reasoned discussion about matters of belief and value.

**Reflection and Metacognition**: Pupils are encouraged to reflect not only on religious material but on their own learning processes. This metacognitive dimension enables pupils to become more aware of how they construct understanding and to develop more sophisticated approaches to learning about and from religion.

**Connection to Experience**: Constructivist RE seeks to connect religious material to pupils' own experiences, questions, and concerns. This connection makes learning meaningful and relevant whilst also enabling the "learning from" dimension as pupils relate religious material to their own lives.

### Critique and Development

Grimmitt's constructivist approach has been subject to various critiques and developments. Some have questioned whether constructivism adequately accounts for the distinctive nature of religious knowledge, which may involve claims to revelation, tradition, and authority that do not fit easily with constructivist epistemology. Others have argued that Grimmitt's approach, despite its intentions, can inadvertently reinforce pupils' existing beliefs rather than genuinely challenging and developing them.

Nevertheless, Grimmitt's constructivist pedagogy has been highly influential in moving British RE away from both confessional and purely phenomenological approaches towards a more educationally grounded model. His insistence that RE must engage with how pupils actually learn and develop has informed subsequent curriculum developments and continues to influence RE practice today.

## Pedagogical Models

Throughout his work, Grimmitt articulated and advocated for specific pedagogical models that could realise the educational potential of RE. These models attempted to operationalise his theoretical framework in ways that could guide curriculum planning and classroom practice.

### The Human Development Model

Central to Grimmitt's thinking was what might be termed a "human development model" of RE. This model conceives of religious education as contributing to pupils' personal, social, and moral development through structured engagement with religious material. The model is elaborated most fully in Grimmitt's 1987 book *Religious Education and Human Development*.

In this model, studying religion is understood as having the potential to contribute to various dimensions of human development:

**Cognitive Development**: Engagement with religious material develops pupils' capacity for abstract thought, conceptual understanding, and reasoning about matters that are not empirically verifiable. Religious traditions offer sophisticated conceptual frameworks for understanding reality, meaning, and value, and engaging with these frameworks can advance pupils' cognitive development.

**Emotional Development**: Religion addresses fundamental human emotions—hope, fear, love, guilt, wonder—and studying how religious traditions understand and respond to these emotions can contribute to pupils' own emotional development and literacy.

**Social Development**: Religious traditions embody particular forms of community and social organisation, and studying these can contribute to pupils' social understanding and development. Additionally, the encounter with religious diversity can promote social cohesion and mutual understanding in pluralistic societies.

**Moral Development**: Religious traditions typically involve ethical teachings and moral frameworks, and engagement with these can contribute to pupils' moral reasoning and development. Grimmitt was careful to distinguish this from moral indoctrination, emphasising that pupils should engage critically with religious ethics rather than simply absorb them.

**Spiritual Development**: For Grimmitt, engagement with religious material could contribute to pupils' spiritual development, understood broadly as their developing sense of meaning, purpose, and connectedness. This dimension is particularly associated with the "learning from" aspect of RE.

### The Integration Model

Grimmitt also advocated for what might be called an "integration model," which seeks to integrate RE with other areas of the curriculum and with broader educational aims. Rather than treating RE as an isolated subject concerned only with religious material, this model sees RE as contributing to—and drawing upon—learning across the curriculum.

This integration operates in several directions. RE contributes to spiritual, moral, social, and cultural development (SMSC), which is a statutory requirement for all schools in England. RE connects with citizenship education through its engagement with diversity, community, and values. RE relates to personal, social, health and economic education (PSHE) through its address to questions of identity, relationships, and wellbeing. And RE links with English, history, art, and other subjects through shared engagement with cultural material.

Grimmitt argued that this integration was not merely a matter of administrative convenience but reflected the reality that religious and non-religious worldviews permeate human culture and experience. Understanding religion requires drawing upon multiple disciplinary perspectives, and engagement with religion can illuminate learning across the curriculum.

### Models of Differentiation

Grimmitt was also concerned with how RE should be differentiated to meet the needs of different pupils. He recognised that pupils come to RE with very different backgrounds—some with extensive religious socialisation, others with none; some from faith communities, others with no religious affiliation; some convinced believers, others agnostics or atheists.

Grimmitt's framework attempts to accommodate this diversity through its distinction between "learning about" and "learning from." All pupils can engage in "learning about" religion, regardless of their own beliefs, as this is essentially an educational activity concerned with understanding. "Learning from" religion is also open to all pupils, though the nature of what is learned and how it is applied will vary depending on the pupil's own worldview.

For pupils from religious backgrounds, RE can provide opportunities to deepen and critically examine their inherited beliefs. For pupils from non-religious backgrounds, RE can provide access to religious ways of understanding that may enrich their own developing worldviews. For all pupils, RE offers exposure to diversity and the development of skills for engaging respectfully and critically with different perspectives.
