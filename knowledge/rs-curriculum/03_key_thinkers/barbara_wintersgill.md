# Barbara Wintersgill: Big Ideas for Religious Education

## Introduction and Overview

Barbara Wintersgill stands as one of the most influential figures in contemporary English religious education (RE), having shaped national policy, curriculum design, and pedagogical practice over several decades. As a former Her Majesty's Inspector (HMI) specialising in RE, Professional Officer for RE at both the National Curriculum Council (NCC) and the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority (SCAA), and now Associate Fellow at the University of Exeter, Wintersgill has been uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between policy imperatives and classroom realities. Her most significant contribution to the field is the development of the "Big Ideas for Religious Education" framework, a curriculum approach that has influenced not only how RE is taught in schools but also the recommendations of the 2018 Commission on Religious Education and the subsequent National Statement of Entitlement.

Wintersgill's work emerges from a deep concern about the quality and purpose of religious education in English schools. Throughout her career, she has observed the marginalisation of RE within the curriculum, the inconsistency in its delivery, and the lack of coherent frameworks for determining what constitutes high-quality RE. The Big Ideas project, which she launched in 2016, represents her response to these challenges—a systematic attempt to identify the essential knowledge and understanding that pupils should acquire through their RE education, organised around six overarching concepts that provide coherence and progression across the 5-18 age range.

## Career and Professional Background

### Teaching and Early Career

Barbara Wintersgill began her career in education as a classroom teacher of religious education in London, where she spent fifteen years working in secondary schools. For much of this period, she served as Head of Department, giving her direct experience of the challenges facing RE teachers in managing diverse classrooms, developing curriculum sequences, and securing the status of the subject within increasingly crowded school timetables. This grassroots experience has informed all her subsequent work; unlike many policymakers who have never taught, Wintersgill brings first-hand knowledge of what works in classrooms and what supports teachers in delivering effective RE.

### National Curriculum Council and SCAA (1990-1997)

Wintersgill's influence on national RE policy began in earnest when she was appointed Professional Officer for Religious Education at the National Curriculum Council (NCC) in 1990. This was a pivotal moment for RE in England, as the Education Reform Act 1988 had established the National Curriculum but had explicitly excluded RE from its statutory requirements, instead requiring that RE be taught in all maintained schools according to locally agreed syllabuses. Wintersgill played a key role in developing the non-statutory guidance that accompanied this framework, helping to establish what high-quality RE might look like within a decentralised system.

When the NCC was replaced by the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority (SCAA) in 1993, Wintersgill continued in her role as Professional Officer for RE until 1997. During this period, she was instrumental in developing the first Model Syllabuses for Religious Education, published in 1994. These model syllabuses were significant because they provided a template that Local Education Authorities (LEAs) could adapt when drafting their own agreed syllabuses. The model syllabuses emphasised the systematic study of religious traditions, particularly Christianity alongside other principal religions, and established the principle that pupils should encounter religions in depth rather than through superficial overviews.

### Her Majesty's Inspector (HMI) for RE (1997-2006)

Perhaps the most influential phase of Wintersgill's career was her nine-year tenure as Her Majesty's Inspector (HMI) and Specialist Adviser in RE for Ofsted, the Office for Standards in Education. As an HMI, Wintersgill had a national remit to inspect RE across all phases of education, from primary schools through to sixth forms. This role gave her an unparalleled overview of the state of RE in England, allowing her to observe patterns of strength and weakness across thousands of schools.

Her inspection experience profoundly shaped her understanding of what makes RE effective—or ineffective. She observed that even in schools where RE was well-intentioned, there was often a lack of clarity about what pupils were meant to learn and why. Teachers might engage pupils in interesting activities, but without a coherent curriculum framework, these activities failed to build progressively towards genuine understanding. Wintersgill also noted the persistent issue of RE being marginalised in school timetables, particularly at Key Stage 4, where non-examination RE often received minimal time and attention.

During her time as HMI, Wintersgill contributed to several influential Ofsted publications on RE. She was particularly concerned about the variability of RE quality, noting that while some schools offered rich, challenging curricula, many more delivered superficial, fragmented experiences that failed to develop pupils' understanding of religious and non-religious worldviews in any depth.

### Academic and Consultancy Work (2006-Present)

Following her retirement from Ofsted, Wintersgill has maintained an active role in RE policy and practice through academic affiliations and consultancy work. She is an Associate Fellow of the Graduate School of Education at the University of Exeter and an Honorary Fellow of Warwick University, where she is associated with the Warwick Religions and Education Research Unit (WRERU). These academic connections have allowed her to engage with current research in religious education while continuing to influence policy and practice.

In 2016, Wintersgill launched the Big Ideas for Religious Education project, which represents the culmination of her career's work. Drawing on her experience as a teacher, curriculum developer, and national inspector, she set out to create a curriculum framework that would address the fundamental question: what is most important for pupils to learn in RE? The project has been developed in collaboration with other leading RE academics and practitioners, including Professor Denise Cush of Bath Spa University and Dave Francis of REsource (Solarity), and has gained significant traction in the RE community.

## The Big Ideas Framework: Theoretical Foundations

### Origins and Influences

The Big Ideas for Religious Education framework draws on educational theory about the nature of powerful knowledge and how curricula should be structured to promote deep, transferable understanding. Wintersgill was particularly influenced by the work of Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe on "Understanding by Design," which emphasises that curriculum planning should begin with identifying the enduring understandings students should acquire—the "big ideas" that remain relevant long after specific facts are forgotten.

Wintersgill was also influenced by the Science Big Ideas project led by Wynne Harlen, which sought to identify the core concepts that should organise science education. Harlen's work demonstrated that big ideas could provide coherence across a subject, helping teachers and students see connections between topics that might otherwise appear disconnected. Wintersgill saw the potential for a similar approach in RE, where pupils often experience a fragmented curriculum of disconnected topics—one term on Christianity, another on Hinduism, another on ethical issues—without developing an understanding of how these topics relate to each other or to broader questions about religion and worldviews.

The timing of the Big Ideas project was significant. Launched in 2016, it coincided with growing concerns about the future of RE in English schools. Ofsted reports had consistently highlighted concerns about RE quality, and the subject faced increasing marginalisation in an educational landscape dominated by performance tables focused on English Baccalaureate subjects. The 2018 Commission on Religious Education, established by the Religious Education Council of England and Wales, would ultimately recommend a reconceptualisation of the subject as "Religion and Worldviews"—a shift that Wintersgill's Big Ideas framework was well-positioned to support.

### Defining "Big Ideas"

For Wintersgill, big ideas are not simply large topics or broad themes. They are concepts that:

- Provide contexts for understanding essential content in the subject
- Help prioritise subject knowledge by identifying what is most important
- Help make sense of a mass of information by providing organising structures
- Are memorable and transferable to events and experiences outside the classroom
- Require substantial elaboration—a paragraph or more to explain adequately
- Have enduring relevance across different times and contexts

Crucially, Wintersgill emphasises that big ideas are not the same as concepts found within individual religious traditions. While concepts like "karma" or "incarnation" might be important within particular religions, the Big Ideas for RE are meant to be meta-concepts that apply across religions and non-religious worldviews, providing lenses through which to understand the diversity of human religious experience.

This distinction is important for understanding Wintersgill's vision of RE. She is not proposing a thematic approach that strips content of its particularity, nor is she suggesting that pupils should study abstract concepts divorced from specific religious and non-religious traditions. Rather, the Big Ideas provide a framework for organising the encounter with specific traditions, ensuring that pupils develop not just knowledge of isolated facts but understanding of how these facts connect to broader patterns in human religious and worldview experience.

### The Six Big Ideas

The framework identifies six Big Ideas that Wintersgill and her collaborators argue should organise the RE curriculum:

#### Big Idea 1: Continuity, Change and Diversity

This big idea addresses the nature of religions and worldviews as dynamic, diverse phenomena. Wintersgill emphasises that religions involve interconnected patterns of beliefs, practices, and values, but these patterns are not static. They change in response to new situations and challenges, and they manifest in highly diverse forms even within what might appear to be a single tradition.

Understanding continuity, change, and diversity helps pupils avoid simplistic assumptions about religious traditions. Rather than viewing Christianity, Islam, or Hinduism as monolithic entities with fixed characteristics, pupils learn to recognise internal diversity and historical development. They understand that the Christianity of medieval England differs from contemporary Pentecostalism in Brazil, and that both are expressions of a tradition that maintains certain continuities while undergoing significant change.

This big idea also prepares pupils to understand debates and tensions within and between religious communities. Issues like women's ordination, LGBTQ+ inclusion, or responses to modernity can be understood not as aberrations but as manifestations of the ongoing processes of continuity and change that characterise all living traditions.

#### Big Idea 2: Words and Beyond

This big idea addresses how people express and communicate their deepest beliefs, feelings, and religious experiences. Wintersgill notes that such experiences often resist expression through everyday language, leading people to use a variety of approaches including figurative language, literary genres, and non-verbal forms of communication such as art, music, drama, and dance.

The "Words and Beyond" big idea is crucial for helping pupils engage with religious texts and artefacts with appropriate sophistication. Rather than approaching sacred texts as straightforward historical documents or simple instruction manuals, pupils learn to recognise the use of poetry, parable, myth, and symbolism. They understand why a Muslim calligrapher might spend hours crafting a single verse of the Qur'an, or why Hindu worship (puja) involves offerings of light, scent, and food rather than purely verbal prayer.

This big idea also addresses the contested nature of religious expression. Wintersgill notes that the use of some non-verbal forms of communication is highly controversial within some religious groups, particularly their use in worship or ritual. Understanding these controversies helps pupils appreciate the internal diversity and debate within religious communities.

#### Big Idea 3: A Good Life

This big idea addresses ethics and morality within religious and non-religious worldviews. Wintersgill emphasises that many people, whether religious or not, strive to live according to what they understand as a good life. Religious and non-religious communities often share understandings about the characteristics and behaviours a good person will seek to achieve, as well as norms about what is or is not acceptable moral behaviour.

The "Good Life" big idea moves beyond simplistic approaches to RE that focus on listing rules or comparing religious moral codes. Instead, it invites pupils to explore how different worldviews construct ethical frameworks, how they relate individual moral development to community norms, and how they handle disagreement about moral questions. Pupils encounter the idea that religious ethics often involves character formation—developing virtues and dispositions—rather than merely following rules.

Wintersgill also notes that there are points of agreement and disagreement over the interpretation and application of moral principles both across and within different religions and worldviews. This prepares pupils to engage with contemporary ethical debates with an appreciation for their complexity and the genuine diversity of moral reasoning.

#### Big Idea 4: Making Sense of Life's Experiences

This big idea addresses religious experience, ritual, and the ways people find meaning in life events. Wintersgill emphasises that many people have deeply felt, meaningful, or transformative experiences that impact upon their religions or worldviews. These experiences might be explicitly "religious" in nature—mystical encounters, moments of conversion, experiences of divine presence—or they might be broader life experiences—birth, death, love, loss, wonder at the natural world—that people interpret through their worldview frameworks.

The "Making Sense of Life's Experiences" big idea helps pupils understand the experiential dimension of religion and worldviews. It explains why rituals surrounding birth, marriage, and death are so important across traditions, and why people might turn to religious communities during times of crisis or transition. It also opens space for considering how non-religious worldviews provide frameworks for interpreting and responding to life's experiences.

This big idea supports the development of empathy and understanding. By exploring how people from different backgrounds make sense of similar experiences—how a Christian, a Muslim, a humanist, and a Buddhist might each respond to death, for example—pupils develop the capacity to recognise shared human experiences while respecting different interpretations and responses.

#### Big Idea 5: Influence, Interaction and Impact

This big idea addresses the relationship between religions/worldviews and their social, cultural, and political contexts. Wintersgill emphasises that religions and worldviews influence and are influenced by society, culture, and politics. They are not private, purely spiritual matters but phenomena that shape and are shaped by the wider world.

The "Influence, Interaction and Impact" big idea is essential for preparing pupils to understand contemporary issues. It provides frameworks for exploring how religious beliefs influence political positions, how cultural contexts shape religious expression, and how religious communities interact with wider society. Pupils might explore, for example, how Christianity has influenced British culture and institutions, how Islam has adapted to different cultural contexts across the world, or how non-religious worldviews have gained prominence in secular European societies.

This big idea also addresses power and conflict. Wintersgill's framework acknowledges that religious influence can be positive or negative, liberating or oppressive. It provides tools for examining how religions have been used to justify violence and discrimination, as well as how they have inspired movements for justice, human rights, and peace.

#### Big Idea 6: The Big Picture

This big idea addresses the comprehensive accounts of reality that religions and worldviews provide. Wintersgill notes that religions and worldviews often attempt to provide comprehensive accounts of the nature of the universe and of humanity—what philosophers sometimes call "grand narratives" or "metanarratives."

The "Big Picture" big idea helps pupils understand that religions and worldviews are not merely collections of practices or ethical codes but comprehensive ways of understanding reality. They answer fundamental questions: Where did the universe come from? What is the nature of human beings? What happens after death? Is there a purpose to existence? Different traditions offer different answers to these questions, and understanding these "big pictures" is essential for making sense of specific beliefs and practices.

This big idea also introduces pupils to the concept of "worldview" itself—an overarching approach to life that includes beliefs, practices, values, and identity. It supports the shift towards a "Religion and Worldviews" approach by providing frameworks for understanding both religious and non-religious comprehensive perspectives.

## Pedagogical Implications and Classroom Practice

### Curriculum Design

Wintersgill's Big Ideas framework has significant implications for how RE curricula are designed and sequenced. Rather than organising the curriculum around discrete topics or traditions studied in isolation, a Big Ideas approach organises learning around these six overarching concepts, ensuring that pupils encounter them repeatedly across different contexts and with increasing sophistication as they progress through school.

The framework provides age-related statements for each Big Idea, showing how understanding might develop from ages 5-7 through to 14-18. For example, Big Idea 1 (Continuity, Change and Diversity) might be introduced to young children through exploring how people within the same religious community might have different precious objects or celebrate in different ways. By ages 7-11, pupils might explore how religions include people who believe different things and practise in different ways, with some continuity and some change over time. By ages 11-14, they examine the connections and differences between religions and the historical and cultural contexts that shape them. By ages 14-18, they engage with scholarly debates about the definition of religion and how it relates to the concept of worldview.

This spiral curriculum structure ensures that pupils revisit core concepts throughout their education, each time with greater depth and in relation to new content. It avoids the "one-shot" approach where pupils might study, say, Hinduism for a term in Year 8 and never return to it, or where they encounter ethical issues without developing frameworks for engaging with them systematically.

### The Question of Content Selection

A persistent challenge in RE has been determining which content to include in a curriculum that cannot possibly cover all religions exhaustively. Wintersgill's framework addresses this by suggesting that content should be selected for its potential to illuminate the Big Ideas. Rather than asking "Which religions should we teach?" the question becomes "Which examples, drawn from which traditions, will best help pupils understand continuity and change, or words and beyond, or the big picture?"

This approach does not mean abandoning systematic study of religious traditions. Wintersgill is clear that the Big Ideas are not a substitute for knowledge of specific religions but a framework for organising that knowledge. The framework can accommodate different decisions about which religions to include, allowing schools to maintain depth in particular traditions while ensuring that the study of those traditions contributes to broader conceptual understanding.

### Assessment

The Big Ideas framework has implications for how learning in RE is assessed. Wintersgill argues that assessment should focus on whether pupils are developing understanding of the Big Ideas and the ability to apply them to new contexts, rather than merely recalling facts about specific religions.

This suggests forms of assessment that require pupils to use their knowledge to address questions or problems. For example, an assessment might present pupils with an unfamiliar religious artefact or text and ask them to interpret it using concepts from the Big Ideas framework. Can they identify continuity and change? Can they recognise how the object uses "words and beyond"? Can they connect it to questions about the "big picture"?

Such assessments are more demanding than simple recall but better reflect the kinds of understanding that RE should be developing. They also have the advantage of being applicable across different religions and worldviews, reducing the risk that assessment drives a fragmented, content-heavy curriculum.

## Connection to the Commission on RE (2018)

### Shared Concerns and Parallel Development

The Big Ideas project and the Commission on Religious Education (CoRE) began independently in 2016, but they shared fundamental concerns about the state of RE in England. Both initiatives recognised that RE faced significant challenges: declining curriculum time, variable quality, lack of status within schools, and confusion about the subject's purpose and content. Both sought to articulate a vision for RE that would secure its place as a rigorous, valuable component of young people's education.

The Commission's 2018 final report, "Religion and Worldviews: The Way Forward," recommended changing the name of the subject to "Religion and Worldviews" and reconceptualising its scope to include non-religious worldviews alongside religious traditions. This shift aligned closely with Wintersgill's Big Ideas framework, which had been designed from the outset to apply across both religious and non-religious perspectives.

### Influence on the National Statement of Entitlement

The Big Ideas framework exercised significant influence on the development of the Religious Education Council's National Statement of Entitlement (NSE). The NSE sets out what all pupils are entitled to learn in RE, and its content statements align closely with Wintersgill's six Big Ideas. This is not coincidental: several members of the Big Ideas project team were involved in the REC's work, and the frameworks developed in parallel with ongoing dialogue between the two initiatives.

The alignment between the Big Ideas and the NSE content statements is particularly evident in their shared emphasis on diversity and change, the various ways worldviews are expressed, ethical living, meaning-making, the interaction between worldviews and society, and the big questions about reality and humanity. Both frameworks also share a commitment to the "worldview" concept as an organising principle that encompasses both religious and non-religious perspectives.

### The Religion and Worldviews Approach

Wintersgill's framework supports the "Religion and Worldviews" approach championed by the Commission on RE in several important ways. First, by using meta-concepts that apply across religious and non-religious perspectives, the Big Ideas provide a structure for incorporating humanist, secular, and other non-religious worldviews without treating them as an afterthought or appendage to the study of religions. Second, by focusing on how worldviews work—how they are formed, expressed, developed, and transmitted—the framework supports the CoRE vision of RE as the study of how humans make meaning rather than merely the study of religious facts.

The Big Ideas framework has been endorsed by the RE Council as consistent with the National Statement of Entitlement, and it continues to influence how curriculum writers interpret and implement the NSE in practice. The project team has collaborated with the REC to develop exemplar materials that show how the Big Ideas can be put into practice within a Religion and Worldviews framework.

## Knowledge-Rich Religious Education

### The Problem of Superficiality

Throughout her career, Wintersgill has been concerned about superficiality in RE. In her 2019 publication "Putting Big Ideas into Practice," she notes that RE often suffers from "shallow learning" where pupils encounter lots of information but develop little genuine understanding. This superficiality manifests in several ways: the "mile-wide, inch-deep" curriculum where pupils briefly touch on many traditions but study none in depth; the confusion of "learning about religions" with learning isolated facts rather than understanding how religions work; and the emphasis on engagement and discussion without the substantive knowledge that makes such engagement meaningful.

Wintersgill argues that these problems stem partly from a lack of clarity about what knowledge in RE actually looks like. Without clear frameworks for identifying the powerful knowledge that pupils should acquire, RE curricula have tended to accumulate content based on availability—what resources happen to exist, what local communities happen to be present—rather than on principled decisions about what will best serve pupils' educational needs.

### The Big Ideas as Powerful Knowledge

The Big Ideas framework addresses this problem by identifying the conceptual knowledge that pupils need in order to make sense of religious and worldview diversity. Wintersgill draws on Michael Young's work on "powerful knowledge"—knowledge that is distinct from common-sense understanding, takes systematic enquiry to acquire, and enables those who possess it to see the world in new ways.

The Big Ideas represent powerful knowledge in this sense. They are not things that pupils would pick up through everyday experience; they require systematic instruction and engagement with academic disciplines including religious studies, theology, philosophy, and the social sciences. And they genuinely transform how pupils see the world: a pupil who understands continuity, change, and diversity will perceive religious traditions differently from someone who assumes each religion is a fixed, monolithic entity.

### Depth Over Breadth

Wintersgill's knowledge-rich approach emphasises depth over breadth. She argues that it is better for pupils to study fewer topics in greater depth, using the Big Ideas to develop genuine understanding, than to cover many topics superficially. This has implications for curriculum planning: schools should be selective about content, choosing examples that will best illuminate the Big Ideas, rather than trying to include everything.

The framework also emphasises the importance of disciplinary knowledge. RE draws on multiple academic disciplines, each with its own methods and concepts. Wintersgill argues that pupils should develop some understanding of how these disciplines work—how a theologian approaches a question differently from an anthropologist, for example—as part of their RE education. This disciplinary understanding is part of what makes RE a genuinely academic subject rather than merely a discussion of personal opinion.

## Ofsted and the Quality of RE

### Inspection Evidence and Patterns

Wintersgill's nine years as HMI for RE gave her an unparalleled view of the patterns of quality in RE across English schools. Her inspection experience revealed persistent issues that the Big Ideas framework was designed to address. She observed that where RE was weakest, it was often because teachers lacked a clear sense of what they were trying to achieve: they had activities, sometimes engaging activities, but no coherent rationale connecting these activities to long-term learning goals.

Conversely, where RE was strongest, it was characterised by clarity of purpose, coherent curriculum sequences, and careful attention to building pupils' conceptual understanding over time. The best RE departments had thought deeply about what pupils should learn and had designed their curricula accordingly, rather than simply following textbooks or accumulating topics.

### The Education Inspection Framework

The Big Ideas framework aligns closely with the principles underlying Ofsted's current Education Inspection Framework (EIF). The EIF emphasises curriculum intent, implementation, and impact—asking schools to be clear about what they intend pupils to learn, how they will teach it, and what difference it makes. The Big Ideas provide a language and framework for articulating curriculum intent in RE, helping schools move beyond vague statements about "tolerance" or "understanding" to specify precisely what knowledge and understanding pupils will acquire.

The framework also supports the EIF's emphasis on curriculum coherence and progression. By providing age-related statements for each Big Idea, Wintersgill's framework helps schools ensure that their curricula build systematically over time, with clear progression from year to year. This addresses one of the most common weaknesses identified in Ofsted RE inspections: the lack of clear progression, where pupils in Year 11 might be covering similar content to pupils in Year 7, just with older pupils.

### Securing RE's Status

A persistent concern for Wintersgill has been the marginalisation of RE, particularly in secondary schools. She argues that part of the problem has been RE's difficulty in articulating its educational value in terms that school leaders recognise. By framing RE around the development of powerful conceptual knowledge—the Big Ideas—the framework provides a rationale for RE that speaks the language of curriculum planning and school improvement.

School leaders who understand the Big Ideas can see why RE deserves curriculum time: not because it is "nice to have" or because of legal requirements, but because it develops essential understanding that pupils need in order to make sense of the diverse, complex world they inhabit. This knowledge-focused rationale can help secure RE's status against the pressures of accountability measures that prioritise other subjects.

## Practical Implementation and Exemplar Materials

### Putting Big Ideas into Practice (2019)

In 2019, Wintersgill, together with Denise Cush and Dave Francis, published "Putting Big Ideas into Practice in Religious Education." This publication translated the theoretical framework into practical guidance for curriculum developers and classroom teachers. It includes detailed programmes of study for ages 5-18, showing how the Big Ideas can be implemented across the compulsory education phase.

The programmes of study follow a spiral curriculum model, with pupils revisiting each Big Idea at regular intervals with increasing sophistication. Each programme includes age-related statements that specify what pupils should know, understand, and be able to do, providing clear learning objectives that can guide teaching and assessment. The programmes also suggest content that might be used to illuminate each Big Idea, though they are careful to note that these are suggestions rather than prescriptions—schools should select content appropriate to their contexts.

### The Big Ideas for RE Website

The Big Ideas project maintains a comprehensive website (bigideasforre.org) that provides free resources for RE teachers and curriculum developers. The site includes the full programmes of study, explanatory materials about each Big Idea, and a growing collection of exemplar units of work that show how the Big Ideas can be put into practice in the classroom.

The website represents Wintersgill's commitment to making the framework accessible and usable by practising teachers. Recognising that curriculum frameworks are only valuable if they can be implemented, the project team has invested considerable effort in creating practical resources that support teachers in translating the Big Ideas into lesson sequences and classroom activities.

### Collaboration with Solarity and RE:ONLINE

Wintersgill has collaborated with Solarity (formerly REsource) and RE:ONLINE to develop and disseminate Big Ideas materials. These partnerships have helped extend the reach of the framework and ensure that it is integrated with other developments in RE pedagogy. The Big Ideas GCSE resources developed through these collaborations show how the framework can be applied even within the constraints of examination specifications, demonstrating that big ideas thinking is compatible with current accountability structures.

## Criticisms and Debates

### The Question of Secular Worldviews

While the Big Ideas framework has been praised for its inclusivity, some critics have questioned whether it adequately addresses the specific character of non-religious worldviews. Humanists and other non-religious groups have sometimes argued that the framework, developed primarily by people with backgrounds in religious studies and theology, still treats religious perspectives as the norm and non-religious perspectives as deviations from that norm.

Wintersgill and her collaborators have responded to these concerns by emphasising that the Big Ideas are genuinely neutral with respect to religious and non-religious perspectives. Big Idea 6 (The Big Picture), for example, applies equally to Christian theology and to secular humanist naturalism—both provide comprehensive accounts of reality, answer questions about meaning and purpose (or lack thereof), and shape how adherents understand their place in the universe. Nevertheless, the debate about how to represent non-religious perspectives fairly remains an active one in RE.

### Thematic versus Systematic Study

Another debate concerns the relationship between the Big Ideas approach and systematic study of religious traditions. Some RE practitioners have expressed concern that a Big Ideas framework might lead to fragmented, thematic teaching that prevents pupils from developing deep knowledge of any particular tradition. If pupils study Christianity one week and Buddhism the next, each through the lens of a different Big Idea, will they ever develop coherent understanding of either tradition?

Wintersgill's response is that the Big Ideas are not a substitute for systematic study but a framework for organising it. Schools can—and should—study particular traditions in depth, using the Big Ideas to ensure that this study builds conceptual understanding rather than merely accumulating facts. The programmes of study provide examples of how depth in particular traditions can be combined with big ideas thinking. However, the risk of fragmentation remains if the framework is implemented carelessly.

### Knowledge versus Skills

The Big Ideas framework's emphasis on conceptual knowledge has led some to ask about the place of skills and personal development in RE. Wintersgill has been clear that knowledge is not the only outcome that matters: RE should also develop pupils' capacities for interpretation, evaluation, and empathy, and it should contribute to their personal formation. However, she argues that these other outcomes depend on knowledge: pupils cannot interpret religious texts skilfully without understanding how religious language works; they cannot evaluate ethical positions without understanding the frameworks from which those positions emerge.

This knowledge-first approach aligns with broader trends in educational thinking that have emphasised the importance of knowledge-rich curricula. However, some RE practitioners remain concerned that an overemphasis on knowledge might detract from the personal, experiential dimensions of RE that have traditionally been valued in the subject.

## Legacy and Continuing Influence

### Impact on National Policy

Barbara Wintersgill's influence on RE in England extends across multiple decades and multiple domains. As Professional Officer at NCC and SCAA, she shaped the model syllabuses that influenced RE for a generation. As HMI, she established standards and identified patterns of quality that informed inspection practice. As developer of the Big Ideas framework, she has provided a curriculum structure that has influenced the National Statement of Entitlement and the work of the Commission on RE.

This cumulative influence makes Wintersgill one of the most significant figures in the recent history of English RE. Few individuals have had such sustained impact across policy, inspection, and curriculum development. Her work has helped to professionalise RE, establishing it as a subject with identifiable disciplinary foundations and clear educational purposes.

### Support for Teachers and Curriculum Developers

Beyond policy influence, Wintersgill's legacy includes the practical support she has provided to RE teachers and curriculum developers. The Big Ideas framework offers a language and structure that helps teachers articulate what they are trying to achieve and evaluate whether they are achieving it. For curriculum developers, the framework provides principles for selecting content and sequencing learning that can inform decisions about locally agreed syllabuses and academy curricula.

The free resources provided through the Big Ideas for RE website represent a significant contribution to the RE community, particularly given the limited funding often available for RE professional development. By making high-quality curriculum thinking freely available, Wintersgill has supported the improvement of RE in schools that might not otherwise have access to such expertise.

### The Future of the Big Ideas

The Big Ideas framework continues to evolve. The project team regularly reviews and refines the age-related statements based on feedback from classroom use and ongoing scholarly developments in religious studies and education. As the Religion and Worldviews approach becomes more established, the relationship between the Big Ideas and the National Statement of Entitlement continues to develop, with potential for closer alignment and mutual reinforcement.

Wintersgill's work has also influenced RE developments beyond England. The Big Ideas approach has attracted interest from RE educators in other countries facing similar challenges about curriculum coherence and the relationship between religious and non-religious perspectives. While the framework was developed specifically for the English context, its underlying principles have broader applicability.

## Conclusion

Barbara Wintersgill's contribution to religious education in England represents a sustained attempt to establish RE as a rigorous, knowledge-rich subject with clear educational purposes. From her early work on the Model Syllabuses through her inspection career to the development of the Big Ideas framework, she has consistently sought to clarify what pupils should learn in RE and why it matters.

The Big Ideas for Religious Education provides a coherent curriculum framework that addresses many of the challenges facing RE: fragmentation, superficiality, marginalisation, and confusion about the subject's identity. By identifying six overarching concepts that apply across religious and non-religious worldviews, Wintersgill has given RE a structure that supports depth, progression, and coherence while remaining flexible enough to accommodate different contexts and content decisions.

The framework's influence on the Commission on RE and the National Statement of Entitlement ensures that Wintersgill's ideas will shape RE in England for years to come. As schools and syllabus bodies work to implement the Religion and Worldviews approach, the Big Ideas provide a proven structure for translating high-level policy into classroom practice. For RE teachers seeking to deliver educationally rigorous, conceptually rich RE, Wintersgill's work offers both theoretical foundations and practical guidance.

In an educational landscape where RE often struggles for recognition and resources, Wintersgill's career demonstrates the difference that informed, persistent advocacy can make. Her work shows that RE can be intellectually demanding, educationally valuable, and rigorously assessed—qualities that are essential if the subject is to secure its place in the curriculum and serve young people well in their understanding of religion and worldviews.
