## Professional Background and Role

### RE Today Services

Blaylock joined RE Today Services (formerly the Christian Education Movement) following a degree in biblical studies and philosophy. The organisation traces its origins to Robert Raikes's Sunday-school movement nearly 300 years ago and today operates as a UK educational charity dedicated to:

- Training teachers of RE through courses, conferences and in-school consultancy
- Publishing resources including the termly *REtoday* magazine and specialised teaching materials
- Writing locally agreed syllabuses and curriculum plans for local authorities
- Providing policy recommendations to government on RE matters
- Managing national competitions and projects to raise the profile of RE

As National Adviser, Blaylock spends the majority of his time delivering training to teachers across the country, working directly with schools to improve the quality of religious education. He is one of the longest-serving team members at RE Today, with over two decades of continuous service.

### Primary and Secondary Expertise

Uniquely among RE specialists, Blaylock maintains expertise across both primary and secondary phases. This dual specialism enables him to understand the full progression of RE from the Early Years Foundation Stage through to A-Level, ensuring coherence and development in pupils' religious literacy. His training sessions address the specific challenges facing teachers at each key stage while maintaining a consistent vision for what excellent RE looks like.

## Editorial Leadership: REtoday Magazine

### Three Decades of Editorial Direction

For thirty years, Blaylock served as Editor of *REtoday* magazine, the flagship publication for RE teachers in the UK. Under his editorship, the magazine became an essential professional resource, combining:

- **Practical classroom ideas** adaptable for different age groups and contexts
- **Theoretical and pedagogical articles** exploring current debates in RE
- **Resource reviews** evaluating new materials and approaches
- **Policy updates** keeping teachers informed of curriculum changes
- **Case studies** showcasing exemplary practice from schools

### Editorial Philosophy

Blaylock's editorial approach reflects his broader educational philosophy. Articles in *REtoday* consistently emphasise creativity, pupil engagement and the transformative potential of RE. The magazine has championed enquiry-based approaches, the integration of expressive arts, and the importance of helping pupils think for themselves about religious and ethical questions.

In May 2024, Blaylock stepped down as Editor, marking the end of an era for the publication. His final editorial paid tribute to Dr Stephen Orchard, the former Director of Christian Education who first gave him the role as RE Adviser, acknowledging the lineage of leadership that has shaped RE Today.

## Published Resources and Materials

### Picturing Christianity (2013)

One of Blaylock's most distinctive contributions is *Picturing Christianity*, a visual teaching resource pack designed for learning from global Christianity. The resource provides:

- **24 carefully selected images and works of art** drawn from Christian communities across five continents
- **Contemporary global perspectives** showing Christianity as a living, diverse world religion
- **CD-ROM functionality** enabling all pictures to be used in pairs on interactive whiteboards
- **Associated learning activities** that make biblical text and narrative come alive in the classroom
- **A4 picture cards** for hands-on classroom use

The resource exemplifies Blaylock's commitment to visual learning and his recognition that pupils engage deeply with religious content through imagery. By selecting art from Africa, Asia, Latin America and other non-Western contexts, *Picturing Christianity* challenges the Eurocentric presentation of Christianity that dominates much RE teaching.

### Big, Big Questions: Music in RE

Blaylock developed *Big, Big Questions* as a package specifically designed to integrate music into religious education. The resource recognises that:

- Music offers powerful pathways into spiritual and religious experience
- Pupils' own musical preferences can serve as bridges to understanding religious music
- Composing and performing music develops empathy and understanding
- Sound and silence are intrinsic to many religious traditions

This resource demonstrates Blaylock's willingness to cross traditional subject boundaries and use creative arts as vehicles for religious learning.

### Spiritual Engagement: 16-19 RE Days

For post-16 students, Blaylock created *Spiritual Engagement*, a folder of ideas designed for RE days and intensive study periods. This resource addresses the particular challenges of engaging older students with religious and spiritual questions, providing:

- Extended enquiry activities suitable for intensive study
- Materials addressing existential and philosophical questions
- Approaches that respect the maturity and scepticism of sixth-form students
- Connections between academic study and personal spiritual development

### Examining Religion and Belief Series

Blaylock co-edited (with Angela Hill) the *Examining Religion and Belief* series, a compilation of over 40 real-life examples of pupils' achievement in RE. Designed to give teachers and leaders concrete illustrations of what progression looks like, the resource demonstrates:

- The range of achievement possible in RE across different key stages
- How pupils develop religious literacy over time
- Exemplar work that teachers can use for assessment standardisation
- Evidence of the depth of thinking of which pupils are capable

### Understanding Christianity

Blaylock was one of the writers of *Understanding Christianity*, a major resource first published in 2016 that is now used in approximately 7,000 schools (over a quarter of all schools in England). The resource provides a comprehensive approach to teaching Christianity from ages 4 to 14, organised around seven core concepts:

1. **God** – Understanding the nature and character of God
2. **Creation** – Exploring beliefs about the origins and purpose of the universe
3. **Fall** – Understanding the concept of human separation from God
4. **People of God** – Learning about the biblical narrative of God's relationship with humanity
5. **Incarnation** – Exploring Christian beliefs about Jesus as God made human
6. **Gospel** – Understanding the meaning of 'good news' in Christian faith
7. **Salvation** – Exploring beliefs about how humans are saved or reconciled with God
8. **Kingdom of God** – Understanding Christian hope and eschatology

The Church of England's over 4,400 schools have been particularly enthusiastic adopters, but the resource is used across the maintained sector. Blaylock's contribution ensured that the materials maintained both theological integrity and pedagogical accessibility.

### Anti-Racist Religious Education

More recently, Blaylock has led the Anti-Racist RE project, generously supported by the Free Churches Group and Methodist Schools. This initiative addresses:

- Representation and diversity within RE curriculum content
- Challenging stereotypes about religious communities
- Inclusive pedagogies that value all pupils' backgrounds
- Critical examination of how religion has been used to justify racism
- Developing RE as a subject that promotes social cohesion and challenges prejudice

## The Spirited Arts Competition

### Origins and Purpose

Since 2004, Blaylock has led the annual Spirited Arts competition, NATRE's flagship creative RE project. The competition invites pupils to express their imaginative ideas about faith, prayer, God, doubt and spiritual questions through art, poetry, photography and other creative media. With approximately three-quarters of a million young people participating over the years, it represents one of the largest creative education projects in the UK.

### Competition Categories

Spirited Arts typically includes multiple categories that change annually but consistently include:

- **Art and design** – Visual responses to spiritual themes
- **Poetry and creative writing** – Written expressions of spiritual reflection
- **Photography** – Capturing spiritual moments and symbols
- **Video and digital media** – Contemporary creative responses

### Educational Impact

Blaylock describes Spirited Arts as his "favourite thing" and the competition has opened "an extraordinary stream of spirituality among young people." The entries demonstrate that:

- Young people are doing vital thinking about beliefs and values through their RE
- Creative expression enables pupils to articulate spiritual insights they might struggle to express verbally
- Art provides a legitimate and valued pathway to religious understanding
- Pupils are eager to challenge ideas around religion and ethics through creative means

The competition has been endorsed by numerous organisations and is integrated into the RE curriculum of many schools as a "Spirited Arts unit" or dedicated RE/arts week.

## Pedagogical Approach: Enquiry-Based RE

### Core Principles

Blaylock's pedagogical philosophy centres on enquiry-based learning (EBL), an approach that positions pupils as active investigators rather than passive recipients of information. In RE, this means:

- **Starting with questions** rather than answers
- **Encouraging pupils to explore** religious and ethical issues through investigation
- **Supporting evidence-based reasoning** about religious claims and practices
- **Developing pupil voice** and respecting children's own perspectives
- **Making space for doubt and uncertainty** as legitimate elements of religious understanding

### Multidisciplinary Approaches

A distinctive feature of Blaylock's approach is the use of multiple disciplinary lenses to study religion. He encourages teachers to draw upon:

- **Textual study** – Close reading of sacred texts and religious writings
- **Theology** – Understanding religious beliefs from an insider perspective
- **Philosophy** – Critical examination of religious claims using philosophical tools
- **Sociology of religion** – Examining how religion functions in social contexts
- **Expressive arts** – Engaging with religion through creative and aesthetic means
- **Ninian Smart's seven dimensions** – Using Smart's framework (doctrinal, mythological, ethical, ritual, experiential, social, material) to ensure comprehensive study

Blaylock has observed that 11-year-olds can adeptly handle these multidisciplinary approaches, saying things like: "Well, if you look at the question of God philosophically, then... but a theological lens shows you that..."

### Depth Over Breadth

A recurring theme in Blaylock's guidance is the value of depth over breadth. His advice to teachers—"do less, but do it better"—challenges the temptation to cover many religions superficially. He advocates:

- Studying three religions (and worldviews such as "spiritual but not religious" or "agnostic") in depth rather than many religions superficially
- Focusing on the "lived faith" of local religious communities
- Using local agreed syllabuses that require study of religions in the local area
- Prioritising deep understanding over factual recall

This approach is particularly relevant in contexts like Leicester, where Blaylock has lived for four decades, with its rich religious diversity providing authentic local resources for RE.

### Creativity and Transformation

Blaylock locates himself on the "holistic and transformative end" of the RE debate. While he affirms the importance of academic rigour, he insists that the best RE "also holds out the possibility of transformation in spiritual, intellectual and personal ways." This philosophy manifests in:

- **Creative pedagogies** that engage pupils' imaginations
- **Personal connection** between pupils and the material they study
- **Spiritual development** as a legitimate aim of RE alongside knowledge acquisition
- **Pupil agency** in constructing their own understandings

## Training and Professional Development

### National Reach

Blaylock's training work takes him across the country, working with:

- Individual schools seeking to improve their RE provision
- Local Authority SACREs (Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education)
- Initial teacher training providers
- Multi-academy trusts developing their RE curriculum
- Subject associations and professional networks

### Typical Training Themes

His training sessions consistently address:

- **Implementing enquiry-based RE** in classroom practice
- **Using creative and visual resources** effectively
- **Assessment in RE** – what progression looks like and how to recognise it
- **Meeting statutory requirements** while maintaining engaging pedagogy
- **Managing controversial issues** in the RE classroom
- **Supporting non-specialist teachers** of RE

### Syllabus Writing

Blaylock has written numerous locally agreed syllabuses for SACREs across England. This work requires balancing:

- National legal requirements for RE
- Local religious demography and community contexts
- National curriculum expectations for religious literacy
- The need for flexibility to accommodate different school types
- Professional consensus about what constitutes high-quality RE

## Key Philosophical Positions

### On the Nature of RE

Blaylock articulates a vision of RE in which "every pupil is on the road, on their own spiritual quest." He sees the subject as having the potential to "drop some profound little packets of learning into young minds" week by week. This view insists that:

- RE is relevant to all pupils, not just those from religious backgrounds
- The subject has both educational and existential value
- Spiritual development is a legitimate educational aim
- RE should help pupils think for themselves about ultimate questions

### On Christianity in Schools

Blaylock has been vocal in challenging what he calls the "myth that children don't learn much about Christianity in school these days." He argues this is "plain rubbish," pointing to:

- The widespread use of Understanding Christianity in over 7,000 schools
- The substantial coverage of Christian belief and ethics in GCSE RS
- The work of Church of England schools with their strong RE provision

However, he acknowledges that the half of students who drop RE at 14 can end up with significant gaps in their knowledge, and advocates for improved provision for all students.

### On Religious Literacy

Blaylock emphasises the development of religious literacy—what he describes as pupils being able to think for themselves using the conceptual tools RE provides. He shares an example of a student's reflection that demonstrates this literacy:

> "It is the beauty of the natural world and the ironic twists of circumstance that affect our everyday lives, as well as the strength I feel I have gained from prayer, that convince me there is some 'Force' controlling our world; but how can we know? On a rational level, are we simply creating a sense of security for ourselves?"

For Blaylock, this represents success: a pupil thinking independently, using the religious literacy RE has provided, rather than simply reproducing received answers.

### On Legal Obligations

Blaylock has been clear that head teachers who fail to provide RE are breaking the law. He argues that the statutory requirement for every student to have a course of RE should be enforced, and that schools failing to comply "should be called to account."

## Practical Classroom Applications

### Using Visual Resources

Drawing on the approach of *Picturing Christianity*, teachers can:

- **Present images in pairs** to generate comparison and analysis
- **Use global Christian art** to challenge Western-centric assumptions
- **Connect visual art to biblical narrative** for deeper textual engagement
- **Enable pupil interpretation** before providing teacher explanation
- **Create classroom displays** that make religious learning visible

### Enquiry-Based Lesson Structures

Blaylock's enquiry-based approach suggests lesson sequences such as:

1. **Provocation** – An image, story or question that opens the enquiry
2. **Investigation** – Pupils gather information from diverse sources
3. **Interpretation** – Analysis using appropriate disciplinary lenses
4. **Reflection** – Personal response and connection-making
5. **Expression** – Creative or written response that demonstrates learning
6. **Evaluation** – Critical assessment of the enquiry process

### Integrating Creative Arts

Based on Spirited Arts and resources like *Big, Big Questions*, teachers can:

- **Use music to access spiritual experience** – both religious and secular music
- **Enable artistic response** to religious themes and concepts
- **Encourage performance** – drama, poetry reading, movement
- **Create classroom rituals** that embody religious practices respectfully
- **Build in making and creating** as legitimate pathways to understanding

### Managing Sensitive Topics

Blaylock's training addresses how to handle controversial issues in RE:

- **Create safe spaces** for pupils to express and explore different views
- **Model respectful disagreement** between different positions
- **Distinguish between learning about and learning from religion**
- **Enable pupil voice** while maintaining educational direction
- **Connect to pupils' lived experience** of diversity and difference

## Influence and Legacy

### Impact on the Profession

Through three decades of editorial work, extensive publication, and national training, Blaylock has influenced generations of RE teachers. His resources are found in staffrooms across the country, and his training has shaped the practice of thousands of practitioners.

### Contribution to Policy

While noting with characteristic humour that government "mostly ignore" RE Today's recommendations, Blaylock has nonetheless contributed to national policy discussions. His work on Understanding Christianity has shaped how a quarter of English schools teach about Christianity, and his syllabus writing has influenced local provision across the country.

### Moving to Part-Time Work

In 2024, Blaylock moved to part-time work, reflecting on his career with gratitude. His legacy includes not only the resources and publications he has created, but the thousands of teachers he has trained and the countless pupils whose RE experience has been enriched by his vision of creative, transformative religious education.
