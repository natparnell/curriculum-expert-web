# Andrew Wright: Critical Realism and the Pursuit of Truth in Religious Education

## Biography and Academic Background

### Early Career and Influences

Andrew Wright is Professor of Religious and Theological Education at the UCL Institute of Education, University College London. He has established himself as one of the most influential philosophers of religious education in the United Kingdom over the past three decades. His work represents a sustained and rigorous engagement with fundamental questions about the nature, purpose, and methodology of religious education in pluralistic, multicultural societies.

Wright's intellectual trajectory has been shaped by his early work as a lecturer at King's College London, where he developed his foundational ideas about spirituality and education. His first major publication, *Spirituality and Education* (2000), established him as a significant voice in debates about spiritual development in schools. This was followed by *Religion, Education and Post-Modernity* (2004), which explored the complex relationship between contemporary philosophical trends and religious pedagogy.

### Key Academic Positions

Throughout his career, Wright has held positions that have enabled him to influence both academic discourse and teacher education. At the UCL Institute of Education, he has been instrumental in shaping the training of religious education teachers, ensuring that philosophical rigour underpins pedagogical practice. His work bridges the often-separated domains of academic theology, philosophy of education, and classroom practice.

Wright has been particularly concerned with developing what he terms "religious literacy"—a concept that goes far beyond superficial knowledge of different faiths to encompass deep understanding of how religious traditions make truth claims and how these claims can be critically evaluated. This concern has driven his development of Critical Religious Education (CRE), a pedagogical approach rooted in the philosophy of critical realism.

## The Philosophy of Critical Realism

### Roy Bhaskar and the Critical Realist Tradition

At the heart of Wright's approach to religious education lies critical realism, a philosophical framework developed primarily by Roy Bhaskar (1944–2014). Critical realism emerged as a response to what Bhaskar saw as the limitations of both positivist empiricism and postmodern relativism. It offers a middle path that affirms both the reality of the external world and the socially mediated nature of human knowledge.

Bhaskar's critical realism is built upon a stratified ontology that distinguishes between three domains of reality:

1. **The Empirical**: What we actually experience and observe
2. **The Actual**: What happens in the world, whether observed or not
3. **The Real**: The underlying structures, mechanisms, and generative powers that cause events

This stratification means that reality is not exhausted by what we can observe. Scientific knowledge, for Bhaskar, involves not merely cataloguing regularities but identifying the causal mechanisms that operate at deeper levels of reality. These mechanisms may not always be apparent in observable events because they interact with other mechanisms in complex, contingent ways.

### Key Tenets of Critical Realism

Critical realism makes several important philosophical moves that distinguish it from both naive realism and radical constructivism:

**Fallibilism**: All knowledge claims are provisional and subject to revision. We can never achieve absolute certainty about our understanding of reality, but this does not mean that all knowledge claims are equally valid.

**Epistemic Relativism**: Our knowledge is always shaped by our social, cultural, and historical contexts. There is no "view from nowhere"—all observation is theory-laden and situated.

**Ontological Realism**: Despite the social mediation of knowledge, reality itself exists independently of our knowledge of it. The world is not merely a social construction; it has its own structure and causal powers.

**Judgemental Rationality**: Even though we cannot achieve certainty, we can nevertheless make rational judgements about which knowledge claims are more or less likely to be true. Evidence, argument, and reason matter.

These principles provide Wright with a philosophical framework that avoids the pitfalls of both modernist absolutism and postmodern relativism. He can affirm that truth claims about religion can be rationally evaluated without claiming that such evaluation yields infallible results.

## Critical Religious Education: Core Principles

### Challenging the Phenomenological Paradigm

Wright's Critical Religious Education (CRE) represents a fundamental challenge to what he sees as the dominant paradigm in British religious education: the phenomenological approach associated with Ninian Smart and developed through the "world religions" paradigm. Wright argues that this approach, while valuable in its insistence on empathetic understanding of diverse traditions, has significant limitations.

The phenomenological approach typically emphasises descriptive understanding—learning *about* religions in a way that suspends judgement about their truth claims. It treats religions as phenomena to be observed and described, much like an anthropologist might study a foreign culture. Wright acknowledges the value of this empathetic dimension but argues that it is insufficient for genuine religious education.

Wright contends that religion is fundamentally concerned with truth claims—claims about the nature of ultimate reality, the purpose of human existence, and how one ought to live. To treat religion purely phenomenologically is to miss its essence. As Wright (2007) argues, religious traditions are not merely cultural artefacts but "communities of inquiry" engaged in the pursuit of truth about fundamental questions.

### The Four Domains of Religious Understanding

Wright proposes that religious education should address four interconnected domains:

#### 1. Experiential Knowledge

This involves understanding the lived experience of religious practitioners—how religious beliefs shape individual and communal life. It includes the phenomenological dimension of empathetic understanding but goes further to recognise that religious experience is itself a form of knowledge claim. When a person reports a mystical experience or a sense of divine presence, they are making a claim about reality, not merely describing their psychological state.

#### 2. Propositional Knowledge

This concerns the doctrinal content of religious traditions—the beliefs, teachings, and truth claims that religions make about the world. Wright insists that propositional knowledge is central to religion. Religions are not merely ways of life or cultural practices; they are systems of belief that make specific claims about what is true. Religious education must take these truth claims seriously and help students understand them.

#### 3. Procedural Knowledge

This involves understanding how religious knowledge is acquired, justified, and transmitted within different traditions. Different religions have different epistemologies—different ways of knowing and validating claims. Some emphasise scripture and revelation; others emphasise reason and natural theology; still others emphasise mystical experience or community tradition. Understanding these procedural differences is crucial for evaluating religious claims.

#### 4. Attitudinal Knowledge

This concerns the dispositions, values, and orientations that shape religious engagement with the world. It includes understanding how religious commitments shape moral reasoning, political engagement, and responses to suffering and injustice. Wright emphasises that religious attitudes are not merely subjective preferences but are grounded in beliefs about what is real and valuable.

### The Pedagogy of Critical Engagement

Critical Religious Education does not seek to indoctrinate students into any particular religious viewpoint. Rather, it aims to develop what Wright calls "religious literacy"—the capacity to engage critically with religious truth claims in an informed and intelligent manner. This involves:

**Understanding Internal Coherence**: Students learn to appreciate how religious beliefs form integrated systems where particular doctrines support and are supported by other elements of the tradition. This involves understanding the "grammar" of religious discourse—how terms function within particular religious contexts.

**Examining External Correspondence**: Students learn to evaluate whether religious claims correspond to reality as we understand it. This involves bringing religious claims into dialogue with other forms of knowledge—scientific, historical, philosophical, and experiential.

**Recognising Perspective**: Students develop awareness of how their own perspectives shape their understanding of religion. This includes recognising their own assumptions, biases, and cultural locatedness.

**Practising Judgemental Rationality**: Ultimately, Wright argues that religious education should enable students to make reasoned judgements about religious truth claims. This does not mean forcing students to adopt particular positions but rather equipping them with the intellectual tools to evaluate claims for themselves.

## Critique of Relativism in Religious Education

### The Problem of "Equal Validity"

One of Wright's most significant contributions to religious education discourse has been his sustained critique of relativism. He identifies a pervasive assumption in contemporary religious education that all religious beliefs are "equally valid" or that truth in religion is purely subjective. This assumption, he argues, undermines the very possibility of genuine religious education.

The "equal validity" assumption typically manifests in several ways:

**Pluralistic Indifference**: The idea that it does not matter what one believes as long as one believes something sincerely. All paths lead to the same destination; religious differences are merely superficial variations on a common theme.

**Expressivist Reductionism**: The view that religious beliefs are not really claims about reality but expressions of psychological states—comfort, hope, identity, or community belonging. On this view, asking whether religious claims are true is a category mistake.

**Epistemological Agnosticism**: The suspension of judgement about religious truth claims on the grounds that such matters are inherently mysterious or beyond human knowledge.

Wright argues that each of these positions fails to take religion seriously on its own terms. Religious traditions themselves typically make exclusivist or at least strongly preferential truth claims. To treat these claims as merely subjective expressions is to misrepresent the nature of religion.

### Multiculturalism and Truth Claims

Wright's critique becomes particularly significant in the context of multicultural education. The concern to respect cultural and religious diversity has sometimes led to a kind of paralysis where teachers feel unable to engage critically with religious beliefs for fear of giving offence or appearing culturally insensitive.

Wright argues that this approach is actually *disrespectful* to religious traditions. To treat religious believers as incapable of engaging with criticism or defending their beliefs through reasoned argument is to treat them as less than fully rational agents. Genuine respect, Wright contends, involves taking people's beliefs seriously enough to engage with them critically.

Moreover, Wright argues that the multicultural concern for respecting diversity can be served better by critical engagement than by uncritical celebration. A truly multicultural education should enable students to understand the genuine differences between traditions—including differences that cannot be easily reconciled. This requires acknowledging that some beliefs are incompatible with others and that not all claims can be simultaneously true.

### The Pursuit of Truth

The title of Wright's major work—*Critical Religious Education, Multiculturalism and the Pursuit of Truth* (2007)—signals his central concern. He argues that religious education should be oriented towards truth in several senses:

**Truthfulness to the Subject Matter**: Religious education should accurately represent what religions actually believe, not sanitised or diluted versions designed to avoid controversy. This includes representing the challenging, distinctive, and sometimes offensive elements of religious traditions.

**Truthfulness in Intellectual Engagement**: Students should be encouraged to seek truth through reasoned inquiry. This involves developing the intellectual virtues—curiosity, intellectual courage, open-mindedness, and rigour—that enable genuine learning.

**Truthfulness in Personal Response**: Students should be enabled to form their own considered views about religious questions, based on genuine engagement with evidence and argument rather than merely conforming to social expectations or uncritically accepting whatever they have been taught.

## Spirituality and Religious Education

### Critique of "Spiritual Education"

In his earlier work on spirituality, Wright developed a critical perspective on the concept of "spiritual education" that has become increasingly prominent in British education policy. The 1944 Education Act's requirement for schools to contribute to pupils' "spiritual development" has been interpreted in various ways, and Wright has been concerned to distinguish legitimate from problematic approaches.

Wright identifies a tendency to treat spirituality as something distinct from, and often opposed to, religion. On this view, spirituality is a universal human capacity for awe, wonder, and transcendence, while religion is a particular cultural expression that may or may not nurture authentic spirituality. This leads to approaches that seek to educate children's spirituality while bracketing or even opposing religious content.

Wright critiques this approach on several grounds:

**The Ambiguity of "Spirituality"**: The term "spirituality" is notoriously vague and contested. Without clear definition, appeals to spirituality can mean almost anything, rendering the concept educationally useless.

**The Historical Connection**: The concepts of "spirit" and "spirituality" have their origins in specific religious traditions—particularly Christianity. To use these terms while denying their religious roots involves a kind of conceptual theft.

**The Risk of Therapeutic Reduction**: Approaches that treat spirituality primarily in terms of personal wellbeing or emotional satisfaction reduce profound questions of meaning and truth to psychological states.

### Towards a Critical Spiritual Education

Wright proposes an alternative: a "critical spiritual education" that takes truth claims seriously. On this view, spirituality is not a realm separate from religion but is intimately connected to questions of what is ultimately real and valuable. Spiritual development involves not merely feeling good or experiencing wonder but developing one's capacity to discern and respond to truth.

This critical approach to spirituality has several implications for classroom practice:

**Connection to Content**: Spiritual development should be connected to engagement with substantive content—religious traditions, philosophical questions, ethical challenges—not treated as a free-floating capacity that can be developed through generic exercises.

**Critical Reflection**: Students should be encouraged to reflect critically on their spiritual experiences and assumptions, not merely to have more of them. This includes questioning whether particular experiences genuinely reveal truth or merely reflect cultural conditioning or psychological need.

**Ethical Dimension**: Spirituality is not merely about individual experience but about how one relates to others and to the world. Critical spiritual education addresses questions of justice, compassion, and responsibility.

## Christianity and Critical Realism

### Theological Application

In his later work, Wright has extended his critical realist framework to engage specifically with Christian theology. His book *Christianity and Critical Realism: Ambiguity, Truth and Theological Literacy* (2013) applies the critical realist framework to questions of Christian doctrine, scripture, and practice.

Wright argues that Christianity makes specific ontological claims—claims about what exists and what is ultimately real. These include claims about the nature of God as Trinity, the person and work of Jesus Christ, and the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. These claims are not merely symbolic or expressive but are intended as descriptions of reality.

However, Wright also acknowledges the complexity of Christian truth claims. Christianity is not a static set of propositions but a living tradition that has developed through history, engaging with different cultures and contexts. This means that Christian doctrine is marked by what Wright calls "ambiguity"—it is always subject to reinterpretation and development while nevertheless claiming to address enduring truths.

### Scriptural Interpretation

Wright applies critical realism to questions of biblical interpretation. He rejects both fundamentalist approaches that treat scripture as straightforwardly perspicuous and postmodern approaches that treat all interpretation as merely subjective construction.

Instead, Wright proposes a critical realist hermeneutic that recognises:

**The Text as Reality**: The biblical texts are real historical artefacts with their own structures, genres, and contexts of production. Understanding these texts requires attention to their actual characteristics, not merely projection of contemporary concerns.

**The Stratification of Meaning**: Scriptural meaning operates at multiple levels—literal, theological, spiritual. Critical interpretation involves attending to these different levels and their relationships.

**The Social Mediation of Interpretation**: All interpretation is shaped by the interpreter's social location, community tradition, and presuppositions. Recognising this does not mean abandoning the quest for understanding but rather engaging in critical self-reflection about one's interpretive stance.

**The Possibility of Truth**: Despite the challenges of interpretation, Wright maintains that the scriptures make truth claims that can be rationally evaluated. The goal of theological education is to develop what Wright calls "theological literacy"—the capacity to engage with Christian truth claims in an informed and critical manner.

## Pedagogical Implications for the Classroom

### Teaching Strategies

Critical Religious Education has significant implications for how teachers approach the classroom. Wright's framework suggests several key strategies:

**Philosophical Enquiry**: RE lessons should include space for genuine philosophical questioning. This involves not merely transmitting information about religions but engaging students in inquiry about fundamental questions—Why is there something rather than nothing? What happens when we die? How do we know what is right?

**Critical Dialogue**: Students should be encouraged to engage in dialogue about religious questions, articulating their own views and responding to the views of others. This requires creating classroom environments where disagreement is treated as a normal part of intellectual engagement rather than something to be avoided.

**Conceptual Precision**: Teachers should help students develop precision in their use of religious and philosophical concepts. This includes understanding how terms function differently in different contexts and recognising when apparent disagreements are actually verbal disputes.

**Epistemic Humility**: While Wright rejects relativism, he also insists on the importance of intellectual humility. Students should learn to hold their beliefs with appropriate tentativeness, recognising the limitations of human knowledge and the possibility of error.

### Assessment and Progression

Critical Religious Education has implications for how we assess student learning and conceptualise progression in RE:

**Beyond Factual Recall**: Assessment should go beyond testing students' recall of factual information about religions. It should evaluate students' capacity to engage critically with religious ideas, to evaluate arguments, and to articulate their own reasoned positions.

**Progression in Complexity**: Progression in RE should be understood in terms of increasing sophistication in handling complexity. More advanced students should be able to engage with more difficult questions, recognise more subtle distinctions, and hold more nuanced positions.

**Authentic Engagement**: Assessment should seek evidence of authentic engagement with religious questions, not merely performance of expected answers. This means creating assessment opportunities where students can express their own thinking.

### Teacher Knowledge and Development

Wright's approach places significant demands on RE teachers. To implement Critical Religious Education effectively, teachers need:

**Philosophical Competence**: Teachers need understanding of philosophical concepts and methods, including familiarity with epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics. Without this philosophical grounding, teachers cannot guide students in critical inquiry.

**Deep Subject Knowledge**: Teachers need deep knowledge of the religious traditions they teach. This includes not merely surface familiarity but understanding of the internal logic of traditions and the reasons why adherents hold their beliefs.

**Pedagogical Skill**: Teachers need skill in facilitating philosophical discussion, managing disagreement, and guiding inquiry without imposing their own views. This is challenging pedagogy that requires significant professional development.

**Critical Self-Awareness**: Teachers need awareness of their own beliefs, biases, and assumptions. This self-awareness is necessary to avoid unconsciously imposing particular viewpoints while still maintaining commitment to truth and rationality.

## Critiques and Responses

### Charges of Christian Bias

Wright's work has faced criticism from those who see it as inappropriately privileging Christian theology. Critics point to Wright's background as a Christian theologian and his extensive work on Christian doctrine as evidence that his supposedly neutral framework actually favours Christian assumptions.

Wright has responded to these charges by emphasising the distinction between his philosophical framework and his theological commitments. Critical realism, he argues, is a philosophical position that can be adopted by people of any religious persuasion or none. While Wright himself is a Christian, the framework he proposes is not intrinsically Christian.

Moreover, Wright points out that his framework actually provides tools for critiquing Christian claims as well as affirming them. Critical realism requires that all truth claims—including Christian ones—be subject to rational evaluation. Wright's own work includes significant critical engagement with Christian doctrine, challenging simplistic or uncritical formulations of faith.

### Postmodern Challenges

Postmodern critics have challenged Wright's commitment to truth and rationality as itself a form of ideological imposition. From a postmodern perspective, any claim to have access to truth or to be able to evaluate beliefs rationally is itself a power move that privileges certain voices and marginalises others.

Wright engages seriously with postmodern critiques, acknowledging the force of concerns about power, perspective, and the social construction of knowledge. However, he argues that postmodernism, taken to its logical conclusion, undermines the very possibility of education. If all claims are equally valid or equally invalid, there is nothing to teach and nothing to learn.

Wright's critical realist framework attempts to take postmodern insights seriously while avoiding postmodern nihilism. He accepts that knowledge is socially mediated and that power shapes what counts as knowledge. But he insists that these insights do not entail that truth is merely a social construction. Reality has its own structure, and our task is to seek increasingly adequate understanding of that structure.

### Practical Concerns

Some practitioners have raised practical concerns about Critical Religious Education. In classrooms with diverse student populations, engaging critically with religious truth claims risks causing offence, marginalising minority students, or reinforcing existing power imbalances. Teachers may feel unprepared for the philosophical demands of Wright's approach or concerned about their own beliefs being challenged.

Wright acknowledges these concerns and argues that they point to the need for better teacher education and careful pedagogical design. Critical Religious Education is not a license for teachers to impose their views or to create hostile environments for students. Rather, it requires creating spaces of intellectual safety where genuine inquiry can occur. This involves establishing ground rules for respectful engagement, being attentive to power dynamics, and ensuring that all students have voice in classroom discussions.

## Influence and Legacy

### Academic Impact

Wright's work has had significant influence on academic discourse in religious education. His books are widely cited, and his arguments have shaped debates about the nature and purpose of RE in the UK and beyond. The philosophy of critical realism that Wright has championed has provided a framework for researchers seeking to navigate between positivist and postmodern extremes.

Wright's concept of "religious literacy" has been particularly influential. While the term has been adopted and adapted by various constituencies, often in ways that diverge from Wright's original meaning, its currency in educational discourse testifies to the impact of his work.

### Policy Influence

Wright's influence extends beyond the academy into policy circles. His critiques of prevailing approaches to RE have informed debates about curriculum design and assessment. His insistence on the importance of taking religious truth claims seriously has found echoes in recent policy developments that seek to strengthen the academic rigour of RE.

However, Wright has also been critical of policy developments that he sees as watering down the intellectual demands of RE or reducing it to a form of citizenship education or values transmission. He has been particularly critical of approaches that treat RE primarily as a vehicle for promoting social cohesion or community cohesion, arguing that such instrumentalisation neglects the intrinsic value of religious inquiry.

### Continuing Relevance

In an age of increasing religious pluralism, rising secularism, and renewed public debate about the role of religion in education, Wright's work remains highly relevant. His framework provides resources for addressing questions that continue to trouble religious educators:

- How can we teach about religion in a way that respects diversity without lapsing into relativism?
- How can we engage students with religious truth claims without indoctrinating them?
- How can we develop teachers who are equipped for the philosophical demands of RE?
- How can we assess religious education in ways that go beyond factual recall?

Wright's Critical Religious Education does not provide easy answers to these questions, but it offers a coherent philosophical framework within which they can be addressed with intellectual honesty and pedagogical sophistication.

## Conclusion

Andrew Wright stands as one of the most significant philosophers of religious education in contemporary Britain. His development of Critical Religious Education, grounded in the philosophy of critical realism, offers a sophisticated alternative to both uncritical relativism and dogmatic absolutism. By insisting on the importance of engaging seriously with religious truth claims while maintaining epistemic humility, Wright has provided a framework for religious education that respects both the intellectual integrity of religious traditions and the autonomy of learners.

The challenges Wright identifies—how to teach about religion in a pluralistic society, how to navigate between respect for diversity and commitment to truth, how to develop genuine religious literacy—remain central to religious education. His work continues to provide essential resources for educators, researchers, and policymakers seeking to address these challenges with philosophical rigour and pedagogical wisdom.

For teachers seeking to implement Wright's vision, the task is demanding but rewarding. It requires deep subject knowledge, philosophical competence, and pedagogical skill. But the payoff is an approach to religious education that takes religion seriously, respects learners as rational agents, and contributes to the formation of genuinely religiously literate citizens.
