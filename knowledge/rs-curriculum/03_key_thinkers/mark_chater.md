# Mark Chater: Reforming Religious Education

## Biographical Overview

Dr Mark Chater is one of the most influential figures in contemporary Religious Education (RE) in England, with a career spanning over four decades as a teacher, researcher, policy maker, and charity director. Currently serving as **Professor of Practice in Worldviews Education** at the University of Cumbria, Chater has dedicated his professional life to advancing the quality, rigour, and inclusivity of religious education in schools.

Chater holds a **PhD in theology and education** from the Universities of Edinburgh, providing him with the interdisciplinary foundation that would characterise his later work bridging theological studies, educational theory, and classroom practice. His academic background combines rigorous theological training with deep engagement in educational research and policy development.

## Director of Culham St Gabriel's Trust (2011–2019)

### Founding Leadership

In **2011**, Mark Chater was appointed as the **first Director of Culham St Gabriel's Trust**, a position he held until April 2019. The Trust was formed in 2012 through the merger of two historic church college trusts—Culham Educational Foundation and St Gabriel's Trust—bringing together significant charitable endowments to support religious education nationally.

Chater's reflections on the merger highlight the careful, collaborative process that established the Trust. The idea emerged from discussions between Dr Priscilla Chadwick (then Chair of St Gabriel's) and John Gay, with an Implementation Committee chaired by John Keast overseeing the complex details of bringing together two established organisations with distinct histories and cultures.

### Key Achievements at Culham St Gabriel's

Under Chater's leadership, Culham St Gabriel's Trust became a pivotal force in the RE landscape through three major strategic investments:

#### 1. Understanding Christianity

The Trust provided significant funding for the **Understanding Christianity** resource, a comprehensive programme developed to enhance the rigour and excellence of Christian teaching in RE. This resource, which had what Chater describes as a "long and at times lively gestation," has since become a cornerstone of Christian theological education in schools, providing teachers with high-quality materials grounded in theological literacy rather than superficial religious instruction.

#### 2. NATRE Regional Champions Programme

Culham St Gabriel's funded the **regional champions programme** in partnership with NATRE (National Association of Teachers of RE) and RE Today. This initiative strengthened the infrastructure of support available to RE teachers across England, contributing to the growth and sustainability of NATRE as the primary professional body for RE teachers. The regional champions provided vital local support networks for teachers who often work in isolated contexts within their schools.

#### 3. The Commission on Religious Education (CoRE)

Perhaps Chater's most significant legacy at Culham St Gabriel's was the Trust's pivotal role in establishing and supporting the **Commission on Religious Education**, which submitted its final report in 2018. The Trust provided substantial financial and organisational backing for this independent commission, which Chater believes "changed the conversation about the future of RE."

## The Commission on Religious Education (CoRE) 2018

### Establishment and Purpose

The **Commission on Religious Education** was established by the Religious Education Council of England and Wales (REC) to conduct a comprehensive, evidence-based review of the legal, educational, and policy frameworks for Religious Education. Chater, through his role at Culham St Gabriel's, was instrumental in ensuring the Commission had the resources and independence to undertake this ambitious review.

The Commission operated with **14 commissioners** appointed by the REC, each acting in a personal, independent capacity rather than as representatives of professional or religious/non-religious communities. This independence was crucial to the Commission's credibility and authority.

### The Final Report: "Religion and Worldviews: The Way Forward"

In **September 2018**, the Commission released its landmark final report: **_Religion and Worldviews: The Way Forward. A National Plan for RE_**. The report presented **11 recommendations** calling for fundamental reform of Religious Education in England.

#### Central Recommendation: The "Religion and Worldviews" Paradigm

The Commission's most significant—and most debated—recommendation was the proposed reconceptualisation of the subject from "Religious Education" to **"Religion and Worldviews"** (RWE). This was not merely a name change but a fundamental reframing of the subject's organising concept.

The report argued that:

- The term "Religious Education" no longer accurately described what the subject should encompass
- Education about **non-religious worldviews** (including humanism, secularism, and atheism) should have parity of esteem with religious traditions
- The subject should examine how worldviews shape individuals and societies, going beyond factual learning about religions to engage with how people actually live their beliefs

#### The National Entitlement

The Commission proposed a **National Entitlement** that would guarantee all pupils access to high-quality education about religion and worldviews. This entitlement would:

- Apply to all pupils in all state-funded schools, including faith schools and academies
- Ensure systematic progression from Early Years through to Key Stage 5
- Be guided by a national statement of entitlement rather than locally determined Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education (SACREs)

#### Professional Standards and Teacher Preparation

**Recommendation 6** of the Commission's report focused on teacher preparation, requiring enhanced professional development for primary teachers in RE. This recommendation acknowledged the particular challenges facing primary RE, where non-specialist teachers often lack confidence and training in teaching about religions and worldviews.

### Impact and Legacy of CoRE

The Commission's report generated significant debate within the RE community. As Chater himself noted in his 2022 article "Why RE's Radical Reform Could Fail," the report "changed the conversation about the future of RE"—but implementation has been slow. The then Secretary of State for Education, Damian Hinds, gave an **emphatically negative response** to the recommendations in 2018, stating that policy change would not be forthcoming.

Despite this political setback, the Commission's framing of "Religion and Worldviews" has gained substantial traction in academic and professional discourse. The term has become widely adopted in RE literature, teacher training programmes, and curriculum development—even as statutory change has remained elusive.

## Scholarly Contributions and Publications

### "We Need to Talk About Religious Education" (2018)

Co-edited with Mike Castelli (then Executive Chair of the Association of University Lecturers in RE), this collection of **manifestos for the future of RE** assembled contributions from leading figures across the field. The book's subtitle—_Manifestos for the Future of RE_—captured its purpose: to present diverse visions for how the subject could evolve.

Contributors included:
- **Professor Linda Woodhead** (sociologist of religion)
- **Clive Lawton** (educator and commentator)
- **Peter Schreiner** (European religious education scholar)
- **Dr Richard Kueh** (Ofsted subject lead for RE)
- **Mary Myatt** (education consultant)
- **Dawn Cox** (practitioner and curriculum developer)

The book was praised by Robert Jackson of the American International Journal of Religion and Education as assembling "huge amounts of wisdom and experience," while Grace Davie (Professor Emeritus, University of Exeter) endorsed its central message: "be absolutely clear about the purpose of RE and teach it well."

### "Reforming Religious Education: Power and Knowledge in a Worldviews Curriculum" (2020)

Chater's **2020 monograph** represents his most comprehensive articulation of the case for radical RE reform. The book:

- **Diagnoses** the reasons why RE urgently needs transformation
- **Proposes** a new identity for the subject based on democratic purpose
- **Identifies** how key leaders can drive change
- **Showcases** emerging good practice that exemplifies the new paradigm

The book argues that the current structures of RE—particularly the locally determined system of Agreed Syllabuses administered by SACREs—create what Chater terms **"producer capture,"** where the interests of those managing the system take precedence over the educational needs of pupils. This analysis has been influential in debates about the governance and structure of RE.

### Academic Articles and Policy Papers

Chater has published extensively in peer-reviewed journals including the **British Journal of Educational Studies**, **Journal of Beliefs and Values**, and **Journal of Religious Education**. His articles have addressed:

- The politics of epistemology in RE reform
- The economics of producer capture in curriculum governance
- The conceptual foundations of the "worldviews" approach
- Implementation challenges for the CoRE recommendations

## Theoretical Contributions to RE

### The Worldviews Paradigm

Chater's most significant theoretical contribution has been the development and advocacy of the **"worldviews" approach** to religious education. This paradigm shift involves several key elements:

#### Beyond the "World Religions Paradigm"

Chater has been critical of the traditional "world religions paradigm" that has dominated RE since the 1970s, associated with the work of Ninian Smart. While acknowledging Smart's contribution to establishing RE as an educational rather than confessional subject, Chater argues that this framework:

- Presents religions as discrete, bounded systems
- Fails to account for lived religion and individual belief
- Marginalises non-religious worldviews
- Struggles to engage with religious diversity, syncretism, and change

#### Worldviews as Lived and Diverse

The worldviews approach, by contrast, understands religions and non-religious philosophies as:

- **Dynamic and changing** rather than static
- **Internally diverse** rather than monolithic
- **Practised and embodied** rather than merely doctrinal
- **Shaped by context** including culture, politics, and individual experience

This approach enables RE to engage with questions of identity, meaning, and values in ways that resonate with pupils' own experiences of living in a pluralistic society.

### Critique of Producer Capture

Chater's concept of **"producer capture"** has been particularly influential in policy debates. Drawing on public choice theory, Chater argues that the current governance structures for RE—particularly SACREs and Standing Advisory Councils—have become captured by sectional interests including:

- Religious groups seeking to protect their representation
- Local authorities maintaining control over curriculum decisions
- Professional associations with vested interests in the status quo

This critique has been controversial but has opened important conversations about how RE should be governed in a diverse, democratic society.

## Current Work at the University of Cumbria

Since joining the **University of Cumbria** in 2021, Chater has continued his work on RE reform from an academic base. As Professor of Practice in Worldviews Education, he:

- Supports the development of RE Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes
- Conducts research on worldviews education in schools
- Advises policy makers and curriculum developers
- Maintains his engagement with practitioner communities through speaking and writing

His location in Cumbria reflects both his personal commitment to the region and the University's strategic focus on worldviews education as a distinctive area of expertise.

## Pedagogical Implications for Classroom Practice

### Implications for Curriculum Design

Chater's work has significant implications for how schools design their RE curricula:

#### 1. Balanced Treatment of Worldviews

The worldviews approach requires that curricula give **parity of treatment** to religious and non-religious worldviews. This does not mean equal time for every worldview, but rather that:

- Humanism, secularism, and atheism are studied with the same academic rigour as religious traditions
- Pupils encounter worldviews as lived realities rather than abstract systems
- The curriculum reflects the actual diversity of worldviews in contemporary society

#### 2. Engagement with Lived Religion

Chater advocates for curricula that move beyond "textbook religion" to engage with:

- How actual believers and non-believers live their worldviews
- Diversity within traditions (including dissenting and minority voices)
- The ways worldviews interact, influence each other, and change over time
- The relationship between worldviews and identity, culture, and politics

#### 3. Critical Enquiry

The worldviews approach emphasises **critical enquiry** rather than mere information transmission. Pupils should:

- Investigate how worldviews make truth claims
- Examine the evidence and reasoning behind different positions
- Develop their own reasoned perspectives on questions of meaning and value
- Engage respectfully but critically with views different from their own

### Implications for Pedagogy

Chater's work suggests several shifts in classroom practice:

#### Dialogical and Enquiry-Based Approaches

The complexity of worldviews demands **dialogical pedagogy** that:

- Creates space for genuine questioning and exploration
- Uses discussion and debate as core learning activities
- Draws on pupils' own experiences and questions
- Avoids closing down controversial or difficult topics

#### Interdisciplinary Connections

The worldviews approach naturally connects RE with other subjects including:

- **Philosophy**: for examining truth claims and arguments
- **Sociology**: for understanding how worldviews function in society
- **History**: for tracing how worldviews develop and change
- **Literature and the arts**: for exploring how worldviews are expressed culturally

#### Assessment of Understanding

Chater's emphasis on worldviews as lived and practised has implications for assessment:

- Moving beyond factual recall to assess understanding of how worldviews shape lives
- Evaluating pupils' ability to engage critically with different perspectives
- Recognising the legitimate diversity of pupil responses to questions of meaning

### Implications for Teacher Development

Chater's critique of "producer capture" has direct implications for teacher preparation:

#### Subject Knowledge Enhancement

The worldviews approach requires teachers to have:

- Strong foundational knowledge of the worldviews they teach
- Understanding of the diversity within each worldview
- Awareness of contemporary developments and debates
- Ability to engage with philosophical and theological questions

#### Professional Confidence

Chater's work highlights the need for RE teachers to develop:

- Confidence in handling controversial topics
- Skills in facilitating respectful dialogue
- Critical literacy for evaluating resources and materials
- Understanding of the political and institutional contexts of RE

## Criticisms and Debates

Chater's advocacy for radical reform has not been without critics. Several significant debates have emerged:

### The "Worldviews" Concept

Some scholars, including **Trevor Cooling** and **L. Philip Barnes**, have questioned whether "worldviews" provides a coherent framework for RE. Concerns include:

- Whether the term is too broad to have educational utility
- Whether it risks reducing religions to "worldviews" in ways that misrepresent their nature
- Whether the framework adequately captures the distinctive features of religious traditions

Cooling (2022) argued that "reform of mindset, not structures, is what is actually required"—suggesting that Chater's structural critique misses the deeper need for teachers to develop more sophisticated pedagogical approaches within existing frameworks.

### The Status of Non-Religious Worldviews

The proposal to give non-religious worldviews parity with religions has been contested:

- Some religious educators argue it dilutes the distinctive contribution of RE
- Others question whether humanism, secularism, and atheism can be studied in the same way as religious traditions
- Practical concerns have been raised about teacher expertise and resource availability

### Governance and Democratic Accountability

Chater's critique of SACREs and locally determined syllabuses raises questions about democratic accountability:

- If local determination is removed, what mechanisms ensure community voice in RE?
- How can RE respect the legal requirements for collective worship and denominational inspection in faith schools?
- What role should religious communities play in shaping education about religion?

## Connection to the Wider RE Landscape

### RE:ONLINE and Digital Resources

Chater's legacy at Culham St Gabriel's includes the continued development of **RE:ONLINE**, the Trust's flagship digital resource platform. The "reimagining" of RE:ONLINE during Chater's tenure transformed it from a static resource repository into a dynamic platform for professional development and curriculum support.

### The Religious Education Council

Through his work at Culham St Gabriel's and subsequently, Chater has maintained close connections with the **Religious Education Council of England and Wales (REC)**, the umbrella body that brings together professional associations, faith communities, and educational organisations to support RE.

### International Connections

Chater's work has influenced debates beyond England. The Commission on RE's report was watched closely in other jurisdictions grappling with similar questions about religion in education, including:

- **Wales**, which has undertaken its own curriculum reform process
- **Scotland** and **Northern Ireland**, with their distinct approaches to religious education
- International contexts including Australia, Canada, and parts of Europe

## Legacy and Ongoing Influence

Mark Chater's contribution to Religious Education extends across multiple domains:

### Institutional Legacy

The institutions Chater shaped—Culham St Gabriel's Trust, the Commission on RE, the University of Cumbria's worldviews education programme—continue to influence the field. His strategic vision for what RE could become has been institutionalised in ways that will outlast his direct involvement.

### Conceptual Legacy

The language of "worldviews" has become ubiquitous in RE discourse, even among those who disagree with Chater's specific proposals. The CoRE report established the terms of debate for a generation of RE reform discussions.

### Pedagogical Legacy

Chater's emphasis on rigorous, critical, and inclusive RE has influenced curriculum development, teacher training, and classroom practice across England. Resources like Understanding Christianity and professional development programmes reflect his vision of high-quality RE.

### Policy Legacy

While the statutory changes Chater advocated have not been implemented, his analysis of the problems facing RE has shaped policy debates. The questions he raised about governance, quality, and inclusivity continue to animate discussions about RE's future.
