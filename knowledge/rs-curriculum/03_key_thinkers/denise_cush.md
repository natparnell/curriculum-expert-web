# Denise Cush: Worldviews, Religious Literacy and the Academic Discipline of Religious Education

## Biography and Academic Position

Denise Cush is Professor Emerita of Religion and Education at Bath Spa University, where she served as Head of the Department of Study of Religions. Her academic formation includes a BA from Oxford, MA from Lancaster, and PhD from Warwick, reflecting a strong foundation in both theological and educational research traditions. Throughout her career, Cush has maintained a distinctive commitment to the academic study of religions as a discipline in its own right, while simultaneously working to translate scholarly insights into accessible and engaging classroom practice.

At Bath Spa University, Cush taught across both undergraduate and MA programmes, leading modules on Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, contemporary spiritualities (including Paganism), and methodology courses. Her teaching portfolio also included contributions on Jain thought and John Hick's philosophy of religion. This breadth of expertise across multiple religious traditions and philosophical approaches has informed her holistic vision for religious education, one that resists reduction of the subject to mere phenomenological description or instrumentalist aims.

## The Commission on Religious Education (2016-2018) and the Worldviews Approach

### Membership and Contribution

Denise Cush served as a Commissioner on the National Commission on Religious Education (CoRE) from 2016 to 2018, a pivotal appointment that placed her at the centre of the most significant rethinking of RE in England for a generation. The Commission, established by the Religious Education Council of England and Wales (REC), was charged with reviewing the provision of religious education in English schools and making recommendations for its future development.

The Commission's final report, *Religion and Worldviews: The Way Forward—A National Plan for RE* (2018), recommended changing the name of the subject from "Religious Education" to "Religion and Worldviews." This proposed change was not merely cosmetic; it represented a fundamental reconceptualisation of the subject's scope, content, and pedagogical approach.

### The Worldvision Concept

Cush has been instrumental in clarifying and developing the theoretical underpinnings of the worldviews approach. As she articulated in subsequent publications, the Commission's intention was to find an approach to representing and teaching about religion and worldviews that "helps the students to get away from the problem of ever-expanding content in order to look at how worldviews work." This represents a crucial shift from accumulating facts about religious traditions to understanding the mechanisms by which worldviews—whether religious or non-religious—shape human experience, meaning-making, and behaviour.

The adoption of "worldviews" as a key concept was motivated by recognition that traditional frameworks for RE were struggling to accommodate the complexity of contemporary religious and non-religious diversity. The singular "Religion" in the proposed new title signals the need to examine the very concept of religion itself, while "Worldviews" acknowledges that many pupils and their families may identify with secular, humanist, or other non-religious frameworks of meaning.

### Ongoing Development Work

Following the Commission's report, Cush continued to contribute to the development of the worldviews approach through her work on the Steering Group for the REC and TRS-UK joint project on the concept of 'worldview(s)' and its application to RE (2019-2021). This project sought to provide the theoretical and pedagogical infrastructure necessary to translate the Commission's recommendations into classroom practice.

## The Big Ideas for Religious Education Project

### Origins and Aims

Alongside her work on the Commission, Cush made a major contribution to the **Big Ideas for Religious Education** project, directed by Dr Barbara Wintersgill. The project began in 2016, contemporaneously with CoRE, arising from shared concerns about the future of religious education in English schools. Both initiatives recognised that RE was in a "parlous state" in many schools and required substantial curriculum reform.

The Big Ideas approach represents a fundamental reconceptualisation of curriculum planning in RE. Rather than organising content around religious traditions (the "lived religion" approach) or discrete themes, the Big Ideas framework identifies substantial, generative concepts that can sustain pupils' intellectual engagement across their entire school career and beyond.

### The Big Ideas Framework

The project identified a set of Big Ideas that constitute the conceptual architecture of the subject. These ideas are:

- **Substantial**: They represent significant insights into religion and worldviews
- **Transferable**: They have application across different traditions and contexts
- **Generative**: They generate further questions and lines of inquiry
- **Intellectually demanding**: They challenge pupils to think deeply and critically
- **Enduring**: They remain relevant throughout and beyond formal education

In 2019, Cush published "Putting Big Ideas into Practice in Religious Education" (co-authored with Barbara Wintersgill and Dave Francis), which provided practical guidance for curriculum developers. This was followed by the launch of the **Big Ideas for Religious Education website** in July 2022, which provides a complete guide for those developing the RE curriculum, including units of work for all ages developed by a team of teachers and educational professionals.

### Cush's Distinctive Contribution

Cush's work on the Big Ideas project brought together her academic expertise in the study of religions with her practical knowledge of classroom realities. Her writings on the project reflect a concern to maintain academic rigour while ensuring accessibility for busy teachers working in challenging contexts. The Big Ideas framework, as she has articulated it, is not merely a curriculum planning tool but a means of securing the academic integrity and public credibility of the subject.

## Buddhism in Religious Education

### Foundational Textbook

Denise Cush's contribution to the teaching of Buddhism in schools extends across three decades. Her textbook, *Buddhism: A Student's Approach to World Religion* (Hodder Education, 1994), remains a standard reference work for A-level Religious Studies and undergraduate courses. The book was designed to meet the needs of students embarking on advanced programmes, striking a balance between scholarly views and accessible expression.

The textbook examines the life and teaching of the Buddha, the early development of Buddhism, and the major branches of Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism. It also addresses the significant but often neglected topic of Buddhism in the West, recognising that for many pupils, their encounter with Buddhism will be mediated through Western adaptations and contemporary manifestations rather than traditional Asian contexts.

### Pedagogical Contributions

Cush has continued to develop resources and approaches for teaching Buddhism in schools. She has provided subject knowledge resources for Buddhist worldview traditions for REonline, the national RE support website. Her recent publications include contributions to *Buddhism in Five Minutes* (Equinox, 2021), addressing questions such as "Is Buddhism a religion?" and "Should Buddhism be taught in schools?"

These questions are not merely academic. As Cush recognises, they touch on fundamental issues in RE pedagogy: how do we represent traditions that may not fit comfortably within Western categories of "religion"? How do we teach about traditions with which we have limited historical engagement in the UK? Her work on Buddhism demonstrates how scholarly attention to the particularities of specific traditions can inform broader pedagogical principles.

### Mahayana Buddhism and Contemporary Approaches

Cush's more recent work has addressed the teaching of Mahayana Buddhism specifically. Her 2021 paper "Making Sense of Mahayana Buddhism (and a non-binary personal worldview)" reflects both her scholarly engagement with Buddhist thought and her awareness of contemporary educational contexts. This work recognises that Buddhist concepts may offer resources for addressing contemporary questions of identity and meaning that resonate with pupils' lived experience.

## Religious Literacy and the Academic Discipline of RE

### Defending Academic Integrity

Throughout her career, Cush has been a consistent advocate for understanding RE as an academic subject "like any other... and some!" (to borrow the title of one of her contributions to the Religious Studies Project). This formulation acknowledges that RE has the same entitlement to academic rigour as other humanities subjects, while also recognising its distinctive characteristics arising from its engagement with questions of ultimate meaning and value.

Her defence of the academic discipline of RE has become particularly significant in an educational climate where the subject's status has been increasingly marginalised. Cush argues that the study of religions and worldviews constitutes a genuine academic discipline with its own methods, concepts, and body of knowledge—what she terms the "Study of Religions" (with capital letters indicating its disciplinary status).

### RE as an Academic Subject

In her influential essay "Religious Education in State-Funded Schools: An Academic Subject Like Any Other... and Some!" (2020), Cush articulated a vision of RE that draws on the disciplinary expertise of Theology and Religious Studies (TRS) while being appropriate for all pupils in state-funded schools, regardless of their own religious or non-religious backgrounds. This positioning requires careful navigation between confessional and purely descriptive approaches, seeking what Cush terms an "educationally worthwhile" treatment of religious and non-religious worldviews.

### The Discipline Debate

Cush has contributed significantly to debates about the disciplinary foundations of RE. Her publications address questions such as: What are the appropriate academic disciplines that should inform RE? How do the various approaches within the Study of Religions—phenomenological, anthropological, sociological, theological, philosophical—translate into school-level pedagogy? Her work on these questions reflects both her academic training and her practical experience of teacher education.

## The Living Religion Project and Experiential Learning

### Origins and Development

One of Cush's most distinctive contributions to religious education at the tertiary level was the development of the **Living Religion Project**, created in collaboration with her colleague Catherine Robinson. The project grew out of a unique feature of the Study of Religions programme at Bath Spa: a compulsory one-week placement in a religious or worldview community, which had been a requirement since the 1970s.

The Living Religion Project website was developed to support these placements and to make the insights gained available more widely. It provides resources for students undertaking placements in diverse religious and worldview communities, helping them to approach these experiences with appropriate methodological sophistication and ethical sensitivity.

### Shap Award Recognition

In 2013, the Living Religion Project received the **Shap Award for outstanding contribution to Education in Religions**. This recognition from the Shap Working Party on World Religions in Education—one of the most respected bodies in the field—testifies to the project's significance as a model of experiential learning in religious education.

### Pedagogical Principles

The Living Religion Project embodies Cush's commitment to **ethnographic and experiential approaches** to the study of religions. Rather than treating religions as merely textual or historical phenomena, the project encourages students to engage with living communities, observing practices, participating where appropriate, and reflecting critically on their experiences. This approach has significant implications for school-level RE, suggesting the value of visits, encounters, and dialogue with local religious and worldview communities—while also modelling the critical reflection necessary to make such encounters educationally productive.

## Editorial and Professional Service

### British Journal of Religious Education

From 2011 to 2018, Cush served as Deputy Editor of the *British Journal of Religious Education* (BJRE), the leading academic journal in the field. In this role, she helped to shape the scholarly conversation about RE, commissioning and reviewing articles that advanced both theoretical understanding and practical innovation. Her editorial work contributed to maintaining rigorous academic standards while ensuring the journal's relevance to classroom practitioners.

### International Advisory Work

Cush's expertise has been sought internationally. She served as International Adviser for a four-year project (2015-2019) funded by the Swedish Research Council, "Teaching Religion in Late Modern Sweden," led by Principal Investigator Anders Sjöborg. This project examined how professionalism in religious education is negotiated on the borders between public and private spheres in the Swedish context. Her involvement reflects both the international respect for her work and her interest in comparative approaches to religious education policy and practice.

### RE Council Contributions

Beyond her role on CoRE, Cush has made ongoing contributions to the work of the Religious Education Council of England and Wales. She has assisted with the REC's continuing Worldviews project, helping to develop the resources and professional development necessary to implement the Commission's recommendations.

## Influence and Legacy

### Impact on Curriculum Development

Denise Cush's influence on religious education in England is substantial and multifaceted. Through her work on the Commission on Religious Education, she has helped to shape the policy framework within which the subject will develop over the coming decades. The proposed shift to "Religion and Worldviews" represents the most significant reconceptualisation of the subject since the 1970s, and Cush's intellectual contribution to this shift has been central.

Through the Big Ideas project, she has provided practical resources that are already influencing curriculum development in schools across the country. The Big Ideas framework offers a theoretically grounded yet practically applicable approach to curriculum planning that addresses many of the frustrations teachers have experienced with existing models.

### Contribution to Teacher Education

Cush's work at Bath Spa University and through the Living Religion Project has influenced the formation of generations of RE teachers. Her emphasis on the academic discipline of the Study of Religions, combined with her commitment to experiential and ethnographic approaches, has provided a model for how specialist subject knowledge can be developed in ways that inform rather than replace pedagogical thinking.

### Scholarly Contribution

As a scholar, Cush has made significant contributions across multiple areas: the pedagogy of Buddhism, the theory and practice of the worldviews approach, the academic foundations of RE, and curriculum design. Her publications are characterised by clarity of exposition, rigour of argument, and a consistent attention to the needs of both academic and practitioner audiences.

### Ongoing Relevance

Even in emerita status, Cush remains active in the field, continuing to contribute to the development of the Big Ideas website, supporting the REC's worldviews work, and writing on topics such as Mahayana Buddhism and RE pedagogy. Her ongoing engagement testifies to her commitment to the subject and to the communities of practice—academic and school-based—that sustain it.

## Pedagogical Implications for Classroom Practice

### Teaching About Worldviews

Cush's work suggests several key principles for teaching about worldviews in schools:

1. **Focus on how worldviews work** rather than merely accumulating facts about specific traditions. This involves helping pupils understand the mechanisms by which worldviews shape perception, meaning-making, and behaviour.

2. **Include both religious and non-religious worldviews** on an equitable basis, recognising that all pupils have worldviews that shape their engagement with the material.

3. **Maintain academic rigour** by drawing on the disciplinary approaches of the Study of Religions, including phenomenological, anthropological, sociological, and philosophical methods.

4. **Address the concept of "religion" itself** as a contested category that different worldviews may understand and construct differently.

### Implementing Big Ideas

For teachers seeking to apply the Big Ideas framework, Cush's work suggests:

1. **Identify the generative concepts** that can sustain pupils' intellectual engagement across key stages, rather than planning around expandable content lists.

2. **Plan for progression** in pupils' understanding of these ideas, recognising that Big Ideas can be accessed at different levels of sophistication.

3. **Connect the particular to the universal** by using specific examples from religious and non-religious traditions to illuminate broader conceptual questions.

### Teaching Buddhism Effectively

Drawing on Cush's specialist work, teachers of Buddhism might:

1. **Address the question "Is Buddhism a religion?"** as a genuine inquiry rather than a settled matter, recognising the diversity of Buddhist self-understanding and the contested nature of the category "religion."

2. **Include both Theravada and Mahayana traditions** ensuring pupils understand the historical development and doctrinal diversity of Buddhism.

3. **
3. **Acknowledge Western Buddhism** as a significant context for many pupils' encounter with Buddhist ideas, while also ensuring adequate attention to Asian contexts.

4. **Explore Buddhist concepts as resources for contemporary questions** such as mindfulness, wellbeing, and ecological awareness, while maintaining historical and cultural specificity.

## Conclusion

Denise Cush represents a distinctive voice in contemporary religious education—one that bridges the academic study of religions and the practical demands of classroom teaching. Her work on the Commission on Religious Education has positioned her as a key architect of the proposed "Religion and Worldviews" transformation, while her Big Ideas project provides the practical resources necessary to realise this vision in schools.

Cush's career exemplifies the possibility of maintaining both academic rigour and pedagogical relevance. From her foundational textbook on Buddhism to her innovative work on experiential learning through the Living Religion Project, she has consistently sought to make the study of religions accessible without sacrificing intellectual depth. Her defence of RE as an academic subject "like any other... and some" captures both the entitlement of the subject to rigorous treatment and its distinctive contribution to pupils' education.

For teachers and curriculum developers, Cush's work offers both theoretical frameworks and practical tools. The worldviews approach, the Big Ideas framework, and the principles of experiential learning she has articulated provide resources for reimagining religious education in ways that are academically sound, pedagogically effective, and responsive to the diverse worldviews of contemporary pupils. As the subject navigates the challenges of the coming decades, Cush's contributions will continue to shape its development and defend its place in the curriculum.
