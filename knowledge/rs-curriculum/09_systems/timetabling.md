# Timetabling and Regularity in Religious Education

## Introduction

The organisation of curriculum time for Religious Education (RE) represents one of the most significant structural factors influencing pupil learning outcomes. Unlike most National Curriculum subjects, RE occupies a unique position: it is a statutory requirement for all state-funded schools in England, yet it lacks prescribed time allocations in legislation. This ambiguity creates substantial variation in how schools structure RE provision, with profound consequences for what pupils learn and retain. Ofsted's 2024 subject report, *Deep and Meaningful?*, identified timetabling irregularity as a key factor undermining the quality of RE in many schools, noting that "long gaps between lessons hindered pupils' recall" and that "pupils remembered more when they had regular lessons."

This knowledge file examines the research, policy context, and practical considerations surrounding timetabling and regularity in RE. It explores the tension between competing timetabling models, the cognitive science underlying spaced versus massed practice, the statutory framework governing time allocation, and practical strategies for leaders seeking to optimise their RE provision. Understanding these dynamics is essential for curriculum leaders and senior leadership teams committed to ensuring that RE fulfils its potential as a rigorous academic subject that prepares pupils for life in a complex, multi-religious and multi-secular society.

## The Current Context: RE on the Margins

### The Periphery Problem

RE in many English schools suffers from what NATRE (the National Association of Teachers of Religious Education) has termed "the periphery problem." In its 2025 strategic brief, NATRE observed that RE is "too often treated as peripheral — squeezed into tutor time, assemblies, or allocated significantly less curriculum time than other foundation subjects such as history and geography." This marginalisation is not simply an issue of balance or fairness; it has clear and measurable consequences for pupil attainment, equity, and preparedness for life in the modern world.

Ofsted's 2024 research found that in the secondary phase, "most statutory non-examined RE was limited and of a poor quality." A notable proportion of schools did not meet the statutory requirement to teach RE to pupils at all stages of their schooling. The report documented instances where Year 11 pupils received zero hours of RE teaching, and where RE lessons were frequently taught by teachers predominantly assigned to other subjects — 51% of RE lessons in secondary schools according to parliamentary records.

### The Casualisation of RE Time

One manifestation of RE's marginal status is the casualisation of its timetable allocation. RE lessons are frequently scheduled into "unfilled timetable slots" — periods that cannot be filled by specialist teachers in high-status subjects. As noted in parliamentary debates, "RE often becomes the lesson filled by a teacher of another subject with a few spare lessons on their timetable." This practice creates a vicious cycle: irregular scheduling leads to poorer outcomes, which reinforces perceptions of RE as less important, which in turn justifies further marginalisation.

The consequences extend beyond staffing. RE lessons scheduled at irregular intervals — once a fortnight, or sporadically across a term — create significant barriers to learning. Pupils struggle to build coherent mental schemas when content is encountered in disconnected fragments, separated by lengthy intervals during which other subjects dominate their cognitive attention.

## The Cognitive Science of Lesson Frequency

### The Spacing Effect and Distributed Practice

Contemporary cognitive science offers powerful insights into why lesson regularity matters. The "spacing effect" — also known as distributed practice — refers to the well-documented finding that learning opportunities spaced apart in time produce superior retention compared to the same amount of learning concentrated in a single session. Research by Cepeda et al. (2006) and others has demonstrated that distributed practice enhances long-term retention across diverse domains and age groups.

The spacing effect operates through multiple mechanisms:

**Consolidation and Memory Reconsolidation:** When pupils encounter material after a delay, they must engage in active retrieval from long-term memory. This retrieval process strengthens neural pathways and promotes consolidation. Each successful retrieval makes subsequent retrieval easier, creating a virtuous cycle of strengthening memory traces.

**Encoding Variability:** Spaced exposures to content occur in different contexts and mental states. This variability enriches encoding, creating multiple retrieval pathways to the same knowledge. When RE lessons are irregularly spaced, each lesson potentially occurs in a different cognitive context — after mathematics, before lunch, following PE — which can aid distinctiveness of encoding.

**Forgetting and Relearning:** The spacing effect leverages the natural forgetting curve identified by Ebbinghaus. By revisiting content just as it begins to fade from immediate recall, pupils engage in productive struggle that deepens learning. As Rohrer and Pashler (2007) demonstrated, this process produces more durable learning than continuous exposure.

### The Distributed Practice Effect in Classroom Contexts

Recent meta-analytic research has confirmed the applicability of distributed practice to classroom learning. A 2025 meta-analysis published in *Psychological Bulletin* examined the distributed practice effect across applied educational research, finding robust benefits for spaced versus massed instruction. The researchers noted that "when learning is distributed across intervals, the effort required to retrieve it increases slightly, but so does the chance that it sticks."

Critically for RE, distributed practice appears particularly effective for complex conceptual learning. Vlach and Sandhofer (2012) demonstrated that spacing lessons apart promoted complex generalisation in children's acquisition of science concepts. The benefits of spacing were present one week after the last lesson, suggesting durable advantages for spaced instruction. RE, with its emphasis on nuanced understanding of religious and non-religious worldviews, stands to benefit substantially from approaches that promote deep, transferable learning.

### Massed Practice and Its Limitations

Massed practice — concentrated learning in intensive blocks — can produce impressive short-term performance. Pupils may appear to learn quickly when content is encountered in concentrated doses. However, this apparent efficiency masks a fundamental problem: massed practice produces rapid gains in immediate performance but poor long-term retention.

The limitations of massed practice are particularly problematic for RE. When RE is taught in intensive blocks — for example, during a dedicated "RE week" or concentrated into a single term — pupils may demonstrate satisfactory immediate performance. However, without subsequent spaced retrieval, this learning decays rapidly. Ofsted's observation that pupils in many schools "remembered very little" when curricula tried to cover many religions "like equal slices of a pie" reflects, in part, the consequences of insufficiently spaced, insufficiently retrieved learning.

## Ofsted Findings on Regularity and Recall

### The 2024 Subject Report: Key Evidence

Ofsted's 2024 subject report *Deep and Meaningful?* provided the most comprehensive official analysis of RE timetabling to date. The report drew on evidence from inspections and dedicated research visits across primary and secondary schools, including provision from Reception Year through to sixth form.

The report's findings on timetabling were unequivocal:

- "Long gaps between lessons hindered pupils' recall"
- "Pupils remembered more when they had regular lessons"
- "Schools should organise the timetable for RE so that gaps between teaching are minimised"

These findings emerged from direct observation of pupil performance. Inspectors found that when RE lessons were separated by lengthy intervals — particularly the gap between weekly lessons in a fortnightly timetable model — pupils struggled to connect new learning to prior content. They observed pupils who could not recall concepts encountered in previous lessons, requiring teachers to spend valuable time on recapitulation rather than advancing learning.

### The Mechanism of Forgetting

The report identified a specific mechanism through which irregular timetabling undermines learning: the decay of accessible knowledge between lessons. When pupils encounter RE content and then engage with entirely different subjects for days or weeks, the RE learning is pushed to the periphery of working memory. Without retrieval opportunities, it becomes progressively less accessible.

This decay is not merely a matter of pupil effort or engagement. It reflects fundamental properties of human memory. Without rehearsal and retrieval, memories weaken. RE content — often conceptually demanding, involving unfamiliar vocabulary, abstract theological concepts, and complex cultural contexts — is particularly vulnerable to such decay. Irregular timetabling exacerbates this vulnerability, creating conditions where each lesson effectively begins from scratch.

### Recommendations for Leaders

Based on this evidence, Ofsted made specific recommendations for school leaders:

1. **Check that the time allocated for teaching RE at all key stages is used effectively** so that pupils learn a curriculum that is both broad and deep
2. **Organise the timetable for RE so that gaps between teaching are minimised**
3. **Check that pupils recall and understand the intended curriculum over time** and that the domain of their knowledge is expanding

These recommendations place clear responsibilities on senior leadership teams to attend to the structural conditions that enable effective RE. Timetabling is not merely an administrative convenience; it is a pedagogical decision with measurable consequences for pupil learning.

## Timetabling Models: Competing Approaches

### The Weekly Model

The traditional weekly model allocates RE as a regular, recurring lesson — typically one hour per week — throughout the academic year. This model offers significant advantages in terms of regularity and recall. Pupils encounter RE at consistent intervals, building cumulative knowledge week by week.

**Advantages:**
- Regular retrieval opportunities maintain knowledge accessibility
- Consistent scheduling supports routine formation and behavioural norms
- Easier integration with schemes of learning designed for weekly progression
- Supports distributed practice by design

**Challenges:**
- In secondary schools, may limit total curriculum time available for RE
- Difficult to sustain where staffing is shared across multiple subjects
- Can feel fragmented if lessons are too brief for sustained inquiry

### The Fortnightly Model

The fortnightly model concentrates the same curriculum time into less frequent, longer sessions — typically a double lesson every two weeks. This approach is common in secondary schools where timetable constraints make weekly RE difficult to staff.

**Advantages:**
- More efficient staffing, particularly with part-time or shared staff
- Longer sessions allow for sustained activities and deeper engagement
- Easier to timetable around other subjects' requirements

**Challenges:**
- The two-week gap between lessons significantly hampers recall
- Pupils may experience RE as episodic rather than continuous
- Difficult to maintain momentum and routine
- Contradicts Ofsted's recommendation to minimise gaps

Research on the fortnightly model specifically for RE is limited, but the broader evidence on distributed practice suggests that concentrating learning into less frequent sessions undermines long-term retention. The 2024 Ofsted report's finding that "long gaps between lessons hindered pupils' recall" likely reflects, in part, the prevalence of fortnightly timetabling in secondary schools.

### Blocked Curriculum Models

Some primary schools have adopted "blocked curriculum" approaches, timetabling foundation subjects including RE into intensive weekly or fortnightly blocks. Proponents argue that blocked teaching allows subjects to be taught with "equal equity and quality focused time."

However, blocked approaches conflict directly with the evidence on distributed practice. While they may facilitate resource concentration and teacher focus, they sacrifice the regular retrieval that supports long-term retention. For RE specifically, blocked models risk presenting the subject as a discrete, self-contained module rather than an ongoing area of inquiry. The connections between RE and pupils' developing understanding of the world — connections that require ongoing, spaced reflection — may be weakened.

### Termly Rotation Models

In some primary schools, RE is taught in termly rotations, with each foundation subject receiving intensive focus for a term before rotating to the next. This model creates extremely extended gaps between RE encounters — potentially six months or more.

The evidence on spacing effects suggests that such extended gaps would be highly detrimental to retention. While pupils might engage intensively with RE during their allocated term, the subsequent months without RE would allow substantial forgetting. When RE returns to the timetable, teachers would face the challenge of rebuilding foundational knowledge from scratch.

## Statutory Requirements and Time Allocation

### The Legal Framework

RE is a statutory subject for all state-funded schools in England, including academies and free schools. The Education Act 1996 and subsequent legislation require that RE be taught to all pupils of compulsory school age, with the exception of those who have been withdrawn by their parents.

However, unlike National Curriculum subjects, RE has no nationally prescribed time allocation. Maintained schools must teach RE according to their locally agreed syllabus, but the syllabus does not specify hours. Academies and free schools must teach RE according to their funding agreement, but again, specific time allocations are not mandated.

This absence of statutory time guidance creates significant variation. NATRE and the Religious Education Council have advocated for clearer time expectations, noting that the lack of specification enables the marginalisation documented by Ofsted.

### Recommended Time Allocations

While not statutory, several authoritative sources offer guidance on appropriate time allocation:

**Ofsted Research Review (2021):** Most agreed syllabi recommend spending the equivalent of approximately 60 minutes a week on RE at Key Stage 1 and about 75 minutes a week at Key Stage 2. Most RE provision in Reception would be integrated within the Early Years Foundation Stage curriculum.

**GCSE Requirements:** For schools offering GCSE Religious Studies, examination awarding bodies recommend a minimum of 140 hours for the full course. This provides a benchmark for Key Stage 4 provision, though it applies only to examined RE, not statutory non-examined RE.

**NATRE Guidance:** NATRE has advocated for RE to receive time allocation equivalent to other foundation subjects, arguing that the current disparity sends implicit messages about the subject's status and undermines its effectiveness.

### The 5% Rule

Many agreed syllabi state that RE should be allocated a minimum of 5% of curriculum time. For a typical secondary school week of 25 hours, this would equate to approximately 75 minutes. However, this benchmark is widely ignored. Research by the National Association of Teachers of Religious Education found that many schools allocate substantially less than this recommendation, particularly at Key Stage 4 where non-examined RE often receives minimal or zero time.

## Practical Strategies for Optimising RE Timetabling

### Prioritising Weekly Regularity

The evidence strongly supports prioritising weekly RE lessons over fortnightly or less frequent alternatives. While staffing constraints may make this challenging, leaders should recognise that fortnightly timetabling involves a genuine educational cost. Where weekly RE is genuinely impossible, schools should consider:

- Allocating RE to consecutive days rather than spreading gaps (e.g., Monday and Tuesday rather than Monday and Friday)
- Embedding short retrieval activities in tutor time or assemblies to bridge the gap
- Explicitly teaching pupils retrieval strategies for maintaining knowledge between sessions

### Protecting RE from Timetable Drift

RE is particularly vulnerable to "timetable drift" — the gradual erosion of allocated time through repeated displacement by other activities. Assemblies, trips, sports days, and examination revision frequently consume RE time because it is perceived as less critical than other subjects.

School leaders should establish clear policies protecting RE time. This might include:

- Formal parity with other subjects in timetabling decisions
- Requirement that any displacement of RE time be compensated elsewhere
- Regular monitoring of actual versus allocated RE time
- Inclusion of RE in calculations of curriculum breadth

### Aligning Timetabling with Curriculum Design

Effective timetabling requires alignment with curriculum intent. If a curriculum is designed for weekly progression but timetabled fortnightly, the curriculum will not be delivered effectively. Leaders should ensure that schemes of learning explicitly address the timetabling model in use, with appropriate bridging and retrieval activities for less frequent models.

### Considerations for Different Key Stages

**Key Stage 1 and 2:** Primary schools have more flexibility in timetabling, but this can enable problematic approaches such as termly rotations. Leaders should prioritise regular, weekly RE encounters that support the gradual building of knowledge over time. The integration of RE within broader curriculum themes should not obscure its distinctive identity or allow it to be subsumed entirely.

**Key Stage 3:** Regular weekly RE is particularly important at Key Stage 3, when pupils are building foundational knowledge that will support future study. The 2024 Ofsted report found significant weaknesses in Key Stage 3 provision, with many schools failing to meet statutory requirements. Leaders should ensure that Key Stage 3 RE receives appropriate time and regularity.

**Key Stage 4:** The evidence suggests that non-examined RE at Key Stage 4 is frequently marginalised or absent altogether. Where schools do provide statutory non-examined RE, they should apply the same principles of regularity and time allocation that apply to other key stages. The absence of examinations does not diminish the educational importance of the subject.

**Sixth Form:** RE provision post-16 varies widely. Where offered, it should follow the same principles of regularity and adequate time allocation.

## The Impact of Irregular Lessons on Specific RE Domains

### Substantive Knowledge

Substantive knowledge in RE — knowledge about religious and non-religious traditions, their beliefs, practices, and expressions — is particularly vulnerable to forgetting when lessons are irregular. Vocabulary acquisition requires repeated encounters in context. Irregular timetabling reduces the frequency of such encounters, impeding the development of rich mental schemas.

For example, a pupil learning about the Five K pillars of Islam needs multiple exposures to these concepts, with opportunities to retrieve and apply them, before they become securely encoded. Fortnightly lessons mean that each encounter is separated by two weeks of entirely different content, increasing the cognitive load of recall and slowing the consolidation process.

### Disciplinary Knowledge

Disciplinary knowledge — understanding how knowledge about religion is constructed, evaluated, and contested — requires sustained engagement with questions of method, interpretation, and evidence. Irregular timetabling disrupts the accumulation of disciplinary understanding, as pupils struggle to maintain engagement with ongoing debates and methodological considerations.

### Personal Knowledge

Personal knowledge — pupils' developing awareness of their own beliefs, values, and perspectives — requires reflective space and ongoing dialogue. Irregular RE lessons limit opportunities for the gradual development of personal reflection that the subject ideally supports.

## Addressing the Staffing Challenge

### The Non-Specialist Problem

The prevalence of non-specialist RE teaching — 51% of lessons in secondary schools according to parliamentary evidence — is both a cause and consequence of timetabling difficulties. RE lessons taught by teachers primarily assigned to other subjects are more likely to be scheduled into unfilled timetable slots, creating irregular patterns.

Addressing this challenge requires:

- Investment in subject-specific professional development for non-specialists
- Protected time for RE CPD within school calendars
- Recognition of RE expertise in staffing and timetabling decisions
- Advocacy for RE specialism in ITT and recruitment

### Team Teaching and Collaboration

Some schools have addressed staffing challenges through team teaching models, where RE specialists support non-specialists through collaborative planning and observation. This approach can help maintain quality while accommodating
