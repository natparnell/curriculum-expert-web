# Curriculum Selection and Prioritisation in Religious Education

## Introduction: The Challenge of Curriculum Selection

Religious Education (RE) in English schools faces a distinctive challenge that few other subjects encounter: the scope of potential content far exceeds what can reasonably be taught within the time available. RE encompasses the study of multiple religious traditions—Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism—alongside non-religious worldviews such as Humanism, secularism, and atheism. Within each tradition lies a vast repository of beliefs, practices, texts, histories, and contemporary expressions. The RE teacher must navigate this complexity and make principled decisions about what content deserves curriculum time and what must be set aside.

This challenge is compounded by RE's unique legal framework. Unlike National Curriculum subjects, RE is locally determined through Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education (SACREs) and agreed syllabuses. Schools without a religious character follow their locally agreed syllabus, while faith schools typically follow their trust deed or denomination's programme of study. This local determination means there is no national specification of content, leaving significant autonomy—and responsibility—with curriculum designers.

The Ofsted research review for RE (2021) identifies curriculum selection as a critical determinant of subject quality. High-quality RE does not attempt to cover everything superficially; instead, it makes thoughtful choices about what pupils should know, understand, and be able to do. This knowledge base explores the principles, frameworks, and practical strategies that underpin effective curriculum selection and prioritisation in RE.

## The Foundations of Curriculum Selection

### The Legal and Policy Context

Understanding the legal framework for RE is essential for making defensible curriculum decisions. The Education Act 1996 requires that RE be provided for all registered pupils in maintained schools, including those in the reception year, though parents retain the right to withdraw their children. The content of RE is determined locally: each local authority with responsibility for education must convene a SACRE to advise on matters relating to RE and collective worship.

The SACRE must produce an agreed syllabus for RE, which sets out what pupils aged 3 to 19 will study in maintained schools within that authority's area. This syllabus is legally binding for community schools and voluntary controlled schools. Voluntary aided schools and faith academies may follow their own trust deed or religious designation rather than the locally agreed syllabus, though many draw upon it as a resource.

The non-statutory National Framework for RE (2004) and the more recent National Content Standard for RE (2023), published by the Religious Education Council of England and Wales (REC), provide guidance on curriculum construction. The National Content Standard does not prescribe specific content but establishes benchmarks for the subject within the current legal framework, including the selection of content. It provides a format familiar to school leaders and curriculum developers while respecting the principle of local determination.

### The Problem of Coverage

A fundamental tension exists in RE between the breadth of potential content and the depth of understanding required for genuine learning. The Ofsted research review notes that attempts to teach too many religions and worldviews superficially result in pupils acquiring disconnected fragments of knowledge rather than coherent understanding. Pupils may be able to name festivals, artefacts, and practices from numerous traditions without grasping the beliefs that make them meaningful or the diversity within each tradition.

The concept of "mile-wide, inch-deep" curricula is particularly pertinent to RE. When teachers feel pressure to cover multiple religions each year, perhaps ticking off Christianity in autumn, Diwali in November, and Christmas in December, the result is often a shallow encounter with each. Pupils may remember that Hindus celebrate Diwali with lights, but not understand the significance of Rama's return to Ayodhya, the diversity of Diwali practices across India and the diaspora, or how this festival connects to broader Hindu concepts of dharma, light over darkness, and knowledge over ignorance.

Effective curriculum selection requires resisting the pressure to cover everything. Instead, it demands clarity about what constitutes essential knowledge—the concepts, narratives, practices, and ways of thinking that provide the foundation for understanding religious and non-religious worldviews.

## Conceptual Frameworks for Curriculum Selection

### The Big Ideas for RE Framework

One influential approach to curriculum selection is the Big Ideas for RE framework, developed through collaboration between academic researchers, curriculum theorists, and classroom practitioners. This framework proposes six organising principles—"Big Ideas"—that structure the selection and sequencing of RE content across all key stages.

The six Big Ideas are:

**Continuity, Change and Diversity**: This Big Idea addresses how religions and worldviews maintain continuities over time while also changing, and how they exhibit internal diversity. It helps pupils understand that religions are not monolithic or static but are lived differently across cultures, historical periods, and individual interpretations. Curriculum content selected through this lens might include how Christianity has changed from its first-century origins to its contemporary global expressions, or how British Islam reflects both universal Muslim practices and specific local adaptations.

**Words and Beyond**: This Big Idea explores how religious and non-religious worldviews communicate—through sacred texts, oral traditions, art, architecture, music, ritual, and silence. It recognises that much religious meaning cannot be reduced to verbal propositions. Curriculum selection here prioritises opportunities for pupils to engage with diverse forms of expression, from examining Qur'anic calligraphy to analysing the architecture of Hindu mandirs or the role of meditation in Buddhism.

**A Good Life**: This Big Idea focuses on ethical dimensions—how different traditions understand what it means to live well, the sources of moral guidance they draw upon, and how they navigate ethical dilemmas. Curriculum content might include comparing concepts of ahimsa (non-violence) in Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism; exploring Christian perspectives on the Golden Rule; or examining Humanist approaches to ethical decision-making without reference to divine authority.

**Making Sense of Life's Experiences**: This Big Idea addresses existential questions—birth, death, suffering, meaning, purpose—that religious and non-religious worldviews seek to address. It helps pupils understand why religions and worldviews matter to people and how they provide frameworks for interpreting human experience. Curriculum selection here might include how different traditions respond to death and bereavement, or how they understand the purpose of human existence.

**Influence and Power**: This Big Idea examines how religions and worldviews influence individuals, communities, and societies, and how power operates within and between them. It includes consideration of religious authority, the relationship between religion and the state, and the impact of religious belief on social change. Curriculum content might explore the role of religion in British history, contemporary debates about religious freedom, or how religious organisations contribute to social welfare.

**The Big Picture**: This Big Idea concerns how religions and worldviews understand the ultimate nature of reality—the divine, the cosmos, humanity's place within it. It addresses metaphysical and theological questions that shape how believers understand everything else. Curriculum selection here includes creation narratives, concepts of God or ultimate reality, and understandings of life after death.

The Big Ideas framework offers several advantages for curriculum selection. It provides coherence across the curriculum, as pupils encounter the same Big Ideas repeatedly with increasing sophistication. It justifies content selection—teachers can explain why particular content has been chosen by reference to which Big Idea it illuminates. And it ensures breadth, as the six Big Ideas between them encompass the full range of what is educationally valuable in RE.

### The Three Disciplines of RE

Another influential framework for curriculum selection comes from the recognition that RE draws upon multiple academic disciplines. The Ofsted research review and the National Content Standard identify three primary disciplinary approaches: theology, philosophy, and the human/social sciences.

**Theological approaches** examine religious phenomena from within the perspective of religious traditions themselves. They take seriously the claims believers make about reality, considering questions such as: What do Christians mean when they say Jesus is the Son of God? How do Muslims understand the nature of the Qur'an as revelation? Theological approaches require curriculum content that includes sacred texts, doctrinal statements, and the internal reasoning of religious traditions.

**Philosophical approaches** engage with the critical examination of religious and non-religious claims using the tools of philosophical reasoning. They address questions such as: Can the existence of God be proved or disproved? How do we resolve conflicts between religious claims and scientific accounts of origins? Is there objective moral truth, or are all moral claims relative? Curriculum selection here includes exposure to arguments, thought experiments, and the methods of philosophical analysis.

**Human/social science approaches** examine religious and non-religious phenomena as human social realities, using methods drawn from sociology, anthropology, and psychology. They ask questions such as: How does belonging to a religious community affect individual identity? How do religious practices vary across cultures? What functions does religion serve in society? Curriculum content here includes empirical studies, ethnographic accounts, and sociological theories of religion.

The three disciplines framework provides criteria for curriculum selection by ensuring that pupils encounter religious and non-religious worldviews through multiple lenses. A curriculum that relied solely on theological approaches would miss the critical perspective essential for education in a pluralist society; one that relied solely on social science would miss the internal meanings that make religious practices significant to believers. Effective curriculum selection balances these disciplinary approaches appropriate to pupils' ages and prior knowledge.

## Principles for Prioritising Content

### Substantive Knowledge and Substantive Concepts

A key principle for curriculum selection is the distinction between substantive knowledge—specific content about particular religions and worldviews—and substantive concepts—organising ideas that recur across multiple contexts. Both require careful prioritisation.

Substantive knowledge includes the stories, doctrines, practices, and historical developments that constitute the content of specific traditions. Curriculum designers must decide which religions and worldviews to include and to what depth. The National Content Standard recommends that all pupils should study Christianity throughout their school career, reflecting its historical and contemporary significance in Britain. Beyond this, schools have discretion, though most agreed syllabuses also require substantive engagement with the five other principal religions: Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. Increasingly, agreed syllabuses also require the inclusion of non-religious worldviews such as Humanism.

Substantive concepts are the organising ideas that enable pupils to make sense of substantive knowledge. Examples include concepts such as 'God', 'worship', 'sacred', 'community', 'ritual', 'authority', and 'identity'. These concepts are not unique to any single tradition but are instantiated differently across them. For example, the concept of 'worship' applies across multiple religions, but what counts as worship and how it is practised varies enormously between Quaker silence, Pentecostal exuberance, and Orthodox Jewish prayer.

Effective curriculum selection prioritises substantive concepts that have high explanatory power—concepts that illuminate multiple areas of content and that pupils will encounter repeatedly as they progress through the curriculum. Teaching these concepts explicitly, with clear definitions, multiple examples, and opportunities to identify instantiations in new contexts, builds pupils' conceptual understanding and enables them to approach new content with appropriate intellectual tools.

### Disciplinary Knowledge

Alongside substantive knowledge, curriculum selection must address disciplinary knowledge—the understanding of how knowledge about religion is constructed, evaluated, and contested. This includes knowledge of the methods and procedures used in theology, philosophy, and the human/social sciences to investigate religious phenomena.

Prioritising disciplinary knowledge means including content that makes the disciplinary approach visible to pupils. When teaching a theological approach to the resurrection of Jesus, for example, the curriculum should include not just what Christians believe but how theologians reason about this belief—examining biblical sources, considering historical context, engaging with questions of interpretation, and recognising diversity of theological opinion within Christianity.

Similarly, when teaching a social science approach to religious identity, the curriculum should make visible the methods sociologists use—surveys, interviews, ethnographic observation—and the kinds of claims they can and cannot make. This might include considering why census data on religion might differ from survey data, or how the presence of an observer might change religious practice.

### Personal Knowledge and the Development of Religious Literacy

Curriculum selection in RE must also consider personal knowledge—pupils' own experiences, assumptions, and developing worldviews. While RE is not religious instruction and should not seek to promote particular religious or non-religious positions, it cannot ignore the personal dimension of engaging with ultimate questions. The Ofsted research review notes that high-quality RE enables pupils to make sense of their own place in a religiously plural world.

This has implications for content selection. Curricula should include content that speaks to pupils' lived experience and developmental concerns—questions of identity, belonging, meaning, and values that are relevant to their lives. It should include opportunities for pupils to engage personally with the material, not just learn about it at a distance. This might involve structured reflection on how different worldviews address questions pupils find meaningful, or exploration of how religious and non-religious commitments shape people's lives in Britain today.

The concept of religious literacy provides a framework for thinking about what pupils need to know and be able to do. Religiously literate pupils can understand and communicate about religious and non-religious worldviews with accuracy, empathy, and critical awareness. They can recognise religious references in public discourse, engage respectfully with people who hold different views, and make informed decisions about their own developing positions. Curriculum selection should prioritise content that builds this literacy—knowledge that is powerful because it enables pupils to participate fully in a pluralist society.

### Prioritising Depth Over Breadth

A recurring theme in research and guidance on RE curriculum design is the importance of depth over breadth. The Ofsted subject report 'Deep and Meaningful?' (2024) found that where RE was strongest, leaders had made careful decisions about curriculum content, prioritising depth of understanding over superficial coverage.

Prioritising depth means selecting fewer topics and studying them in greater detail. Instead of encountering Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism at a surface level in a single year, pupils might spend a term engaging deeply with one tradition, exploring its diversity, its internal debates, its historical development, and its contemporary expressions. This depth enables pupils to develop what the Ofsted research review calls 'orientative' knowledge—knowledge about the status and perspective of what they are learning that helps them understand how different pieces of knowledge relate to each other.

Depth also enables disciplinary rigour. Genuine engagement with theological, philosophical, or social scientific approaches requires time. A philosophical investigation into the problem of evil cannot be conducted satisfactorily in a single lesson; it requires sustained engagement with arguments, counter-arguments, and the methods of philosophical reasoning. Curriculum selection must allow sufficient time for this depth, which necessarily means excluding content that might be interesting but would detract from the focus required for rigorous study.

## Practical Strategies for Curriculum Selection

### Mapping the Curriculum: Coherence and Progression

Effective curriculum selection requires a holistic view of the curriculum across all key stages. Curriculum leaders should map what is taught when, identifying how knowledge builds cumulatively and how different components of the curriculum relate to each other.

A curriculum map reveals gaps and redundancies. It might show, for example, that pupils encounter the concept of 'karma' in Year 3, Year 5, and Year 8, but with no clear progression in sophistication. Or it might reveal that certain topics—perhaps the Holocaust, or the relationship between science and religion—are never addressed despite their significance. Mapping makes these patterns visible and enables principled decisions about restructuring.

The map should show not just what content is taught but how it is approached. It might use colour-coding to indicate which units take a primarily theological, philosophical, or social scientific approach, ensuring balance across the curriculum. It might identify which Big Ideas are being addressed in each unit, ensuring that all six receive appropriate attention over time.

### Using Threshold Concepts

Threshold concepts are ideas that, once understood, transform the learner's perception of the subject and enable progress to more advanced understanding. In RE, examples might include:

- The recognition that religions are internally diverse, not monolithic
- The understanding that insider and outsider perspectives on religion differ in kind, not just in content
- The appreciation that sacred texts require interpretation and that multiple valid interpretations exist
- The realisation that religious identity is complex and may intersect with other aspects of identity

Curriculum selection should prioritise content that introduces and reinforces these threshold concepts. Once pupils have grasped that religions are internally diverse, for example, they approach all subsequent content with this understanding in mind. This transforms their study of any particular tradition and enables more sophisticated engagement.

### Responding to the Local Context

While the legal framework for RE is national, its local determination means that curriculum selection should respond to the specific context of the school and its community. The local agreed syllabus provides the statutory foundation, but schools have discretion in how they implement it.

The religious and non-religious composition of the school's intake is relevant, though curriculum selection should not be determined solely by demographics. A school with no Muslim pupils still has a responsibility to teach about Islam, preparing all pupils for life in a diverse society. However, the presence of pupils from particular backgrounds might influence which aspects of a tradition are prioritised—ensuring, for example, that the curriculum includes Sikh traditions from the Punjab as well as from the British diaspora if this reflects the school's community.

Local religious communities are resources for curriculum selection. Engagement with local places of worship, religious leaders, and community members can inform curriculum content, ensuring that it reflects lived religion rather than textbook generalisations. SACREs often maintain speakers' forums or networks that can support this engagement.

### Selecting for Representation and Diversity

Curriculum selection must address how religions and worldviews are represented. Traditional RE curricula have often presented religions as unified, static systems of belief, each distinct from the others. Contemporary approaches recognise that this misrepresents the fluid, contested, and interconnected nature of religious life.

Selecting content that represents diversity within traditions is essential. When teaching Christianity, for example, the curriculum should include not just Anglican or Catholic traditions but Pentecostal, Orthodox, Methodist, and independent church expressions. It should recognise the diversity of Christian belief and practice across different ethnic communities in Britain. Similarly, when teaching Islam, the curriculum should represent Sunni and Shia traditions, different legal schools, and the diversity of Muslim practice across the world and within Britain.

Representation also concerns who speaks within the curriculum. Textbooks and resources often present religious content through the voice of external experts rather than believers themselves. Curriculum selection should prioritise sources that include believers' own voices—sacred texts, testimonies, interviews, and creative expressions—enabling pupils to encounter religious worldviews as lived realities rather than abstract systems.

## Assessment and Curriculum Selection

### Aligning Assessment with Curriculum Intent

Curriculum selection and assessment are intimately connected. The decision to include particular content in the curriculum implies that this content is valuable enough to be assessed. Conversely, the forms of assessment used should reflect and reinforce the curriculum's priorities.

If the curriculum prioritises deep conceptual understanding, assessment should examine this understanding rather than superficial recall. Questions that ask pupils to compare how two traditions address a shared human concern assess understanding of both traditions and the capacity to identify thematic connections—higher-order thinking than recall of isolated facts.

Assessment can also inform curriculum selection. Analysis of pupil performance can reveal areas where the curriculum is not achieving its intended aims, prompting reconsideration of content or approach. If pupils consistently struggle to engage philosophically with religious claims, this might indicate that the curriculum needs to include more explicit teaching of philosophical methods and concepts.

### Avoiding Assessment-Driven Curriculum Narrowing

A risk in curriculum selection is allowing assessment requirements to drive content choices in ways that distort educational aims. If assessment focuses primarily on factual recall, there may be pressure to prioritise content that generates easily testable facts—names, dates, practices—at the expense of deeper engagement with meaning and significance.

Effective curriculum selection maintains a clear distinction between the curriculum's educational aims and the mechanisms used to assess them. While assessment is important, it should not determine what is taught. Rather, assessment should be designed to capture the learning that the curriculum values, even when this makes assessment more complex. Assessing pupils' capacity to engage empathetically with a worldview different from their own, or to construct a philosophical argument, is more challenging than marking factual recall—but these are the capabilities that high-quality RE aims to develop.

## Conclusion: Towards Principled Curriculum Selection

Curriculum selection and prioritisation in RE is not a technical exercise of fitting content into time slots. It is a deeply educational task that requires clarity about the purposes of RE, understanding of the subject's disciplinary foundations, and responsiveness to the pupils and communities served.

Effective curriculum selection is principled rather than arbitrary. It can articulate why particular content has been included and why other content has been excluded. It draws upon frameworks such as the Big Ideas or the three disciplines to ensure coherence and breadth. It prioritises depth over superficial coverage, substantive concepts over isolated facts, and disciplinary rigour over descriptive summary.

The challenges of curriculum selection in RE are significant, but so are the opportunities. A well-constructed RE curriculum enables pupils to enter into the rich discourse about religious and non-religious traditions that shapes human experience. It prepares them to participate thoughtfully and respectfully in a pluralist society, equipped with knowledge, understanding, and the capacity to continue learning throughout their lives.

Curriculum selection is ultimately an expression of what a school believes is most worth knowing in this complex and contested field. By approaching it with rigour, imagination, and a clear sense of educational purpose, RE teachers and curriculum leaders can create curricula that do justice to the subject's importance and to the pupils they serve.
