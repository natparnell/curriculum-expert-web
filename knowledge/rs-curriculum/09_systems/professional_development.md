# Professional Development in Religious Education

## Introduction: The Professional Development Landscape for RE Teachers

Professional development in Religious Education (RE) operates within a distinctive landscape characterised by unique challenges and opportunities. Unlike core subjects such as mathematics or English, RE faces systemic issues including teacher shortages, high rates of non-specialist teaching, and variable access to subject-specific continuing professional development (CPD). This article examines the current state of professional development for RE teachers in the United Kingdom, exploring effective CPD models and addressing the critical distinction between subject-specific and generic training approaches.

The importance of high-quality professional development for RE teachers cannot be overstated. As the RE:ONLINE initiative notes, CPD is "an entitlement of all teachers of RE" and represents a statutory requirement under teachers' conditions of service, which mandate five additional days devoted to in-service education and training. However, the reality of accessing meaningful, subject-specific professional development varies considerably across schools and regions.

## The Current Landscape: Challenges and Realities

### The RE Teacher Shortage Crisis

The professional development landscape for RE must be understood against the backdrop of a significant teacher shortage in the subject. According to data from the Religion Media Centre (2023), 25 per cent of all RE lessons in England are taught by teachers with no post A-level qualification in the subject. Furthermore, 51 per cent of RE teachers are primarily focused on teaching another subject, with RE representing a secondary or even tertiary teaching responsibility.

This shortage has profound implications for professional development. Non-specialist teachers, often teaching RE out of timetable necessity rather than expertise or interest, frequently lack the foundational subject knowledge required to engage meaningfully with advanced CPD. As one commentator noted, the Department for Education supports some subjects with bursaries and initiatives costing millions of pounds, yet RE—despite its importance for religious literacy and inter-faith cohesion—receives no comparable investment.

### The Role of SACREs and Local Support

Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education (SACREs) play a crucial role in supporting RE professional development at the local level. However, the quality and extent of SACRE provision varies considerably across local authorities. Some SACREs offer extensive CPD programmes, whilst others provide minimal support. This postcode lottery effect means that teachers' access to professional development often depends more on geographical location than on individual need or school priority.

The local dimension of RE support extends beyond SACREs to include teacher-led networks and professional communities. NATRE local groups, for instance, provide peer support and development opportunities across England, meeting in schools, coffee shops, or CPD centres with support from NATRE, RE Today Services, and occasionally Culham St Gabriel's Trust.

### University-Based Initial Teacher Education

Initial teacher education for RE continues to be offered by several universities, including the University of Birmingham, Cambridge, and Leeds Trinity. These programmes provide comprehensive preparation for specialist RE teachers, covering lesson planning, devising learning activities, questioning techniques, dialogic methods, and behaviour for learning strategies.

However, the number of trainees entering RE initial teacher education remains insufficient to meet demand. This shortfall perpetuates the reliance on non-specialists and creates ongoing pressure on the professional development system to upskill teachers who may have received little or no formal RE training.

## Subject-Specific Versus Generic CPD: The Evidence Base

### The Case for Subject-Specific Professional Development

A substantial and growing body of evidence demonstrates that subject-specific CPD is more effective than generic pedagogic training. The Wellcome Trust's influential 2015 report "Developing Great Subject Teaching," conducted by Cordingley, Higgins, and Greany, found that sustained subject-specific CPD has a greater impact on pupil outcomes than one-off generic pedagogic activities.

Robert Coe (2020), writing for the Institute of Physics, argues that "investing in systemic, high-quality CPD is probably one of the most evidence-based and cost-effective things we could do to raise attainment." This argument is particularly pertinent for RE, where subject knowledge encompasses not only religious traditions and non-religious worldviews but also complex philosophical, theological, and sociological perspectives.

Teachers themselves report finding subject-specific CPD more beneficial. The DfE's Independent Review of Teachers' Professional Development in Schools: Phase 1 Findings (May 2024) noted that teachers "generally discussed the content in terms of improving subject-specific knowledge rather than generic concepts." This teacher preference aligns with research evidence on effectiveness.

### The Limitations of Generic CPD

Generic CPD, whilst potentially useful for developing general pedagogic skills, often fails to address the specific knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge required for effective RE teaching. The Bradford Research School (2021) identifies tensions between generic and subject-specific approaches, noting that effective generic CPD might focus on areas such as effective modelling or metacognition, but without subject contextualisation, such training risks remaining abstract and unimplementable.

For RE specifically, generic training on questioning techniques, for example, may not address the distinctive nature of theological enquiry, the handling of controversial issues, or the facilitation of discussions about beliefs and practices that differ from pupils' own experiences. Subject-specific CPD, by contrast, embeds pedagogical development within authentic RE contexts.

### The Teacher Development Trust Perspective

The Teacher Development Trust (TDT) has been vocal in highlighting the limitations of traditional CPD models. Their research, conducted in collaboration with CUREE and academics from Durham University and UCL, found that "generic, 'one size fits no-one' CPD" is ineffective. Instead, they advocate for professional learning that is "sustained, evidence-rich, collaborative" and focused on teachers' aspirations for their learners.

TDT emphasises the importance of building assessment for learning for teachers into the design of CPD at every stage, enabling practitioners to contextualise new approaches for their subjects and pupils. This principle is especially relevant for RE, where teachers must navigate complex materials, diverse pupil backgrounds, and sensitive topics.

## Effective CPD Models for RE

### The RE Hub and NATRE Model

The National Association of Teachers of RE (NATRE) provides a focal point for RE professional development, offering publications, courses, and a representative voice at the national level. NATRE's CPD provision includes:

- **StrictlyRE@Home**: An online platform offering classroom resources, CPD courses, and webinars indexed by major world faiths and non-religious worldviews
- **Local groups**: Teacher-led networks meeting regularly to share practice and develop subject knowledge
- **Monthly webinars**: Free sessions designed explicitly to support teachers in developing their teaching abilities and subject knowledge, particularly aimed at Early Career Teachers and those new to teaching or leading RE

### RE Today Services

RE Today Services regularly provides face-to-face CPD and high-quality webinars tailored for both primary and secondary teachers of RE. Their provision is explicitly subject-specific, addressing topics such as curriculum development, assessment in RE, and teaching about specific religious traditions or worldviews.

The RE Today and NATRE "Project for Excellent RE" offers 3½ days of high-quality, practical, and inspirational CPD with a focus on supporting RE as a lead subject in school improvement, SMSCD (Spiritual, Moral, Social and Cultural Development), and British Values across the school.

### Culham St Gabriel's and Teach:RE

Culham St Gabriel's Trust, an endowed charitable trust dedicated to educational work in support of religious education, offers the Teach:RE programme. This initiative provides:

- Accredited courses at Certificate, Diploma, and Masters levels
- Short courses for developing subject knowledge
- Resources to help plug gaps or extend subject knowledge

All Teach:RE courses are endorsed and certified by NATRE, ensuring quality and recognition within the RE professional community.

### RE:ONLINE Professional Development

RE:ONLINE, funded by Culham St Gabriel's, provides interactive short courses designed for teachers to introduce current thinking in the field. These courses are particularly valuable for time-pressed practitioners who need flexible, self-paced development opportunities. The platform also offers a free self-study module on "Religion and Worldviews: Developing subject knowledge for teaching."

### The Chartered College of Teaching Approach

The Chartered College of Research emphasises that CPD programmes should be informed by what we know about effective approaches to teacher development: close to classroom practice, with opportunities for peer learning and implementation. For RE, this might involve:

- Lesson study approaches focusing on specific RE pedagogies
- Collaborative planning and review of enquiries or units
- Peer observation focused on subject-specific teaching moves
- Action research projects investigating aspects of RE practice

## Key Principles for Effective RE CPD

### Sustained Engagement Over One-Off Events

The evidence consistently shows that effective professional development is sustained over time rather than delivered through isolated one-day courses. For RE teachers, particularly non-specialists, this might involve:

- Term-long or year-long programmes building subject knowledge progressively
- Regular network meetings providing ongoing support and challenge
- Online communities enabling continuous professional dialogue

### Active and Collaborative Learning

Effective CPD engages teachers as active learners rather than passive recipients. This principle applies equally to RE professional development, where approaches might include:

- Collaborative resource development
- Peer mentoring between specialist and non-specialist colleagues
- Professional learning communities focused on specific aspects of RE practice
- Joint practice development between schools

### Focus on Pedagogical Content Knowledge

RE teaching requires distinctive pedagogical content knowledge—understanding not just what to teach (subject knowledge) and how to teach generally (pedagogic knowledge), but how to teach RE specifically. Effective CPD addresses this intersection, covering areas such as:

- Facilitating theological and philosophical enquiry
- Handling controversial issues and diverse viewpoints
- Using sacred texts and artefacts appropriately and effectively
- Developing pupils' religious literacy and worldview literacy
- Assessment approaches that capture progress in complex learning domains

### Contextualisation and Implementation Support

Professional development is most effective when it supports teachers in implementing new approaches in their specific contexts. For RE, this might involve:

- Support for adapting national resources to local agreed syllabus requirements
- Guidance on meeting the needs of diverse pupil populations
- Practical strategies for managing sensitive discussions
- Approaches to working with limited curriculum time or resources

## Addressing the Non-Specialist Challenge

### Support for Non-Specialist Teachers

Given that over half of RE teachers are non-specialists, effective professional development must address their specific needs. NATRE provides guidance on "Nine ways to support a new primary beginner teacher in Religious Education / Religion and Worldviews," emphasising strategies such as:

- Encouraging completion of CPD to develop RE subject knowledge
- Providing access to high-quality resources and planning support
- Creating opportunities for collaborative working with specialist colleagues

### The Role of Subject Leaders

RE subject leaders play a crucial role in mediating professional development for their colleagues. NATRE offers specific guidance on "Disseminating Training to Other Staff for RE Subject Leaders," recognising that subject leaders often need to translate external CPD into actionable support for non-specialist teachers.

## System-Level Considerations

### Ofsted and Professional Development

Ofsted's inspection framework recognises the importance of professional development in securing the quality of education. Helen Matthews, Senior HMI for Teacher Development, has written about Ofsted's role in quality assuring national professional qualifications and the Early Career Framework. Schools' CPD provision is evaluated as part of leadership and management judgments, with inspectors considering whether professional development is aligned with curriculum priorities and supports teachers in implementing the intended curriculum.

For RE, this creates both opportunity and pressure. Where schools priorities RE within their curriculum, professional development is likely to be well-resourced and aligned. Where RE is marginalised, CPD provision may be inadequate.

### The DfE Independent Review

The Department for Education's Independent Review of Teachers' Professional Development in Schools (2024) found that schools understand the importance of professional development but face challenges in finding time due to competing priorities. The review noted that curriculum training was highlighted regularly in both survey responses and research visits, suggesting that subject-specific development is increasingly valued.

However, the review also identified workload as a significant barrier to professional development, with teachers struggling to find time for CPD alongside their other responsibilities. This finding has particular relevance for RE, where non-specialist teachers may already feel overwhelmed by teaching outside their expertise.

## Future Directions

### The Religion and Worldviews Transition

The proposed transition from Religious Education to Religion and Worldviews represents a significant development that will have implications for professional development. Teachers will need support to understand and implement the new approach, which places greater emphasis on the academic study of religion and worldviews as part of a well-rounded education.

Professional development providers, including NATRE, RE Today, and Culham St Gabriel's, are already developing resources and courses to support this transition. The extent to which schools invest in this CPD will significantly influence the success of the reform.

### Technology-Enhanced Professional Learning

The growth of online and blended professional development offers opportunities to overcome geographical and temporal barriers to RE CPD. Platforms such as StrictlyRE@Home and RE:ONLINE demonstrate the potential for technology to provide flexible, accessible professional learning. Future developments might include:

- Virtual reality environments for exploring religious sites and practices
- AI-supported personalisation of CPD pathways
- Expanded webinar and online course provision
- Digital communities of practice connecting RE teachers nationally and internationally

### Research-Informed Practice

The RE professional development landscape is increasingly informed by research evidence. The Religion and Worldviews Research Programme, the National Institute for Christian Education Research at Canterbury Christ Church University, and other research centres contribute to an evidence base that can guide effective CPD design. Future professional development should be increasingly explicit about its research foundations, helping teachers become informed consumers of educational research.

## Conclusion

Professional development in Religious Education operates within a challenging context of teacher shortages, non-specialist teaching, and variable local support. However, a range of effective CPD models exists, provided by organisations including NATRE, RE Today, Culham St Gabriel's Trust, and various universities.

The evidence is clear that subject-specific CPD is more effective than generic training, and this principle should guide both the design of professional development programmes and the choices made by individual teachers and school leaders. Sustained, collaborative, and practice-focused professional learning offers the greatest potential for improving RE teaching and, consequently, pupil outcomes.

Addressing the professional development needs of the RE teaching workforce—particularly the substantial proportion of non-specialists—requires sustained investment and strategic coordination. SACREs, initial teacher education providers, CPD organisations, and school leaders all have roles to play in ensuring that every RE teacher, regardless of background or experience, has access to high-quality, subject-specific professional development.

As the subject potentially transitions to Religion and Worldviews, the importance of effective professional development becomes even more pronounced. The success of curriculum reform depends fundamentally on the capacity of teachers to implement new approaches, and this capacity is built through well-designed, evidence-informed professional learning. The investment in RE CPD is, ultimately, an investment in the quality of education that pupils receive in this vital subject.
