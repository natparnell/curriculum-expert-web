# Assessment of Substance in Religious Education

## Introduction: Why Assessment of Substance Matters

Assessment in religious education (RE) has long been a contested and often misunderstood domain. Unlike subjects with clearly defined examination specifications, RE assessment must navigate three distinct forms of knowledge—substantive, disciplinary, and personal—whilst avoiding the trap of premature examination focus that has plagued secondary provision. Ofsted's 2024 subject report "Deep and Meaningful?" identified that assessment frequently fails to check pupils' substantive and disciplinary knowledge specifically, with many primary schools relying on generic whole-school assessment systems rather than subject-specific approaches.

The assessment of substance requires teachers to distinguish carefully between what pupils know (substantive knowledge), how they know it (disciplinary knowledge), and what they believe (personal knowledge). This distinction is not merely academic—it fundamentally shapes curriculum design, pedagogy, and the validity of assessment itself. When assessment conflates these categories or focuses disproportionately on examination techniques at the expense of genuine understanding, pupils leave school with scant subject knowledge and limited capacity to engage meaningfully with religious and non-religious worldviews.

This knowledge file explores the theoretical foundations of assessment in RE, practical strategies for assessing substantive and disciplinary knowledge distinctly, and approaches for avoiding the premature narrowing that examination specifications can impose. It draws upon Ofsted's research reviews, the Religious Education Council's guidance, and emerging best practice from schools that have developed coherent assessment systems aligned with the three forms of knowledge.

## The Three Forms of Knowledge and Their Assessment Implications

### Substantive Knowledge: The Content of RE

Substantive knowledge in RE comprises the beliefs, practices, teachings, texts, and phenomena associated with religious and non-religious traditions. As one curriculum lead memorably characterised it, this is "the stuff"—the actual content that pupils learn about Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, Sikhism, Buddhism, and humanist or other non-religious worldviews. Ofsted's 2021 research review emphasised that this knowledge should not be confused with "mere facts" but represents powerful knowledge that enables pupils to understand the complexity and diversity of global religion and non-religion.

Assessing substantive knowledge requires clarity about what constitutes valid claims within the domain. When pupils state that "Christians believe Jesus is the Son of God" or "Humanists reject supernatural explanations," they are making substantive claims that can be evaluated against the teachings and practices of actual religious and non-religious communities. Assessment should focus on the accuracy, breadth, and depth of this knowledge—whether pupils can recall core teachings, explain practices in context, and recognise diversity within traditions.

However, substantive knowledge assessment must avoid several pitfalls. First, it should not reduce complex traditions to simplistic checklists of beliefs. Second, it must recognise that substantive knowledge includes not only propositional claims but also narrative knowledge (sacred stories, biographies of significant figures), procedural knowledge (how rituals are performed, how texts are interpreted), and contextual knowledge (how beliefs and practices vary across time, place, and culture). Third, assessment must distinguish between knowledge about religion and knowledge of religion—the former being external descriptions, the latter including insider perspectives and meanings.

### Disciplinary Knowledge: Ways of Knowing in RE

Disciplinary knowledge in RE refers to the methods, questions, and approaches through which substantive knowledge is generated, evaluated, and interpreted. Ofsted's research review described disciplinary knowledge as "knowledge that acts on substantive knowledge, as well as the products generated by that action." In practice, this encompasses the disciplinary lenses through which pupils engage with religious and non-religious content—most commonly theology, philosophy, and the human/social sciences.

Assessing disciplinary knowledge requires different approaches from substantive knowledge assessment. While substantive assessment asks "What do religious traditions teach about this?", disciplinary assessment asks "How would a theologian/philosopher/social scientist approach this question?" The focus shifts from content recall to understanding methodological approaches, recognising disciplinary boundaries, and applying appropriate analytical frameworks.

In primary RE, disciplinary knowledge might be assessed through pupils' capacity to ask different kinds of questions about a religious story—phenomenological questions about what happens, theological questions about what believers think it means, or philosophical questions about whether the events described are possible or plausible. In secondary RE, disciplinary assessment becomes more explicit, evaluating whether pupils can distinguish theological arguments from sociological analysis, recognise the assumptions underlying different approaches, and apply disciplinary methods appropriately.

The curriculum model developed by the Religious Education Council and the National Association of Teachers of RE (NATRE) deliberately plans for both substantive and disciplinary knowledge to be taught and for students to knowingly use the disciplines in their learning. How structured the disciplinary skills are taught can vary, but assessment should make visible the disciplinary moves pupils are making.

### Personal Knowledge: Individual Worldview Development

Personal knowledge in RE refers to pupils' growing awareness of their own worldview and the ways in which it impacts their engagement with religious and non-religious content. This includes their beliefs, values, commitments, and sense of identity. Ofsted's 2024 subject report raised a crucial question about personal knowledge: "due to its highly personal nature, might be an aspect of RE that should be unencumbered by assessment."

This question strikes at the heart of RE's distinctive character. Unlike substantive and disciplinary knowledge, personal knowledge is not primarily about correctness or accuracy but about self-awareness, reflection, and development. Assessment of personal knowledge risks instrumentalising pupils' inner lives, creating performative expectations around belief disclosure, or privileging certain types of worldview development over others.

However, this does not mean personal knowledge should be ignored in assessment. Rather, assessment might focus on pupils' capacity to articulate their own perspective, recognise how their background shapes their understanding, and engage respectfully with views different from their own. Some schools assess personal knowledge through reflective journals or portfolios where pupils trace their own thinking over time. The key principle is that such assessment should be formative and developmental rather than summative and judgmental.

## Distinguishing Substantive from Disciplinary Assessment

### Recognition Tasks vs. Application Tasks

A fundamental distinction in RE assessment lies between recognition tasks and application tasks. Recognition tasks assess whether pupils can identify or recall substantive content—naming the Five Pillars of Islam, identifying key events in the life of the Buddha, or recognising the authority of the Torah in Judaism. These are necessary but insufficient assessments of RE learning.

Application tasks require pupils to use disciplinary approaches to engage with substantive content. For example, rather than simply identifying Christian teachings about the resurrection, pupils might be asked to analyse the theological significance of resurrection claims, evaluate philosophical arguments for and against bodily resurrection, or examine sociological explanations for belief in resurrection. Each of these tasks requires both substantive knowledge (what Christians believe) and disciplinary application (how theologians, philosophers, or sociologists engage with this belief).

Effective RE assessment sequences these task types carefully. Early in a unit, recognition tasks establish foundational substantive knowledge. As the unit progresses, application tasks increasingly dominate, requiring pupils to deploy disciplinary approaches to interpret and analyse content. This progression mirrors the relationship between substantive and disciplinary knowledge—disciplinary approaches require substantive content to work with, but substantive content gains meaning through disciplinary engagement.

### Assessing Disciplinary Moves Explicitly

Research into disciplinary literacy suggests that pupils develop disciplinary competence when they are explicitly taught the moves that characterise each discipline. In RE, this means making visible the questions, methods, and conventions of theology, philosophy, and the human/social sciences.

Assessment can make disciplinary moves explicit through several strategies. First, assessment rubrics can separate substantive criteria (accuracy of content knowledge) from disciplinary criteria (appropriate use of theological/philosophical/social scientific reasoning). Second, task instructions can signal the disciplinary lens explicitly—"From a sociological perspective, how might we explain...?" or "What theological questions arise from...?" Third, pupils can be asked to meta-comment on their own work, identifying which disciplinary approaches they have used and why.

The "ways of knowing" framework developed by the Religious Education Council provides a structure for assessing disciplinary knowledge across key stages. At key stage 1, pupils might begin to distinguish between what religious people believe (substantive) and how we find out about religion (disciplinary foundations). By key stage 3, assessment can evaluate pupils' capacity to sustain disciplined enquiry, applying consistent methodological approaches to complex questions. At key stage 4 and beyond, assessment can examine whether pupils can select appropriate disciplines for different questions and synthesise insights from multiple disciplinary perspectives.

### Common Assessment Pitfalls

Several common pitfalls undermine the assessment of substance in RE. The first is the conflation of substantive and personal knowledge—assessing pupils on whether they agree with religious teachings or find them personally meaningful. This confuses education about religion with religious nurture and creates assessment that is inherently unfair to pupils from non-religious backgrounds or minority religious traditions.

The second pitfall is treating disciplinary knowledge as generic "critical thinking" rather than specific methodological approaches. Pupils are asked to "evaluate" or "analyse" without being taught what theological evaluation or philosophical analysis actually entail. Assessment then becomes arbitrary, rewarding confident expression over disciplined reasoning.

The third pitfall is focusing assessment on written outputs that privilege linguistic facility over religious understanding. While written assessment has its place, RE knowledge includes visual, embodied, and practical understanding—knowing what a mandala looks like, understanding how salah is performed, or recognising the emotional tone of a religious text. Assessment that relies solely on extended writing may miss significant aspects of pupils' religious literacy.

The fourth pitfall—and perhaps the most pervasive in secondary schools—is the premature focus on examination assessment formats. When pupils spend significant time practising 4-mark, 8-mark, or 12-mark examination questions, assessment shifts from checking understanding of RE content to checking examination technique. This is the subject of the following section.

## Avoiding Premature Exam Focus

### The Problem of Teaching to the Test

Ofsted's 2024 subject report identified that "the content of some secondary curriculums was restricted by what teachers considered pupils needed to know for public examinations at the end of key stage 4. In a significant number of cases, teachers taught examination skills too prematurely. This significantly limited the range and types of RE content taught." This finding echoes broader research on assessment in English schools, where "teaching to the test" has become recognised as a systemic problem distorting curriculum and pedagogy.

Teaching to the test in RE manifests in several ways. Curriculum time in key stage 3—when RE should be building broad substantive knowledge and introducing disciplinary approaches—is devoted to GCSE-style assessment practice. Pupils learn formulaic structures for answering examination questions before they have developed the underlying understanding that would make such answers meaningful. Topics not assessed in GCSE specifications are omitted or marginalised, creating gaps in pupils' religious literacy.

The consequences extend beyond content coverage. When assessment focuses prematurely on examination technique, pupils learn that RE is about producing acceptable answers rather than exploring genuine questions. The discipline becomes instrumental—a means to examination success rather than a domain of enquiry worth pursuing for its own sake. This undermines both the intrinsic value of RE and its capacity to contribute to pupils' personal development.

### The Distinction Between Teaching to the Test and Teaching for the Test

A helpful distinction exists between "teaching to the test" and "teaching for the test." Teaching to the test involves narrow focus on examination formats, question types, and mark schemes at the expense of broader subject learning. Teaching for the test involves building secure subject knowledge and disciplinary competence that will enable examination success without distorting the curriculum.

Teaching for the test in RE means ensuring that by the time pupils reach key stage 4, they have broad substantive knowledge across multiple religious and non-religious traditions, developed capacity in theological, philosophical, and social scientific reasoning, and can apply these understandings to unfamiliar questions and contexts. When pupils have this foundation, examination preparation becomes a relatively brief process of familiarisation with assessment formats rather than a multi-year narrowing of the curriculum.

Assessment in key stage 3 should therefore focus on building the knowledge and capabilities that will underpin future examination success without mimicking examination formats. This might include assessing pupils' capacity to explain complex beliefs accurately, engage with primary religious texts, compare and contrast different worldviews, and sustain extended reasoning about contested questions. These capabilities align with GCSE assessment objectives but are developed through rich curriculum engagement rather than practice papers.

### Strategies for Maintaining Curriculum Breadth

Schools that have successfully resisted premature examination focus employ several strategies. First, they protect key stage 3 curriculum time, ensuring that RE in years 7-9 covers content beyond the GCSE specification. This might include deeper study of traditions not examined at GCSE, exploration of topics that provide important context for examined content, or extended engagement with disciplinary approaches.

Second, they design key stage 3 assessment that differs significantly from GCSE formats. Rather than 4-mark, 8-mark, and 12-mark questions, they might use essays, projects, presentations, or extended enquiries that assess understanding without mimicking examination conditions. This makes it easier to distinguish between subject learning and examination preparation.

Third, they sequence examination preparation carefully, introducing it only when pupils have secure foundational knowledge. Rather than beginning GCSE-style assessment in year 7 or 8, they might wait until year 10, trusting that rich curriculum engagement will provide better preparation than extended practice with examination formats.

Fourth, they ensure that assessment at all key stages checks understanding of RE content rather than just technique. Even when using examination-style questions, they focus on whether pupils' answers demonstrate genuine understanding of religious and non-religious traditions, not just whether they follow the expected structure.

## Practical Assessment Strategies for Different Forms of Knowledge

### Assessing Substantive Knowledge

Effective assessment of substantive knowledge in RE requires attention to different types of content knowledge. Propositional knowledge—statements of belief and doctrine—can be assessed through carefully constructed questions that check understanding rather than just recall. For example, rather than asking "What do Muslims believe about the Qur'an?" (which could be answered from a single sentence), a question might ask "How do Muslim beliefs about the Qur'an as revelation shape how they treat and use the text?" This requires not just recall of the belief but understanding of its implications.

Narrative knowledge—knowledge of sacred stories and significant events—can be assessed through sequencing tasks, retelling with emphasis on significance, or analysis of how narratives function within traditions. Procedural knowledge—how practices are performed—can be assessed through description, visual representation, or (where appropriate) demonstration. Contextual knowledge—understanding how beliefs and practices vary—can be assessed through comparison tasks or case study analysis.

Formative assessment of substantive knowledge can employ strategies like retrieval practice, low-stakes quizzing, and knowledge organisers. The key is ensuring that these assessments check genuine understanding rather than superficial memorisation. For example, a knowledge organiser might include not just key terms but how they relate to each other, or not just beliefs but the evidence and reasoning that support them within a tradition.

### Assessing Disciplinary Knowledge

Assessing disciplinary knowledge requires making the disciplines visible in assessment tasks. One effective approach is to use "discipline markers"—explicit signals in task instructions that indicate which disciplinary approach is required. For example:

- Theological: "From a Christian theological perspective, how might one interpret...?"
- Philosophical: "What philosophical arguments could be offered for and against...?"
- Phenomenological: "How might a religious studies scholar describe... without making truth claims?"
- Sociological: "What sociological factors might explain why...?"

Assessment rubrics for disciplinary tasks should include criteria specific to each discipline. Theological reasoning might be assessed on its fidelity to the tradition being examined, its use of appropriate sources and authorities, and its coherence with the tradition's broader theological framework. Philosophical reasoning might be assessed on clarity of argument, recognition of counter-arguments, and logical validity. Sociological analysis might be assessed on its use of appropriate concepts, recognition of multiple causation, and avoidance of reductionism.

Pupils can also be assessed on their capacity to select appropriate disciplines for different questions, to recognise the limitations of each discipline, and to synthesise insights from multiple disciplinary perspectives. This higher-order disciplinary competence is particularly important at key stage 4 and beyond.

### Assessing Personal Knowledge

As noted above, personal knowledge presents particular assessment challenges. Some schools choose not to assess personal knowledge summatively, recognising its private and developmental nature. Others use formative approaches that support reflection without creating pressure to perform particular types of belief or self-understanding.

Where personal knowledge is assessed, it should focus on process rather than content—pupils' capacity to articulate their thinking, recognise influences on their perspective, engage respectfully with alternatives, and demonstrate openness to change. Assessment might take the form of reflective journals, portfolios tracing thinking over time, or structured discussions where pupils articulate and respond to different viewpoints.

It is crucial that assessment of personal knowledge does not privilege particular worldviews. Assessment criteria should not reward religious belief over non-religious positions, or vice versa. The focus should be on the quality of reflection and engagement rather than the content of pupils' conclusions.

## Assessment Systems and Subject-Specific Approaches

### Moving Beyond Generic Assessment Systems

Ofsted's 2024 subject report noted that "the primary schools sampled used whole-school assessment systems rather than assessment designed to specifically check pupils' substantive and disciplinary knowledge in RE." This finding highlights a systemic problem: many schools use generic assessment frameworks that fail to capture the distinctive character of different subjects.

Generic assessment systems typically focus on generic skills—communication, analysis, evaluation—without specifying what these look like in particular subjects. In RE, this can lead to assessment that values confident expression over accurate understanding, or that fails to distinguish between different forms of knowledge. A pupil might receive high marks for a well-structured response that misrepresents religious beliefs, or low marks for an awkwardly expressed but theologically insightful contribution.

Subject-specific assessment in RE requires systems that recognise the distinctiveness of substantive, disciplinary, and personal knowledge. This might involve separate assessment strands for each form of knowledge, or assessment criteria that explicitly reference RE content. It certainly requires assessment literacy among teachers, who need to understand the three forms of knowledge and how they manifest in pupils' work.

### Developing Assessment Literacy

Assessment literacy in RE involves understanding not just what to assess but how assessment functions within the subject. Teachers need to understand the relationship between substantive and disciplinary knowledge, the distinctive features of theological, philosophical, and social scientific reasoning, and the particular challenges of assessing personal knowledge.

Professional development for RE assessment should include engagement with the three forms of knowledge framework, analysis of pupil work that exemplifies different forms of knowledge, and collaborative development of assessment tasks and rubrics. The Religious Education Council and NATRE provide resources supporting this work, including guidance on assessing different forms of knowledge and exemplar assessment materials.

Moderation is crucial for developing shared understanding of assessment standards.
