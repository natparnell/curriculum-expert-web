# GCSE Religious Studies Specifications: AQA, Edexcel, OCR, and WJEC Eduqas Comparison

## Overview

GCSE Religious Studies (RS) in England is offered by four main awarding bodies: AQA, Pearson Edexcel, OCR, and WJEC Eduqas. Each specification shares common features mandated by the Department for Education (DfE) and Ofqual, including the study of two religions and engagement with philosophical and ethical themes. However, significant differences exist in structure, content weighting, assessment approaches, and available religion options. Understanding these distinctions is essential for curriculum leaders when selecting a specification that aligns with their school's expertise, student cohort, and overall educational aims.

## Regulatory Framework and Common Requirements

### Statutory Requirements

All GCSE RS specifications must comply with the DfE's subject content requirements published in 2015. These mandate that students must:

- Study the beliefs, teachings, and practices of two religions
- Study philosophical and ethical themes from religious and non-religious perspectives
- Engage with textual sources of wisdom and authority
- Develop understanding of the impact of beliefs on individuals, communities, and societies

### Assessment Objectives

All four exam boards use the same two assessment objectives (AOs) established by Ofqual:

#### AO1: Knowledge and Understanding

Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of religion and beliefs, including:
- Religious, philosophical, and/or ethical thought and teaching
- Influence of beliefs, teachings, and practices on individuals, communities, and societies
- Cause and significance of similarities and differences in belief and practice

#### AO2: Analysis and Evaluation

Analyse and evaluate aspects of religion and belief, including their significance and influence. This includes:
- Constructing reasoned arguments
- Making substantiated judgements
- Evaluating different perspectives on philosophical and ethical issues

The weighting of these AOs varies slightly between specifications, with most awarding approximately 50% to each objective, reflecting the dual demand of content knowledge and evaluative skill.

## AQA GCSE Religious Studies

### Structure and Routes

AQA offers two distinct specifications:

## Pedagogical Considerations

### Selecting a Specification

When choosing between specifications, curriculum leaders should consider:

#### Staff Expertise
- Match religion choices to teacher specialisms
- Consider training needs for unfamiliar content
- Evaluate availability of subject-specific CPD

#### Student Background
- Reflect local community religious demographics
- Consider prior learning from KS3
- Account for student interest in particular themes

#### School Context
- Faith schools may prefer specifications with their tradition emphasised
- Consider alignment with school's ethos and values
- Evaluate resources and textbooks available

#### Assessment Approach
- Review sample assessment materials for question style
- Consider familiarity with board's approach from other subjects
- Evaluate quality and availability of exemplar materials

### Teaching Approaches Across Specifications

Regardless of chosen specification, effective GCSE RS teaching should:

#### Develop Textual Literacy
- Regular engagement with sacred texts and sources of wisdom
- Teaching students to cite and interpret scriptural references
- Building confidence with religious terminology

#### Build Evaluation Skills
- Structured frameworks for analysis (PEEL, PETER paragraphs)
- Regular practice of 12-mark and 15-mark responses
- Development of balanced argument construction

#### Address Common Misconceptions
- Challenge stereotypes about religious communities
- Distinguish between cultural practices and religious teachings
- Address oversimplification of complex theological positions

#### Support Differentiation
- Scaffold extended writing for lower-attaining students
- Stretch higher-attaining students with scholarly perspectives
- Provide targeted intervention based on mock performance

## Resources and Support

### Textbooks and Published Materials

All major publishers produce textbooks aligned to each specification:
- Oxford University Press
- Hodder Education
- Illuminate Publishing (particularly strong for Eduqas)
- Pearson (Edexcel-specific)

When selecting textbooks, consider:
- Alignment to specification content statements
- Quality of assessment practice questions
- Inclusion of scholarly and contemporary sources
- Clarity of layout and accessibility for students

- **Religious education council**: Curriculum guidance and updates

## Recent Developments and Future Considerations

### Specification Review Cycles

All current GCSE RS specifications were first taught in 2016 and are not scheduled for immediate reform. However, curriculum leaders should monitor:

- Ofqual announcements regarding subject content review
- DfE consultations on religious education
- Exam board updates to specifications or sample assessments
- Changes to accountability measures affecting RS uptake

### Progression to A-Level

Consider alignment between GCSE and A-Level RS:
- AQA GCSE A maps well to AQA A-Level
- OCR GCSE provides strong foundation for OCR A-Level
- Eduqas GCSE prepares students for Eduqas A-Level
- Some themes and content overlap support progression

### EBacc and Progress 8

GCSE RS sits outside the EBacc suite but counts in Progress 8:
- Open slot qualification contributing to overall attainment
- Popular choice for students not taking History or Geography
- Can contribute to English Baccalaureate through humanities slot in some interpretations

## Conclusion

All four exam boards offer robust GCSE Religious Studies specifications that meet statutory requirements and provide students with valuable knowledge and skills. The choice between them should reflect school context, staff expertise, and intended student outcomes rather than inherent quality differences.

Key decision factors include:
- **Religion choice flexibility**: AQA Specification A offers the widest range; AQA B is most restricted
- **Catholic provision**: Eduqas Route B provides the most substantial Catholic content
- **Non-religious perspectives**: OCR builds these in most explicitly
- **Assessment structure**: AQA and Edexcel use two papers; OCR and Eduqas use three
- **Resources**: Consider textbook quality and availability of supporting materials

Ultimately, the specification is a vehicle for delivering high-quality religious education that develops students' understanding of religious and non-religious worldviews, their ability to
