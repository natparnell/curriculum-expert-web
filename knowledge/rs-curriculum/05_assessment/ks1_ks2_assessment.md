# KS1 and KS2 Assessment in Religious Education

## Introduction: The Assessment Landscape in Primary RE

Assessment in primary Religious Education (RE) operates within a distinctive policy context that distinguishes it from other National Curriculum subjects. While RE is a statutory subject for all registered pupils in maintained schools, it does not form part of the 2014 National Curriculum. Instead, it is determined locally through Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education (SACREs) and their agreed syllabuses. This local determination creates both opportunities and challenges for assessment practice, particularly following the removal of National Curriculum levels in 2014.

The non-statutory guidance for RE (DfE, updated September 2023) establishes that schools should assess RE effectively, tracking pupils' progress and providing meaningful information to parents and carers. However, unlike English and mathematics, there are no national assessment requirements or standardised tests at Key Stage 1 or Key Stage 2. This freedom has led to the development of diverse assessment approaches across different local authorities, with some common patterns emerging from agreed syllabuses and resources such as Understanding Christianity.

This knowledge file examines the frameworks, principles, and practical approaches to assessment in primary RE, with particular attention to progression frameworks derived from agreed syllabuses and the transition to assessment without levels.

## The Statutory and Non-Statutory Framework

### Legal Requirements for RE Assessment

The Education Act 1996 and the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 establish the statutory basis for Religious Education in maintained schools. The Education Act 2002 reinforces this position, requiring every maintained school in England to teach RE to all registered pupils. While the content of RE is determined locally through the agreed syllabus, the duty to assess pupils' progress is implicit in the broader statutory requirement to provide a curriculum that meets pupils' needs and enables them to achieve.

The non-statutory guidance for RE (published January 2010, replacing Circular 1/94, and updated in September 2023) clarifies that assessment in RE should:

- Be an integral part of the teaching and learning process
- Focus on what pupils know, understand, and can do
- Provide information that informs future planning and teaching
- Enable pupils to demonstrate their learning and reflect on their progress
- Communicate meaningfully with parents, carers, and subsequent teachers

The guidance notes that assessment should not be burdensome or detract from the substantive learning of religious education. Rather, it should enhance pupils' engagement with religious and worldviews material by making learning objectives explicit and helping pupils recognise their own development.

### The Role of SACREs and Agreed Syllabuses

Each local authority (with the exception of the City of London and the Isles of Scilly) has a SACRE responsible for determining the locally agreed syllabus for RE. These syllabuses must be reviewed every five years and provide the legal basis for RE in community schools and voluntary controlled schools. Voluntary aided schools with a religious character may follow their own denominational syllabus, though many also draw upon locally agreed syllabuses for teaching about other religions and worldviews.

The agreed syllabus is the primary reference point for assessment in primary RE. Most contemporary syllabuses published since 2014 include explicit guidance on assessment, often providing:

- End-of-key-stage expectations or outcomes
- Progression frameworks showing development across year groups
- Exemplification materials illustrating standards
- Guidance on formative assessment strategies
- Models for summative assessment and reporting

The quality and specificity of assessment guidance varies considerably between local authorities. Some syllabuses, such as the Lancashire Agreed Syllabus (widely adopted beyond Lancashire itself), provide detailed progression frameworks and assessment exemplars. Others offer more general guidance, leaving schools to develop their own approaches. This variation creates a context where primary subject leaders must engage carefully with their specific agreed syllabus to understand the assessment expectations that apply to their context.

### Understanding Christianity and Church School Assessment

For Church of England schools, the Understanding Christianity resource has become a significant influence on assessment practice. This national project, developed by RE Today in collaboration with the National Society, provides not only substantive content for teaching Christianity but also an embedded assessment framework.

Understanding Christianity offers two complementary approaches to assessment:

1. **Knowledge Building Blocks**: These support a mastery model of assessment, identifying core knowledge that pupils should acquire and retain at each phase. The building blocks provide specific, assessable statements of what pupils should know and understand about Christianity.

2. **End-of-Phase/Key Stage Outcomes**: These integrate knowledge with the skills to handle, integrate, and apply understanding. The outcomes describe what pupils should be able to do by the end of each phase (typically Years 2, 5, and 8), combining substantive knowledge with disciplinary and personal knowledge.

The Understanding Christianity framework has influenced assessment practice beyond Church schools, with many community schools adopting or adapting its approaches. The resource's alignment with the SIAMS (Statutory Inspection of Anglican and Methodist Schools) framework has strengthened its uptake in Church schools, where assessment in RE is a focus for denominational inspection.

## Assessment Without Levels: The Post-2014 Context

### The Removal of National Curriculum Levels

The 2014 National Curriculum marked a significant shift in assessment policy across all subjects. National Curriculum levels, which had provided a common framework for describing pupil attainment since 1988, were removed. The DfE explained this decision by arguing that levels had become too abstract and broad, often obscuring the specific knowledge and skills that pupils had or had not acquired. The new primary curriculum was designed around the principle of "fewer things in greater depth," with assessment focused on whether pupils had secured the necessary knowledge and understanding.

For RE, the removal of levels created both opportunities and challenges. While RE had never had statutory levels in the same way as National Curriculum subjects, many local authorities and schools had developed or adopted level descriptors for RE. These provided a common language for describing progress and were widely used for reporting to parents and tracking overall attainment. Their absence required schools to develop new approaches to assessment.

### Approaches to Assessment Without Levels in RE

The post-2014 landscape has seen the emergence of several distinct approaches to assessment in primary RE:

#### 1. Mastery-Based Models

Drawing on the broader mastery movement in primary education, some schools and agreed syllabuses have adopted mastery-based assessment in RE. These approaches identify specific knowledge and understanding that pupils should achieve and assess whether they have secured this learning before progressing. The Understanding Christianity building blocks exemplify this approach, providing discrete statements of knowledge that can be assessed formatively.

Mastery-based assessment in RE typically involves:

- Clear identification of core knowledge for each unit or enquiry
- Regular formative assessment during teaching to identify gaps
- Opportunities for pupils to revisit and consolidate learning
- Summative judgements about whether pupils have achieved expected standards

Proponents argue that this approach ensures depth of understanding and prevents pupils from progressing with misconceptions. Critics note that RE involves significant personal and interpretive dimensions that may not fit neatly into a mastery framework, and that an overemphasis on discrete knowledge statements may obscure the holistic nature of religious understanding.

#### 2. Outcomes-Based Assessment

Many agreed syllabuses specify end-of-key-stage outcomes or expectations that describe what pupils should know, understand, and be able to do. These outcomes typically integrate substantive knowledge (knowledge about religions and worldviews), disciplinary knowledge (knowledge of how to study religion), and personal knowledge (pupils' own reflections and responses).

The Somerset Awareness, Mystery and Value syllabus exemplifies this approach, providing outcomes for each key stage that describe expected attainment. Teachers assess pupils against these outcomes, making professional judgements based on evidence from pupils' work and contributions. This approach preserves the holistic nature of RE while providing clear reference points for assessment.

#### 3. Progression in Disciplinary Skills

Some assessment frameworks focus primarily on the development of disciplinary skills in RE—the skills of investigating, interpreting, reflecting, and responding to religious and worldviews material. These approaches recognise that substantive knowledge varies considerably across different religions and topics, while the skills of engaging with religion and worldviews develop more predictably across Key Stages 1 and 2.

The NATRE skills progression documents provide a framework for this approach, outlining how skills develop from Year 1 to Year 6. Teachers assess pupils' competence in these skills, alongside their acquisition of substantive knowledge about specific religions and worldviews.

#### 4. Comparative and Benchmarking Approaches

In the absence of national standards, some schools and local authorities have developed approaches that assess pupils' attainment relative to expectations or benchmarks. These may involve:

- Standardised tasks or activities administered across schools
- Moderation exercises where teachers compare judgements
- Reference to nationally available exemplification materials
- Use of published assessment schemes or packages

Such approaches seek to provide consistency and comparability in the absence of levels, though they require significant investment in professional development and moderation processes.

## Progression Frameworks from Agreed Syllabuses

### The Structure of Agreed Syllabus Assessment Frameworks

Contemporary agreed syllabuses typically provide progression frameworks that describe expected development in RE across Key Stages 1 and 2. While the specific terminology and structure varies, most frameworks address three dimensions of progression:

#### Substantive Knowledge

Progression in substantive knowledge describes the expanding scope and depth of pupils' knowledge about religions and worldviews. This includes:

- **Breadth of content**: The range of religions and worldviews studied, typically expanding from a focus on Christianity and one other religion in Key Stage 1 to include multiple traditions in Key Stage 2
- **Depth of understanding**: The complexity of concepts and ideas that pupils engage with, moving from concrete, practice-focused content in Key Stage 1 to more abstract theological and philosophical concepts in Key Stage 2
- **Retrieval and retention**: The ability to recall and use prior learning in new contexts

Most agreed syllabuses specify the religions to be studied at each key stage and identify key concepts, practices, and beliefs that should be covered. Assessment frameworks track pupils' developing knowledge against these specifications.

#### Disciplinary Knowledge

Progression in disciplinary knowledge describes pupils' developing understanding of how religion and worldviews are studied. This includes:

- **Investigation skills**: The ability to ask questions, find information, and evaluate sources
- **Interpretation skills**: The ability to make sense of religious texts, practices, and beliefs
- **Analysis skills**: The ability to identify patterns, compare across traditions, and recognise diversity within religions
- **Evaluation skills**: The ability to weigh different perspectives and justify conclusions

The Ofsted Research Review for RE (2021) emphasised the importance of disciplinary knowledge in the subject, noting that effective RE teaches pupils not only what people believe and do but also how knowledge about religion is constructed and contested.

#### Personal Knowledge

Progression in personal knowledge describes pupils' developing capacity to reflect on their own experiences, beliefs, and values in light of their learning about religion and worldviews. This dimension of RE is particularly distinctive, as the subject explicitly makes space for pupils' own responses to the material studied.

Assessment of personal knowledge must be handled carefully to respect pupils' autonomy and avoid inappropriate scrutiny of their personal beliefs. Most frameworks assess pupils' ability to articulate their own reflections, engage respectfully with others' perspectives, and recognise how their own views have developed through learning—rather than assessing the content of their personal beliefs.

### Exemplar Progression Frameworks

#### Lancashire Agreed Syllabus

The Lancashire Agreed Syllabus (and the identical syllabuses used in Wigan, Warrington, Halton, and St Helens) provides a detailed progression framework organised around the three elements of the syllabus:

1. **Believing**: Religious beliefs, teachings, sources, questions about meaning, purpose, and truth
2. **Expressing**: Religious and spiritual forms of expression, questions about identity and diversity
3. **Living**: Religious practices and ways of living, questions about values and commitments

For each element, the syllabus specifies end-of-key-stage expectations at Key Stage 1, Lower Key Stage 2, and Upper Key Stage 2. These expectations describe what pupils should know, understand, and be able to do, providing clear reference points for assessment.

The Lancashire framework also provides "ladders" showing how expectations build across key stages, helping teachers to identify where pupils are in their learning and what they need to achieve next.

#### Cheshire West and Chester SACRE

The Cheshire West SACRE's RE Skills Progression document, developed by Naomi Anstice and shared via NATRE, provides a detailed framework for tracking development in disciplinary skills. The document identifies ongoing skills and attitudes that should be reflected throughout RE learning, organised into categories such as:

- Enquiry and investigation
- Interpretation and analysis
- Reflection and response
- Communication and expression

For each skill area, the progression document describes what developing competence looks like at different stages, from Year 1 through Year 6.

#### Telford and Wrekin SACRE

The Telford and Wrekin Agreed Syllabus (2021) emphasises progression in substantive knowledge, with explicit focus on evidencing progression through the accumulation and application of core knowledge. The syllabus identifies key concepts that thread through pupils' RE curriculum, providing coherence and supporting assessment of how knowledge builds over time.

### Tracking Progress Across Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2

Effective progression frameworks enable teachers to track pupils' development across the primary phase, identifying where pupils are secure in their learning and where gaps or misconceptions exist. Most frameworks support this through:

- **Baseline assessment**: Establishing what pupils know and can do at the start of a key stage or unit
- **Ongoing formative assessment**: Regular opportunities to check understanding and provide feedback
- **Periodic summative assessment**: Structured assessments at key points (typically end of year or end of key stage) to judge overall attainment
- **Transition information**: Communication of assessment information to receiving teachers at key transition points

The most effective practice involves teachers in regular moderation exercises, where they compare their assessments with colleagues to develop shared understanding of standards. This is particularly important in RE, where the absence of national assessment creates greater reliance on professional judgement.

## Practical Approaches to Assessment in Primary RE

### Formative Assessment Strategies

Formative assessment—assessment that informs teaching and learning as it happens—is central to effective RE. Practitioners use a range of strategies to check understanding and guide pupils' learning:

#### Questioning

Effective questioning in RE goes beyond recall to probe understanding, challenge assumptions, and extend thinking. Open questions that invite explanation, comparison, and evaluation are particularly valuable. The "3Cs" approach (comprehension, connection, and critical thinking) provides a framework for questioning that moves from basic understanding to deeper analysis.

#### Dialogue and Discussion

RE is fundamentally a dialogic subject, and classroom discussion provides rich opportunities for formative assessment. Skilled teachers use discussion to:

- Surface pupils' current understanding and misconceptions
- Model the disciplinary skills of interpreting and analysing religious material
- Support pupils in articulating and developing their thinking
- Identify where pupils need additional support or challenge

Strategies such as think-pair-share, concept cartoons, and structured debates provide structured opportunities for dialogue that reveal pupils' thinking.

#### Written Work and Artefacts

Pupils' written work and the artefacts they create in RE provide evidence of learning that can be assessed. However, the limitations of written expression, particularly for younger pupils, mean that assessment must be sensitive to the mode of expression and consider whether the work accurately represents pupils' understanding.

Many teachers use a range of response modes in RE—drawing, drama, discussion, writing, digital media—to give pupils multiple ways of demonstrating their learning. Assessment criteria should be applied flexibly across these different modes, focusing on the substantive, disciplinary, or personal knowledge demonstrated rather than the quality of the medium.

#### Retrieval Practice

The Ofsted Research Review for RE emphasised the importance of pupils knowing and remembering key knowledge about religion and worldviews. Retrieval practice—deliberately recalling previously learned material—supports retention and provides assessment information about what pupils have retained.

Low-stakes quizzing, "do now" activities at the start of lessons, and regular opportunities to revisit prior learning all support retrieval and reveal what pupils have actually retained from earlier teaching.

### Summative Assessment Approaches

Summative assessment in primary RE typically focuses on making judgements about pupils' attainment at key points, most commonly at the end of a unit of work, the end of a year, or the end of a key stage.

#### Unit Assessments

Many schools use end-of-unit assessments to judge pupils' learning within a specific enquiry or topic. These may take various forms:

- Extended written responses to a key question
- Application of learning to a new context or case study
- Structured tasks that assess specific knowledge or skills
- Pupils' own reflections on what they have learned

Unit assessments should align with the learning objectives of the unit and the expectations of the agreed syllabus. They provide information about whether pupils have achieved the intended learning and inform decisions about whether to move on or address gaps.

#### End-of-Year Judgements

Some schools make summative judgements about pupils' overall attainment in RE at the end of each year. These judgements typically draw on evidence from across the year, including unit assessments, ongoing work, and observations of pupils' contributions.

Common frameworks for these judgements include:

- **Working below/Working at/Working above age-related expectations**: A three-point scale aligned with the expectations of the agreed syllabus
- **Emerging/Developing/Secure**: Descriptions of the depth of pupils' attainment
- **Numbered scales or percentages**: Some schools have developed their own numerical systems

The key consideration is that these judgements have meaning—teachers can explain what a pupil knows and can do that leads to the judgement, and the judgement accurately reflects pupils' attainment against the agreed syllabus expectations.

#### End-of-Key-Stage Assessment

At the end of Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2, schools typically make more formal assessments of pupils' attainment in RE. These may feed into:

- Reports to parents and carers
- Information for receiving schools or teachers
- School-level data about RE attainment
- Self-evaluation and school improvement processes

Some agreed syllabuses provide end-of-key-stage assessment materials or tasks that can be used for this purpose. Others leave the approach to school discretion, providing only the expectations against which attainment should be judged.

### Assessment Without Levels: Practical Implementation

The transition to assessment without levels has required primary schools to develop new approaches in RE. Effective implementation typically involves several key elements:

#### Clear Reference Points

Schools need clear reference points against which to assess attainment. These may be:

- The end-of-key-stage expectations in the locally agreed syllabus
- The outcomes specified in Understanding Christianity (for Church schools)
- School-developed expectations based on agreed syllabus requirements
- Subject-specific criteria developed through professional collaboration

Whichever reference points are used, they should be shared with all staff who teach RE and with parents and carers, so that everyone understands what is being assessed and why.

#### Professional Development and Moderation

Assessment without levels places greater demands on teachers' professional judgement. Effective schools invest in professional development that supports teachers to:

- Understand the agreed syllabus expectations
- Recognise what secure learning looks like in RE
- Apply assessment criteria consistently
- Use assessment information to plan and adapt teaching

Moderation—comparing assessments with colleagues to develop shared understanding—is particularly important. Schools may moderate internally within their staff team, or participate in cross-school moderation through local authority networks, SACRE support, or diocesan programmes (for Church schools).

#### Recording and Tracking Systems

Schools need efficient systems for recording assessment information and tracking pupils' progress over time. These systems should:

- Capture meaningful information without creating excessive workload
- Enable teachers to identify pupils who need additional support or challenge
- Support reporting to parents and carers
- Provide school-level information for subject leadership and self-evaluation

Many schools have adapted their tracking systems from other subjects, using adapted language to reflect RE-specific expectations. Others have developed bespoke systems or adopted commercial tracking packages that include RE.

### Common Challenges and Solutions

#### Challenge 1: Varied Teacher Confidence

RE is often taught by non-specialists in primary schools, leading to variation in teachers' confidence in assessing the subject.

**Solutions:** Clear exemplification materials that illustrate standards; regular moderation opportunities; professional development focused on the agreed syllabus and assessment criteria; subject leadership that provides ongoing support and guidance.

#### Challenge 2: The Personal Dimension

RE's inclusion of personal reflection and response creates challenges for assessment, as teachers must assess the quality of pupils' engagement without inappropriately scrutinising their personal beliefs.

**Solutions:** Focus assessment on pupils' ability to articulate their reflections, engage respectfully with others, and recognise their own development—rather than the content of their beliefs; clear criteria that distinguish between substantive knowledge, disciplinary skills, and personal response; sensitivity in reporting that respects pupils' autonomy.

#### Challenge 3: Managing Workload

Assessment without levels can generate workload, particularly where schools have developed complex tracking systems or require frequent formal assessments.

**Solutions:** Focus on formative assessment that informs teaching without generating excessive recording; streamline summative assessment to key points; use sampling approaches where appropriate; ensure that assessment serves teaching and learning rather than existing for its own sake.

#### Challenge 4: Comparison Across Schools

The local determination of RE and the absence of national assessment makes it difficult to compare attainment across schools, which can be a concern for multi-academy trusts and for inspection.

**Solutions:** Participate in cross-school moderation to develop shared understanding; use agreed syllabus materials that provide common reference points; focus on the quality of pupils' work and the progress they make rather than seeking spurious comparability; recognise that some variation between contexts is legitimate given the nature of RE.

## Ofsted and Inspection Considerations

### The 2021 Research Review

Ofsted's Research Review for Religious Education (May 2021) provided significant guidance on assessment in the subject. The review emphasised that effective assessment in RE:

- Focuses on the content that has been taught, rather than generic skills
- Checks whether pupils have learned the curriculum—that is, whether they know and remember the intended content
- Provides information that teachers use to adapt their teaching
- Avoids creating unnecessary workload

The review highlighted the importance of assessment in securing the high-quality RE that is the goal of the curriculum. It noted that without effective assessment, teachers cannot know whether pupils have learned what was intended, and gaps in learning may persist and accumulate.

### Deep Dives

Under the Education Inspection Framework (EIF), inspectors conduct "deep dives" into selected subjects. When RE is chosen for a deep dive (which is common in Church schools and may happen in other schools with particular curricular strengths or concerns), inspectors will examine:

- Whether the RE curriculum is well-sequenced and ambitious
- Whether assessment checks whether pupils have learned the intended content
- Whether assessment information is used to inform teaching
- The quality of pupils' work and the progress they have made

Schools should be prepared to explain their approach to assessment, show how it aligns with the agreed syllabus, and demonstrate how it informs teaching and learning.

### SIAMS Inspection

For Church of England schools, SIAMS (Statutory Inspection of Anglican and Methodist Schools) inspection includes specific consideration of assessment in RE. The SIAMS schedule asks inspectors to evaluate how effectively the school assesses pupils' progress in religious education and uses this information to improve teaching and learning.

The Understanding Christianity assessment framework is well-aligned with SIAMS expectations, and schools using this resource typically find that they can demonstrate effective assessment practice. The key is to show that assessment is meaningful, manageable, and focused on improving pupils' learning.

## Key Principles for Effective Assessment

Drawing together the statutory framework, the guidance from agreed syllabuses, and the requirements of inspection, effective assessment in primary RE can be characterised by several key principles:

### 1. Alignment with the Agreed Syllabus

Assessment should be aligned with the locally agreed syllabus, which is the legal basis for RE in the school. The expectations, progression framework, and guidance in the agreed syllabus provide the reference points for assessment.

### 2. Focus on Knowledge

Assessment should focus on whether pupils have acquired the intended knowledge—substantive knowledge about religions and worldviews, disciplinary knowledge of how to study religion, and personal knowledge of their own responses and reflections. This includes both the recall of key content and the ability to use that knowledge in new contexts.

### 3. Integration with Teaching

Assessment should be integrated with teaching and learning, providing information that teachers use to plan, adapt, and improve their teaching. It should not be a separate activity that happens after teaching but a continuous process that informs it.

### 4. Manageability

Assessment should be manageable for teachers, avoiding excessive workload or bureaucracy. The focus should be on gathering useful information efficiently, not on creating elaborate tracking systems or recording every piece of evidence.

### 5. Meaningful Communication

Assessment should enable meaningful communication with pupils, parents, and subsequent teachers. This means providing information that goes beyond abstract labels ("emerging," "secure") to explain what pupils know and can do, and what they need to develop next.

### 6. Professional Judgement

Assessment in RE relies on teachers' professional judgement, supported by clear criteria, exemplification, and moderation. Schools should invest in developing teachers' assessment literacy and provide opportunities for collaborative assessment and moderation.

### 7. Respect for Pupils

Assessment should respect pupils as individuals, particularly in relation to the personal dimension of RE. It should not seek to evaluate the content of pupils' beliefs or impose particular perspectives, but rather assess their engagement with the subject and their development as reflective learners.

## Conclusion

Assessment in primary RE operates within a distinctive context of local determination and the absence of national assessment requirements. Since 2014 and the removal of National Curriculum levels, schools and local authorities have developed a range of approaches to assessment, drawing on progression frameworks from agreed syllabuses, resources such as Understanding Christianity, and the broader principles of assessment without levels.

Effective assessment in RE is aligned with the agreed syllabus, focused on pupils' knowledge and understanding, integrated with teaching and learning, and manageable for teachers. It relies on professional judgement supported by clear criteria and moderation, and it respects pupils as individuals while providing meaningful information about their learning.

The landscape continues to evolve, with ongoing development of agreed syllabuses, resources, and professional understanding. Primary subject leaders should engage actively with their agreed syllabus and SACRE, participate in professional networks, and continuously refine their approach to ensure that assessment serves the ultimate goal: high-quality religious education that enables pupils to understand religion and worldviews, develop their own responses, and engage respectfully with the diversity of belief and practice in contemporary society.
