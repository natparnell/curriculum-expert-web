# Formative Assessment in Religious Education

## Introduction: Why Formative Assessment Matters in RE

Formative assessment, or Assessment for Learning (AfL), represents the most important day-to-day assessment activity in Religious Education. Unlike summative assessment, which seeks to capture pupil attainment at a particular moment, formative assessment is embedded within teaching and learning processes, providing ongoing feedback that enables both teachers and pupils to adjust their approaches in real time. In RE specifically, formative assessment serves a crucial role because the subject deals with complex, contested, and deeply personal material—beliefs, values, practices, and ultimate questions that cannot be adequately captured through simple factual recall.

The Ofsted subject report "Deep and Meaningful?" (2024) found that very few schools could explain how they used assessment effectively in RE. In most sampled primary schools, the curriculum was not being used as the progression model. This finding underscores the urgent need for RE teachers to develop robust, principled approaches to formative assessment that genuinely illuminate pupil understanding rather than simply recording surface-level engagement.

Formative assessment in RE must address the distinctive nature of the subject. Religious Education involves both substantive knowledge—what pupils learn about religions and worldviews—and disciplinary knowledge—how pupils learn to think, question, and analyse within the subject. Effective formative assessment must attend to both dimensions, checking not only whether pupils can recall religious content but also whether they can deploy appropriate disciplinary tools to analyse and evaluate that content.

## The Principles of Formative Assessment in RE

### The Distinction Between Formative and Summative Assessment

Understanding the distinction between formative and summative assessment is essential for RE teachers. Summative assessment, or assessment of learning, seeks to make judgements about pupil attainment at a particular point in time. It typically involves formal assessments, examinations, or end-of-unit tests that generate grades or levels. Summative assessment has its place in RE, particularly at Key Stage 4 where pupils take GCSE qualifications, but it should not dominate assessment practice.

Formative assessment, by contrast, is assessment for learning. It occurs continuously during teaching and is designed to inform next steps for both teachers and pupils. The Welsh Government guidance on developing thinking and assessment for learning (2010) emphasises that formative assessment should be woven into everyday classroom practice rather than treated as a separate activity. In RE, this means using questioning, discussion, observation, and pupil self-assessment as integral components of lessons rather than add-on assessment events.

Buckinghamshire's RE syllabus guidance makes this distinction practical: "High-quality assessment in RE uses assessment sufficiently, but not excessively. Most assessment should be formative (assessment for learning) and there should be no more than 5 formal summative assessments (assessment of learning) across each of Key Stages 2 and 3, and fewer in Key Stage 1." This ratio reflects the principle that in RE, as in other subjects, the primary purpose of assessment should be to support learning rather than to measure it.

### Assessment as a Tool for Understanding Pupils' Thinking

The most important purpose of formative assessment in RE is to reveal what pupils actually think and understand, not merely what they can reproduce. Religious Education deals with matters of profound personal significance—questions of meaning, purpose, morality, and identity. Pupils bring to RE their own experiences, assumptions, and sometimes misconceptions about religion and worldviews. Effective formative assessment must surface these preconceptions so that teaching can address them directly.

Ofsted's "Realising the Potential" report (2013) warned that an overemphasis on certain types of assessment in RE frequently leads pupils to a superficial and often distorted understanding of religion. When teachers focus too heavily on measurable outcomes or rigid assessment criteria, they risk reducing RE to a subject about factual recall rather than genuine understanding. Formative assessment provides a counterbalance to this tendency by prioritising insight into pupil thinking over the generation of assessment data.

The London Diocesan Board for Schools (2023) emphasises that planned assessment opportunities should be identified at the beginning of a unit of learning, with ongoing formative assessment integrated throughout. This proactive approach ensures that assessment is not an afterthought but a planned component of curriculum design. Teachers should ask themselves: What would indicate that pupils are developing deeper understanding of this concept? What misconceptions might emerge? How will I know if pupils can apply disciplinary thinking to this material?

## Key Strategies for Formative Assessment in RE

### Effective Questioning Techniques

Questioning remains the most powerful and immediate formative assessment tool available to RE teachers. The quality of questioning determines the quality of information teachers receive about pupil understanding. In RE, effective questioning must move beyond simple recall to probe the depth and quality of pupils' engagement with religious concepts.

Bloom's taxonomy provides a useful framework for RE questioning. Lower-order questions check recall and comprehension: "What do Buddhists believe about the cause of suffering?" "What happens during a Christian baptism?" These questions have their place, particularly when establishing foundational knowledge. However, RE's distinctive contribution lies in higher-order questioning that asks pupils to analyse, evaluate, and create. "Why might the concept of nirvana be difficult to understand for someone raised in a Western culture?" "How convincing do you find the cosmological argument for God's existence?" "What questions would a philosopher ask about this religious practice?"

Open questions are particularly valuable in RE because they allow pupils to demonstrate the full range of their thinking. Closed questions that demand a single correct answer may be appropriate for checking substantive knowledge, but they cannot assess whether pupils can engage with the contested and interpretive dimensions of religion. Teachers should cultivate the habit of asking "What do you think?" and "Why do you think that?" as follow-ups to any pupil response, regardless of whether the initial answer is correct.

Wait time is a crucial but often neglected aspect of questioning. Research consistently shows that extending the pause after asking a question—typically to three seconds or more—results in longer, more thoughtful responses from pupils. In RE, where questions often deal with complex and sensitive matters, adequate wait time is essential. Teachers who rush to fill silence or move quickly to another pupil may never discover what pupils are actually capable of thinking.

### Observation and Listening Strategies

While questioning provides targeted assessment information, observation and listening offer continuous, unobtrusive insight into pupil learning. In RE lessons, which often involve discussion, group work, and creative activities, teachers can gather rich assessment data simply by attending carefully to what pupils say and do.

Partner and group talk provides invaluable opportunities for assessment. When pupils discuss religious questions with their peers, they often reveal understandings, misunderstandings, and developing thinking that they might not articulate in whole-class settings. The teacher's role is to circulate, listen, and intervene strategically. This requires careful planning: tasks must be structured so that genuine discussion is necessary, and teachers must resist the temptation to dominate conversations.

The "dot round" technique offers a focused approach to observation. As pupils engage in group discussion, the teacher moves from group to group, spending a few minutes listening to each. A simple recording sheet with pupils' names allows the teacher to note significant contributions, misconceptions, or questions that arise. Over the course of a lesson, this technique can provide assessment information about every pupil without disrupting the flow of learning.

In practical and creative RE activities—such as handling religious artefacts, creating artwork inspired by religious themes, or role-playing religious ceremonies—observation becomes particularly important. Pupils demonstrate understanding through their actions and interactions with materials in ways that written assessment might not capture. Teachers should develop expertise in reading these demonstrations of understanding, recognising that learning in RE is not always verbal or written.

### Using Pupil Self-Assessment and Peer Assessment

Developing pupils' capacity to assess their own learning and that of their peers represents a sophisticated application of formative assessment principles. When pupils engage in self-assessment, they develop metacognitive awareness—the ability to think about their own thinking. In RE, where personal reflection is central to the subject, self-assessment feels particularly natural and appropriate.

Self-assessment in RE can take many forms. Pupils might use simple rating scales to indicate their confidence with particular concepts: "I can explain the Five Pillars of Islam," "I can compare Christian and Hindu beliefs about God," "I can evaluate arguments for and against religious faith." More sophisticated approaches involve pupils identifying their own questions, setting learning targets, or reflecting on their developing understanding in learning journals.

The traffic light system (red/amber/green) offers a simple but effective self-assessment tool. Pupils indicate their confidence level with particular learning objectives, enabling the teacher to identify who needs additional support and who might benefit from extension activities. In RE, this system can be adapted to capture not just confidence with substantive content but also willingness to engage with challenging questions: "I feel comfortable discussing different religious beliefs," "I can respectfully disagree with others' viewpoints."

Peer assessment, when properly structured, can also support learning in RE. Pupils evaluating each other's work against clear criteria develop their own understanding of what quality looks like in the subject. However, peer assessment in RE requires careful handling because of the sensitive nature of the subject matter. Teachers must establish clear ground rules about respectful feedback and ensure that peer assessment focuses on the quality of reasoning and expression rather than the substance of beliefs expressed.

## Assessing Substantive Knowledge in RE

### Assessing Knowledge of Beliefs and Practices

Substantive knowledge in RE encompasses what pupils learn about religions and worldviews—their beliefs, practices, stories, texts, and lived expressions. Formative assessment of substantive knowledge must go beyond simple recall to check whether pupils have developed meaningful, organised, and retrievable understanding.

The Big Ideas framework, developed by Barbara Wintersgill and the RE Council, provides a powerful tool for assessing substantive knowledge. Rather than treating RE content as an undifferentiated mass of information, the Big Ideas identify the key concepts that organise and give meaning to substantive knowledge. These include ideas such as: religious beliefs are diverse and changing; religions involve different ways of life; religions offer answers to ultimate questions; religious identity is complex and multifaceted.

Assessing substantive knowledge through the lens of Big Ideas enables teachers to check not just whether pupils can recall isolated facts but whether they understand how these facts connect to larger patterns of meaning. When assessing pupil understanding of Christian beliefs about God, for example, the teacher might ask not only "What do Christians believe about God?" but also "How does the Christian understanding of God compare to the Hindu understanding?" or "Why might someone find the Christian concept of the Trinity difficult to understand?"

Concept mapping offers a useful formative assessment tool for checking the organisation of substantive knowledge. Pupils create visual representations showing how different concepts, beliefs, and practices connect to each other. A well-constructed concept map reveals not just what pupils know but how they understand the relationships between different elements of knowledge. Misconceptions often become visible through concept mapping in ways that might not emerge in verbal or written responses.

### Checking Understanding of Sacred Texts

Sacred texts represent a distinctive category of substantive knowledge in RE, requiring specific assessment approaches. Understanding a sacred text involves not merely knowing what it says but grasping how it functions within religious communities—how it is interpreted, how it shapes belief and practice, and how different communities understand its authority.

Formative assessment of sacred text understanding might involve asking pupils to:
- Retell a narrative from the text in their own words, checking comprehension of basic content
- Identify key teachings or principles that the text communicates
- Explain how believers interpret the text, including awareness of different interpretive approaches
- Analyse how the text is used in worship or religious practice
- Evaluate the text's significance for believers and its influence on their lives

Ofsted's 2024 RE subject report highlighted a strong example of formative assessment in primary RE: teachers introduced key vocabulary before a lesson, then recapped it during a story, and pupils subsequently used the correct vocabulary to explain the story's meaning. This approach demonstrates how assessment of sacred text understanding can be integrated seamlessly into teaching.

The concept of "scriptural reasoning" offers a sophisticated approach to assessing engagement with sacred texts. Developed through the Society for Scriptural Reasoning, this practice involves reading and discussing sacred texts across religious boundaries. In classroom contexts, teachers can assess pupils' capacity to engage respectfully and thoughtfully with texts from multiple traditions, noting their ability to identify significant passages, ask productive questions, and make connections between texts.

## Assessing Disciplinary Knowledge in RE

### Understanding the Three Disciplines of RE

Religious Education has increasingly been conceptualised as involving three distinct disciplines: theology, philosophy, and the human/social sciences. Each discipline brings different questions, methods, and forms of knowledge to the study of religion and worldviews. Formative assessment in RE must attend to pupils' developing capacity to work within these disciplinary modes.

Theology asks questions from within religious traditions, exploring how believers understand and articulate their faith. Theological thinking involves engaging with religious concepts on their own terms, understanding how believers make sense of their beliefs, and exploring the internal coherence of religious worldviews. When assessing theological understanding, teachers check whether pupils can explain religious beliefs from an insider perspective, use appropriate religious vocabulary, and recognise the diversity of belief within traditions.

Philosophy approaches religion through reason and argument, asking questions about the truth, coherence, and implications of religious claims. Philosophical thinking in RE involves analysing arguments for and against religious positions, identifying assumptions and logical implications, and evaluating the strength of different viewpoints. Formative assessment of philosophical understanding checks whether pupils can reconstruct arguments, identify premises and conclusions, and offer reasoned evaluations.

The human and social sciences (including anthropology, sociology, and psychology) study religion as a human phenomenon. This disciplinary approach asks questions about how religions function in societies, how religious identity is formed and maintained, and how religious practices relate to wider social patterns. Assessment of social scientific understanding checks whether pupils can describe and explain religious phenomena in social and cultural context, recognising the influence of factors such as history, geography, and social structure on religious expression.

### Assessing Pupils' Use of Disciplinary Tools

Formative assessment of disciplinary knowledge requires observing pupils actually using disciplinary tools in authentic contexts. Teachers cannot assess whether pupils can "do" philosophy simply by asking them to define philosophical thinking; they must provide opportunities for pupils to engage in philosophical reasoning and then assess the quality of that engagement.

Sentence starters offer a scaffolded approach to assessing disciplinary thinking. In philosophy lessons, pupils might complete sentences such as:
- "One argument for God's existence is..."
- "A problem with this argument is..."
- "A believer might respond by saying..."

These starters make the structure of philosophical reasoning visible and enable teachers to assess whether pupils are deploying the appropriate disciplinary moves.

In the social sciences, pupils might use investigative frameworks to structure their enquiry. When studying how a religious community practises its faith, for example, pupils might work with questions such as: Who participates? What happens? Where and when does it occur? Why do believers attach importance to this practice? How does it relate to other aspects of their lives? Pupils' use of such frameworks reveals their grasp of social scientific approaches to studying religion.

The disciplinary enquiry approach, advocated by the RE Council and others, structures units of work around disciplinary questions. A unit might be framed as a theological enquiry ("How do Christians understand the relationship between faith and works?"), a philosophical enquiry ("Can belief in miracles be rational?"), or a social scientific enquiry ("How does religious identity shape community life in contemporary Britain?"). Formative assessment within such units focuses on pupils' developing capacity to pursue the enquiry using appropriate disciplinary methods.

## Common Challenges in RE Assessment

### Assessing Personal Response and Reflection

One of the most challenging aspects of RE assessment concerns pupils' personal responses to the material studied. RE aims not only to develop knowledge and understanding but also to support pupils in developing their own informed perspectives on questions of meaning, value, and identity. Formative assessment must find ways to engage with this dimension of learning without becoming intrusive or evaluative of pupils' personal beliefs.

The distinction between assessing understanding and assessing belief is crucial here. Teachers can and should assess whether pupils understand different religious and non-religious positions on ultimate questions. They can assess whether pupils can explain why people hold these positions, engage with arguments for and against them, and articulate their own reasoned responses. What they cannot and should not assess is whether pupils' personal beliefs are correct or desirable.

Learning journals and reflective writing offer one approach to assessing personal response. Pupils record their developing thinking about questions raised in RE, noting how their understanding has changed and how they are grappling with challenging ideas. Teachers assess these journals not for the conclusions pupils reach but for the quality of reflection demonstrated—whether pupils engage seriously with different perspectives, recognise complexity, and support their views with reasons.

Ground rules for discussion are essential when assessment touches on personal response. Pupils need to know that they will not be judged for their beliefs, that respectful disagreement is encouraged, and that changing their minds in light of new learning is a sign of intellectual maturity rather than weakness. When these conditions are established, formative assessment can genuinely engage with pupils' personal responses; without them, assessment risks shutting down honest expression.

### Addressing Misconceptions in RE

RE is particularly susceptible to pupil misconceptions because the subject deals with material that is often unfamiliar, emotionally charged, and subject to stereotyping in wider culture. Formative assessment plays a crucial role in identifying and addressing these misconceptions before they become entrenched.

Common misconceptions in RE include:
- Treating religions as monolithic and unchanging rather than diverse and dynamic
- Confusing religious beliefs with cultural practices or ethnic identities
- Assuming that sacred texts are read literally by all believers
- Reducing complex theological concepts to simplistic formulas
- Viewing religious traditions in isolation rather than recognising their interconnections

Formative assessment strategies that surface these misconceptions include:
- "Show me" activities where pupils represent their current understanding visually
- Prediction exercises before encountering new material
- Agree/disagree activities that reveal assumptions
- Open-ended questions that invite pupils to articulate their thinking

When misconceptions are identified, teachers must decide whether to address them immediately or to build teaching around them. Sometimes direct correction is appropriate; at other times, carefully structured enquiry that enables pupils to discover the inadequacy of their misconception for themselves proves more effective. The decision depends on the nature of the misconception, the classroom context, and the teacher's knowledge of the pupils involved.

## Developing a Formative Assessment Culture in RE

### Building Assessment into Curriculum Planning

Effective formative assessment in RE does not happen by accident; it must be built into curriculum planning from the outset. Teachers and curriculum leaders should ask assessment questions at the point of unit design: What would indicate that pupils are making progress in this unit? What are the likely misconceptions? What opportunities will there be for pupils to demonstrate and develop understanding?

The Big Ideas framework supports this planning approach. By identifying the key concepts that structure a unit, teachers can plan assessment opportunities that check understanding of these concepts at different points. They can design activities that require pupils to apply concepts in new contexts
