# A Level Religious Studies Specifications: AQA, Edexcel and OCR Comparison

## Overview

A Level Religious Studies (RS) is a rigorous academic qualification that engages students with profound philosophical, ethical and theological questions. Since the 2016 reforms, all A Level specifications in England follow a linear structure, with students sitting all examinations at the end of the two-year course. The three main awarding bodies—AQA, Edexcel (Pearson) and OCR—offer broadly similar programmes combining philosophy of religion, ethics and the study of a particular religious tradition, yet each presents distinct content emphases, question styles and assessment approaches.

The study of RS at A Level develops critical thinking, analytical writing and the ability to construct sustained arguments—skills highly valued by universities and employers. All specifications require students to demonstrate both knowledge and understanding (AO1) and analysis and evaluation (AO2), though the weighting and expression of these assessment objectives varies subtly between boards.

## AQA A Level Religious Studies (7062)

### Structure and Assessment

AQA's A Level Religious Studies is structured around two equally weighted components, each assessed through a three-hour written examination worth 100 marks and representing 50% of the final grade.

**Component 1: Philosophy of Religion and Ethics**

This component combines philosophical and ethical study in a single examination. Section A addresses Philosophy of Religion, whilst Section B covers Ethics and Religion.

**Section A: Philosophy of Religion (50 marks)**

The philosophy content encompasses:

- Arguments for the existence of God, including ontological, cosmological and teleological arguments
- Evil and suffering as challenges to religious belief
- Religious experience and its philosophical evaluation
- Religious language, including verificationism, falsification and analogy
- Miracles, their definitions and philosophical assessment
- The self and life after death, exploring dualist, materialist and Buddhist perspectives

**Section B: Ethics and Religion (50 marks)**

The ethics content includes:

- Ethical theories: normative theories including natural moral law, situation ethics, Kantian ethics, utilitarianism and virtue ethics
- Issues of human life and death: abortion, euthanasia and the sanctity of life
- Issues of animal life and death: animal experimentation, use of animals for food and the moral status of animals
- Meta-ethics: the meaning and status of ethical language, including cognitivism and non-cognitivism
- Free will and moral responsibility: determinism, libertarianism and compatibilism
- Conscience: its nature, authority and psychological explanations
- Ethical comparisons between Bentham and Kant

**Component 2: Study of Religion and Dialogues**

This component requires students to study one religion in depth from a choice of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam or Judaism. The examination has three sections:

**Section A: Study of Religion (50 marks)**

For each faith option, students explore:

- Sources of wisdom and authority, including scripture, tradition and key religious figures
- God/gods/ultimate reality as understood within the tradition
- The self, death and the afterlife
- Good conduct and key moral principles
- Expression of religious identity through practice, ceremony and lifestyle
- Religion, gender and sexuality
- Religion and science
- Religion and secularisation
- Religion and religious pluralism

**Section B: The Dialogue between Philosophy of Religion and Religion (25 marks)**

Students engage with synoptic questions exploring how religion influences and is influenced by philosophy of religion in relation to the issues studied.

**Section C: The Dialogue between Ethical Studies and Religion (25 marks)**

Students address synoptic questions examining the relationship between religion and ethical studies.

### Assessment Characteristics

AQA papers employ two-part questions throughout, with part (a) typically testing AO1 (knowledge and understanding) for 10 marks and part (b) testing AO2 (analysis and evaluation) for 15 marks. Questions may span multiple topics, requiring students to make connections across the specification. The synoptic questions in Component 2 demand integration of knowledge from Component 1 with the study of religion.

## Edexcel A Level Religious Studies (9RS0)

### Structure and Assessment

Edexcel's A Level Religious Studies comprises four components, with three examined papers contributing to the final grade. The structure distributes assessment across Philosophy of Religion, Religion and Ethics, and New Testament Studies or a alternative religion option.

**Paper 1: Philosophy of Religion (9RS0/01)**

This two-hour examination carries 100 marks and represents 33.3% of the A Level.

Content areas include:

- Philosophical issues and questions, including the nature and existence of God
- The problem of evil and suffering, including the logical and evidential problems
- Religious experience and its philosophical evaluation
- Religious language, including verification, falsification and symbol
- Miracles, their definition and credibility
- Self, death and the afterlife, exploring dualism, materialism and resurrection

**Paper 2: Religion and Ethics (9RS0/02)**

This two-hour examination carries 100 marks and represents 33.3% of the A Level.

Content areas include:

- Ethical thought, including normative theories: natural law, situation ethics, virtue ethics, Kantian ethics and utilitarianism
- Application of ethical theories to contemporary issues including euthanasia and business ethics
- Meta-ethical theories: ethical naturalism, intuitionism, emotivism and prescriptivism
- Free will and moral responsibility: hard determinism, soft determinism and libertarianism
- Conscience and its authority
- Environmental ethics and equality

**Paper 3: New Testament Studies (9RS0/03)**

This two-hour examination carries 100 marks and represents 33.3% of the A Level. Note that centres may alternatively select Paper 4 (a study of a religion).

New Testament Studies content includes:

- Social, historical and religious context of the New Testament
- The text and contexts of Matthew's Gospel
- Interpreting the text and issues of relationship with Judaism
- The text and contexts of the Fourth Gospel (John)
- Scientific and historical-critical challenges and Christian responses

**Alternative Paper 3: Study of a Religion**

Centres may choose to study Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism or Sikhism. The structure follows four areas of study:

- Religious beliefs, values and teachings
- Sources of wisdom and authority
- Practices that shape and express religious identity
- Social and historical developments in religious thought

### Assessment Characteristics

Edexcel papers employ a mixture of short-answer questions, extended writing and essay questions. Section A typically contains multiple-part questions testing specific knowledge, whilst Section B requires extended evaluative responses. The New Testament Studies option emphasises textual analysis and historical-critical methods, distinguishing it from AQA's and OCR's systematic theology approaches.

## OCR A Level Religious Studies (H573)

### Structure and Assessment

OCR's A Level Religious Studies is structured around three components of equal weighting, each assessed through a two-hour examination worth 120 marks and representing 33.3% of the final grade.

**Component 01: Philosophy of Religion (H573/01)**

Content areas include:

- Ancient philosophical influences: Plato and Aristotle on reality, knowledge and the soul
- The nature of the soul, mind and body: dualism, materialism and alternative views
- Arguments about the existence or non-existence of God: ontological, cosmological, teleological and challenge from evolution
- The nature and impact of religious experience: visions, numinous experiences and mystical experiences
- The challenge for religious belief of the problem of evil: the logical and evidential problems, theodicies and free will defences
- Ideas about the nature of God: timelessness vs. everlastingness, omnipotence, omniscience and their coherence
- Issues in religious language: verification and falsification, analogy, symbol, myth and language games

**Component 02: Religion and Ethics (H573/02)**

Content areas include:

- Normative ethical theories: natural law, Kantian ethics, utilitarianism (including Bentham and Mill), situation ethics and virtue ethics
- The application of ethical theory to two contemporary issues: typically business ethics and euthanasia, or environmental ethics and animal experimentation
- Ethical language and thought: cognitivism and non-cognitivism, intuitionism, emotivism and prescriptivism
- Debates surrounding the significant idea of conscience: its authority, psychological explanations (Freud) and theological perspectives
- Sexual ethics and the influence on ethical thought of developments in religious beliefs: pre- and extra-marital sex, homosexuality and contraception

**Component 03-07: Developments in Religious Thought**

Students select one religion from:

- Christianity (03)
- Islam (04)
- Judaism (05)
- Buddhism (06)
- Hinduism (07)

For each religion, students explore:

- Religious beliefs, values and teachings, their interconnections and how they vary historically and in the contemporary world
- Sources of religious wisdom and authority, including scripture, tradition and reason
- Practices which shape and express religious identity, and how these vary within a tradition
- Significant social and historical developments in theology and religious thought
- Key themes related to the relationship between religion and society: gender, sexuality, science, secularisation and pluralism

### Assessment Characteristics

OCR examinations employ a range of question types including short-answer questions, medium-length responses and extended essays. The "developments in religious thought" title signals OCR's emphasis on historical and theological development within religious traditions, rather than merely systematic description. Students encounter questions requiring evaluation of developments and changes within religious thought over time.

### Philosophical Content Comparison

| Topic | AQA | Edexcel | OCR |
|-------|-----|---------|-----|
| Ancient philosophy | Not specified | Limited mention | Plato and Aristotle explicitly required |
| Arguments for God's existence | All major arguments | All major arguments | All major arguments plus evolution challenge |
| Problem of evil | Covered | Logical and evidential distinction | Emphasis on logical/evidential distinction |
| Religious experience | Covered | Covered | Explicit categories: visions, numinous, mystical |
| Religious language | Verification, falsification, analogy | Verification, falsification, symbol | Plus myth, language games, Wittgenstein |
| Nature of God | Included in various topics | Included in various topics | Explicit treatment of omnipotence/omniscience coherence |

### Ethical Content Comparison

| Topic | AQA | Edexcel | OCR |
|-------|-----|---------|-----|
| Normative theories | All major theories | All major theories | All major theories |
| Meta-ethics | Cognitivism/non-cognitivism | Naturalism, intuitionism, emotivism, prescriptivism | Cognitivism and non-cognitivism explicitly |
| Applied ethics | Human and animal life/death | Euthanasia, business ethics | Two issues selected from broader list |
| Conscience | Psychological and theological | Authority of conscience | Freud explicitly mentioned |
| Free will | Determinism, libertarianism, compatibilism | Hard/soft determinism, libertarianism | Less explicit coverage |
| Sexual ethics | Included under religion dialogues | Equality focus | Explicit sexual ethics section |

### Religious Study Options

All three boards offer Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism and Buddhism. AQA additionally offers Sikhism (implied in later updates), whilst Edexcel explicitly lists Sikhism as an option for Paper 4. OCR's "Developments in Religious Thought" title reflects its distinctive emphasis on historical and theological development within traditions.

### Question Styles and Assessment

**AQA** employs consistent two-part questions: 10-mark AO1 followed by 15-mark AO2. This predictable structure allows students to develop template approaches, though synoptic questions in Component 2 demand genuine integration of knowledge.

**Edexcel** mixes question types more extensively, with some shorter knowledge questions alongside extended essays. The New Testament Studies option requires skills in textual analysis distinct from philosophical argumentation.

**OCR** offers the most varied question types, including short definitions, medium explanations and extended evaluations. The explicit inclusion of ancient philosophy in Component 01 distinguishes OCR's philosophical preparation.

### Synoptic Requirements

AQA explicitly requires synoptic engagement through the dialogue sections in Component 2, where students must integrate philosophical and ethical knowledge with religious studies. OCR's "Developments" approach implicitly requires synoptic thinking about historical change within religions. Edexcel's New Testament option creates synoptic demands through the combination of textual, historical and theological analysis.

## Pedagogical Implications

### Choosing a Specification

**Consider AQA when:**

- Seeking predictable question structures that facilitate consistent essay practice
- Wanting explicit synoptic assessment that rewards cross-component connections
- Preferring a philosophy-ethics integration in Component 1
- Requiring the most extensive teacher resource and textbook availability

**Consider Edexcel when:**

- Interested in New Testament Studies as a distinctive theological option
- Preferring a three-paper structure that separates philosophy, ethics and religion
- Seeking business ethics and environmental ethics as applied topics
- Wanting a specification that explicitly includes Sikhism

**Consider OCR when:**

- Valuing ancient philosophy as explicit foundation for religious studies
- Seeking the most comprehensive treatment of religious language
- Wanting explicit historical development within religious traditions
- Preferring varied question types that test knowledge at different levels

### Teaching Approaches

Regardless of specification, effective A Level RS teaching requires:

**Philosophy Component:** Building from foundational concepts (arguments for God's existence) through to complex evaluative issues (religious language). OCR's explicit ancient philosophy requirement makes Platonic and Aristotelian foundations more accessible.

**Ethics Component:** Connecting normative theories to applied issues. All specifications require students to apply theories to practical dilemmas, though the specific applications vary. Regular practice with moral reasoning develops evaluative capacity.

**Religion Component:** Moving beyond descriptive knowledge to analytical understanding of how religious traditions develop, respond to challenges and engage with contemporary issues. OCR's "Developments" title signals this explicitly; other specifications require similar depth.

### Common Challenges

Students across all specifications commonly struggle with:

- Distinguishing descriptive knowledge (AO1) from evaluative analysis (AO2)
- Sustaining argumentation over extended essays (typically 25-30 marks)
- Managing synoptic connections between philosophy, ethics and religious study
- Understanding meta-ethical theories, particularly the distinction between cognitivism and non-cognitivism

### Assessment Preparation

**For AQA:** Focus on two-part question technique, ensuring AO1 precision and AO2 development. Practice synoptic connections between Component 1 and Component 2 throughout the course rather than treating them as separate units.

**For Edexcel:** Develop skills across question types, particularly the shorter knowledge questions that require precise definitions. For New Testament Studies, build textual familiarity alongside theological interpretation.

**For OCR:** Prepare for varied question demands, ensuring students can write both concise definitions and extended evaluations. The ancient philosophy requirement demands secure understanding of Platonic and Aristotelian foundations.

## Progression and Higher Education

A Level Religious Studies provides excellent preparation for degrees in Philosophy, Theology, Religious Studies, Politics, Law and related humanities subjects. All three specifications develop transferable skills of analysis, evaluation and extended writing. University admissions tutors typically value RS for its combination of conceptual rigour and engagement with fundamental human questions.

The philosophical content of all three specifications provides foundation for undergraduate philosophy, particularly epistemology, philosophy of religion and ethics. The religious study components prepare students for theology and religious studies degrees, whilst the analytical skills developed support any humanities or social science discipline.

---

## Resources and Support

Each awarding body provides extensive teacher support:

**AQA:** Comprehensive textbooks from multiple publishers, extensive past paper banks, standardisation materials and regular teacher network meetings.

**Edexcel:** Published resources including the New Testament Studies anthology, online teaching materials and examiner reports with detailed commentary.

**OCR:** Detailed specification guidance, sample assessment materials, teacher guides and subject advisor support for both Philosophy and Religious Studies.

Third-party resources including textbooks, revision guides and online materials vary in availability, with AQA generally enjoying the widest range of published support due to its larger entry numbers.

---

## Conclusion

The three A Level Religious Studies specifications offer genuine choice whilst maintaining comparable academic rigour. AQA's predictable structure and extensive resources make it accessible for many centres. Edexcel's New Testament option provides distinctive theological content attractive to some schools. OCR's ancient philosophy requirement and "Developments" approach offer explicit foundations for historical and conceptual understanding.

The "best" specification depends on departmental expertise, student interests and resource availability rather than intrinsic differences in difficulty or value. All three develop the analytical, evaluative and extended writing skills that make A Level Religious Studies a respected preparation for higher education and beyond.

Teachers should select specifications based on their capacity to deliver the content with enthusiasm and expertise, recognising that passionate, knowledgeable teaching matters more than the particular awarding body chosen.
