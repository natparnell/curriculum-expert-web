# Philosophy of Religion

## Overview

Philosophy of religion is the branch of philosophy that examines the fundamental nature of religious belief and practice. It addresses questions that have occupied human thought for millennia: Does God exist? Why is there evil in the world? Can miracles occur? How can we speak meaningfully about the divine? What is the relationship between faith and reason?

Within Religious Education (RE) in England, philosophy of religion forms a core component of both GCSE and A Level specifications. The AQA GCSE Religious Studies specification includes Theme C: "The Existence of God and Revelation," whilst A Level Philosophy of Religion extends study to include ancient philosophical influences, the nature of the soul, and sophisticated debates about religious language. This knowledge file provides comprehensive coverage of the major topics, arguments, and pedagogical approaches for teaching philosophy of religion in secondary schools.

## Arguments for the Existence of God

### The Design Argument (Teleological Argument)

The design argument, also known as the teleological argument (from the Greek *telos*, meaning purpose), contends that the universe exhibits order, complexity, and purpose that point to the existence of an intelligent designer—God.

#### Classical Formulations

**William Paley's Watchmaker Analogy (1802)** remains the most influential popular formulation. Paley invites us to imagine finding a watch upon a heath: the intricate mechanism, with its precisely fitted parts working together to tell time, would immediately suggest a watchmaker. Paley argues that the universe is "even more complicated than a watch" and therefore "must have been designed by an extremely clever being, not by accident." The only possible designer, Paley concludes, is God.

**Thomas Aquinas's Fifth Way** presents the argument differently. Aquinas observes that inanimate objects in the natural world act towards ends—arrows fly towards targets, plants grow towards light—yet lack intelligence. Since "whatever lacks intelligence cannot move towards an end unless it is directed by some being endowed with knowledge and intelligence," there must be an intelligent being who directs all natural things to their end. This being, Aquinas argues, we call God.

#### Strengths and Weaknesses

The design argument's strengths include its intuitive appeal—it aligns with human experience of purposeful creation—and its basis in observable evidence. The fine-tuning of physical constants necessary for life, the complexity of biological organisms, and the intelligibility of the universe all appear to support design.

Weaknesses include David Hume's critique that we cannot legitimately extrapolate from human design to cosmic design, and that apparent design might result from natural processes. Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection provided a naturalistic explanation for biological complexity that challenged Paley's biological examples. Additionally, the argument from design seems to lead to a limited designer—why assume a perfect, infinite God rather than merely a very powerful, very intelligent one?

### The First Cause Argument (Cosmological Argument)

The cosmological argument seeks to demonstrate God's existence from the existence of the universe itself, reasoning from observed contingency or causation to a necessary first cause.

#### Classical Formulations

**Thomas Aquinas's Second Way** argues from efficient causation. In the observable world, causes precede effects; nothing causes itself. If there were no first cause, there would be no subsequent effects. Yet there clearly are effects. Therefore, there must be a first cause, which Aquinas identifies as God.

**Aquinas's Third Way** argues from contingency. In the universe, things come into being and pass away—they are contingent. If everything were contingent, there would have been a time when nothing existed. But if nothing existed, nothing could begin to exist. Since things do exist, there must be something that is not contingent—something that exists necessarily. This necessary being is God.

**The Kalām Cosmological Argument**, developed by medieval Islamic philosophers and revived by William Lane Craig, adds the premise that an actually infinite regress of causes is impossible. Therefore, the universe must have a temporal beginning, which requires a cause beyond itself.

#### Strengths and Weaknesses

The cosmological argument begins from apparently undeniable premises: things exist, and their existence requires explanation. It fits with the principle of sufficient reason, which holds that everything must have a reason or cause.

Critics, including Hume and Kant, question whether we can apply causation beyond the phenomenal world of experience. Bertrand Russell argued that the universe might simply be a "brute fact" requiring no explanation. Others suggest that if God is exempt from the requirement for a cause, why not the universe itself?

### The Ontological Argument

The ontological argument differs from design and cosmological arguments by proceeding from the concept of God to God's existence, attempting to show that God's existence is logically necessary.

#### Anselm's Formulation (1078)

Anselm of Canterbury defined God as "that than which nothing greater can be conceived" (*id quo maius cogitari non potest*). Even the fool who denies God's existence, Anselm argues, understands this definition. But something that exists in reality as well as in the understanding is greater than something existing only in the understanding. Therefore, if God existed only in the understanding, we could conceive of something greater—namely, God existing in reality. This would contradict the definition. Therefore, God must exist in reality.

#### Modern Developments

**René Descartes** offered a variation: existence is a perfection, and God possesses all perfections. Therefore, God necessarily exists.

**Norman Malcolm** and **Charles Hartshorne** developed modal versions of the argument using the distinction between necessary and contingent existence. If God is defined as a necessarily existing being, then God's non-existence would be impossible, for if God could fail to exist, existence would be contingent, not necessary.

#### Strengths and Weaknesses

The ontological argument, if successful, would prove God's existence with certainty, independent of empirical observation. It suggests that denying God's existence involves a logical contradiction.

However, Gaunilo of Marmoutiers immediately objected that similar reasoning would prove the existence of a perfect island—therefore, the argument proves too much. Immanuel Kant argued that existence is not a predicate or property that adds to perfection; "existence" functions differently from genuine predicates. Most contemporary philosophers regard the ontological argument as invalid, though it remains philosophically significant for clarifying concepts of God and existence.

## The Problem of Evil

### Statement of the Problem

The problem of evil poses the most significant intellectual challenge to theism. Epicurus (342–271 BCE) formulated the classic statement: "Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence evil?"

The logical problem of evil argues that the following propositions are jointly inconsistent:
1. God is omnipotent (all-powerful)
2. God is omnibenevolent (all-loving)
3. God is omniscient (all-knowing)
4. Evil exists

Since evil clearly exists, the argument concludes that God—defined as possessing all three attributes—does not exist.

### Types of Evil

Philosophers distinguish between:

**Natural Evil**: Suffering caused by natural processes—earthquakes, disease, predation, congenital disabilities. This poses a particular challenge because it cannot be easily attributed to human free will.

**Moral Evil**: Suffering caused by human actions—war, cruelty, oppression, murder. This can be linked to human free will, which provides the basis for some theodicies (justifications of God's goodness despite evil).

### Theodicies: Defences Against the Problem of Evil

**Augustinian Theodicy**: St. Augustine argued that evil is not a positive reality but *privatio boni*—the privation or absence of good. God created a good world; evil entered through the free will of angels and humans. The punishment of sin is just, and God's ultimate plan brings greater good from evil.

**Irenaean Theodicy**: Irenaeus and modern philosopher John Hick propose that evil serves a pedagogical purpose. Human beings are created imperfect and must develop through "soul-making" experiences. Suffering provides opportunities for moral and spiritual growth that would be impossible in a world without challenges.

**Free Will Defence**: Developed by Augustine and refined by Alvin Plantinga, this argues that free will is a supreme good worth the risk of evil. God could prevent evil only by preventing free will, but a world with free creatures is better than one with mere automata.

### Challenges for Theodicy

Critics question whether any theodicy adequately addresses:
- The quantity and intensity of suffering (the Holocaust, childhood cancer)
- Natural evil unrelated to free will
- The distribution of suffering (why do the innocent suffer while the guilty prosper?)
- Whether any goods justify extreme suffering

## Miracles

### Definitions of Miracles

**The Traditional Definition**: Aquinas distinguished three senses of miracle: (1) events God does that nature cannot do (creation), (2) events God does that nature can do but not in this order (resurrection), and (3) events God does that nature can do but without the usual natural means (healing).

**David Hume's Definition**: "A miracle is a violation of the laws of nature; and as a firm and unalterable experience has established these laws, the proof against a miracle, from the very nature of the fact, is as entire as any argument from experience can possibly be imagined."

**R.F. Holland's Definition**: Miracles need not violate natural laws. A miracle occurs when an event, though explicable naturally, takes on religious significance as a sign or revelation of divine presence.

### Arguments For and Against Miracles

**Arguments For**: Religious traditions report numerous miracles throughout history. The resurrection of Jesus is central to Christianity. Some argue that testimony, if sufficient, can establish that miracles have occurred. Others suggest that miracles provide evidence of divine existence and concern.

**Hume's Critique**: Hume argued that no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle unless the falsehood of the testimony would be more miraculous than the miracle itself. Since human testimony is often unreliable, and natural laws are established by uniform experience, rational people should reject miracle claims.

**Modern Developments**: C.S. Lewis defended miracles as interventions by a supernatural power. R.M. Burnyeat questioned whether miracles can be identified independently of prior religious commitment. Contemporary discussion often focuses on whether the concept of violating natural laws is coherent and what kind of evidence could support miracle claims.

### Miracles in Religious Education

The AQA GCSE specification requires study of "the argument from miracles, including its strengths and weaknesses, and one example of a miracle." Students should understand miracles both as potential evidence for God's existence and as objects of faith for religious believers.

## Religious Language

### The Problem of Religious Language

Religious statements appear to describe God, who is typically understood as infinite, eternal, and transcendent. Yet human language derives from finite, temporal, immanent experience. Can such language meaningfully describe God?

### Verificationism and Falsification

**Logical Positivism**: The Vienna Circle, particularly A.J. Ayer, argued that a statement is meaningful only if it is either analytically true (true by definition) or empirically verifiable. Religious statements like "God exists" or "God loves us" are neither analytic nor empirically verifiable; therefore, they are cognitively meaningless—mere expressions of emotion.

**The Verification Principle's Demise**: The verification principle faced difficulties: it could not verify itself, and it ruled out many scientific statements (universal laws, theoretical entities). Most philosophers abandoned strict verificationism.

**Falsification**: Antony Flew argued that religious claims are unfalsifiable—believers will not allow anything to count against their claims. For genuine assertions to be meaningful, there must be possible evidence against them. Since religious claims apparently deny this, they are not genuine assertions.

### Alternative Approaches

**The Via Negativa (Negative Way)**: Pseudo-Dionysius and subsequent mystics argued that we can only say what God is not—God is not finite, not limited, not changeable. Positive statements about God are analogical at best.

**Analogy**: Thomas Aquinas proposed that religious language works analogically. When we say "God is good," we do not mean exactly what we mean when we say "John is good," nor something completely different. There is a proportionality between God's goodness and human goodness.

**Symbol**: Paul Tillich argued that religious symbols participate in the reality they symbolise. The cross symbolises ultimate concern and reconciliation; it is not merely a sign pointing to something else but participates in the reality of God's acceptance.

**Wittgenstein and Language Games**: Ludwig Wittgenstein's later philosophy suggested that meaning is determined by use within a "language game" or "form of life." Religious language is meaningful within religious practice, even if it does not correspond to scientific language games.

## Faith and Reason

### The Relationship Between Faith and Reason

Philosophers and theologians have proposed various relationships between faith and reason:

**Rationalism**: Some, like Descartes, attempt to demonstrate religious truths through reason alone. If successful, faith would be unnecessary; reason would provide certainty.

**Fideism**: Søren Kierkegaard and others argue that faith transcends reason. Religious belief requires a "leap of faith" beyond what reason can justify. Evidence might even be an obstacle to genuine faith.

**Compatibilism**: Thomas Aquinas and many contemporary thinkers argue that faith and reason are compatible. Reason can demonstrate some religious truths (God's existence); others require revelation (the Trinity). Faith builds upon but extends beyond reason.

**Evidentialism**: W.K. Clifford argued that "it is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence." Religious belief without evidence is epistemically and morally irresponsible.

**Reformed Epistemology**: Alvin Plantinga argues that belief in God can be "properly basic"—not based on other beliefs or evidence but still rational, like belief in other minds or the external world.

### Pascal's Wager

Blaise Pascal offered a pragmatic argument: reason cannot determine whether God exists, so we must wager. If we believe and God exists, we gain infinite reward; if we believe and God does not exist, we lose little. If we disbelieve and God exists, we lose infinite reward. Therefore, it is rational to believe.

Critics object that belief cannot be chosen pragmatically, that the wager assumes a particular concept of God, and that it could justify belief in any potential deity.

## Pedagogical Approaches to Teaching Philosophy of Religion

### Building Foundational Knowledge

The Ofsted Research Review Series: Religious Education (2021) emphasises that "pupils may need prior knowledge of distinctive Christian concepts such as 'resurrection' and knowledge of the social and spiritual dimensions of concepts such as 'evil'." Effective teaching of philosophy of religion requires:

**Conceptual Clarity**: Ensure students understand technical terms—omnipotence, omniscience, omnibenevolence, necessary being, contingent being, theodicy—before engaging with arguments.

**Philosophical Method**: Teach students to identify premises, conclusions, and logical structure. Encourage them to evaluate whether premises are true and whether conclusions follow validly.

**Multiple Perspectives**: Present arguments alongside critiques. Avoid presenting any single position as obviously correct; instead, model intellectual humility and careful evaluation.

### Progression Across Key Stages

**Key Stage 3**: Foundation concepts can be introduced through engaging questions—"If God is all-powerful and all-loving, why do bad things happen?" Simple versions of arguments can be explored through stories and discussion.

**GCSE**: Systematic study of arguments, their strengths and weaknesses. Students should be able to explain arguments in their own words, evaluate them using philosophical criteria, and consider religious and non-religious responses.

**A Level**: Deeper engagement with primary texts, sophisticated critiques, and complex debates (religious language, verificationism, modal arguments). Students should develop independent philosophical reasoning.

### Teaching Strategies

**Socratic Questioning**: Use probing questions to develop thinking—"What do you mean by 'greater'?" "Must every event have a cause?" "Can something exist only in the understanding?"

**Structured Debate**: Assign students positions to defend, requiring them to engage seriously with views they may not hold. Debates on the problem of evil or the validity of miracle claims develop reasoning skills.

**Written Argumentation**: Require students to construct sustained arguments, with clear premises, evidence, and consideration of counter-arguments. Philosophy of religion provides excellent opportunities for developing extended writing.

**Integration with Religious Studies**: Philosophy of religion should not be taught in isolation. Connect arguments to religious traditions, texts, and practices. The design argument resonates with biblical creation accounts; the problem of evil connects to the Book of Job and the crucifixion.

### Common Misconceptions and Challenges

**Conflating Science and Philosophy**: Students may confuse scientific questions (how did the universe begin?) with philosophical ones (why is there something rather than nothing?). Clarify the distinction between empirical and metaphysical questions.

**Personal Conviction vs. Philosophical Argument**: Students may struggle to separate personal belief from philosophical evaluation. Encourage them to understand and evaluate arguments regardless of their own position.

**Over-Simplification**: Arguments are often complex. Avoid presenting caricatures; engage with sophisticated formulations and acknowledge ongoing philosophical debates.

**Emotional Responses**: The problem of evil touches genuine suffering. Approach with sensitivity, acknowledging that for many, this is not merely an intellectual puzzle but a lived reality.

## Conclusion

Philosophy of religion addresses questions of profound human significance. The arguments for God's existence, the challenge of evil, the possibility of miracles, the meaningfulness of religious language, and the relationship between faith and reason have occupied brilliant minds for centuries. No consensus has emerged; intelligent, informed people disagree profoundly.

For students of Religious Education, engagement with philosophy of religion develops critical thinking, careful analysis, and respectful engagement with diverse viewpoints. Whether students become convinced theists, atheists, or agnostics, philosophical study of religion cultivates intellectual virtues that serve them well beyond the classroom.
