# Non-Religious Worldviews in Religious Education

## Overview

The inclusion of non-religious worldviews in Religious Education (RE) represents one of the most significant developments in the subject's history. Following the landmark 2015 High Court ruling in *R (Fox and Others) v Secretary of State for Education* [2015] EWHC 3404 (Admin), and the subsequent Commission on Religious Education (CoRE) report in 2018, the place of humanism, secularism, atheism, and other non-religious perspectives has moved from marginalisation to centre stage in curriculum debates.

Ofsted's Research Review Series: Religious Education (2021) established that high-quality RE includes teaching about non-religious worldviews on an equal footing with religious traditions. However, the 2024 Ofsted subject report found that half of secondary schools visited made no reference to non-religious perspectives, highlighting the ongoing gap between policy aspiration and classroom practice.

## Defining Non-Religious Worldviews

### Humanism

Humanism represents the most prominent non-religious worldview in educational contexts. Humanists UK, the leading organisation representing humanists in Britain, defines humanism as:

- **Naturalistic**: Humanists believe that the universe is a natural phenomenon with no supernatural element
- **Rational**: Humanists use evidence and reason to understand the world
- **Ethical**: Humanists believe we can live good, meaningful, and worthwhile lives without religious belief
- **Human-centred**: Humanists emphasise human dignity, autonomy, and the pursuit of human flourishing

The philosopher Julian Baggini describes humanism as "the universe not made for us, but we for ourselves." This encapsulates the humanist emphasis on human agency in creating meaning and value.

Historical figures associated with humanist thought include:

- **Classical antiquity**: Socrates, Epicurus, and the Stoics
- **Renaissance**: Petrarch, Pico della Mirandola, and Erasmus
- **Enlightenment**: Voltaire, Hume, Kant, and Jefferson
- **Modern era**: Bertrand Russell, A. J. Ayer, Martha Nussbaum, and Philip Pullman

In educational contexts, humanism is particularly significant because it provides a coherent, systematic worldview that functions analogously to religious traditions while remaining non-supernatural. This makes it pedagogically valuable for comparative study.

### Secularism

Secularism, distinct from humanism, focuses primarily on the relationship between religion and state. The National Secular Society defines secularism as:

- **Separation**: Of religious institutions from state institutions
- **Equality**: No religious privilege or discrimination
- **Freedom**: Freedom of religion and freedom from religion

Secularism is not inherently anti-religious; rather, it seeks to ensure that religious and non-religious citizens are treated equally. As the philosopher Charles Taylor argues, secularism represents a political settlement that enables religious diversity to flourish.

Charles Clarke and Linda Woodhead's 2018 report for the Westminster Faith Debates distinguished between:

- **Secularism type 1**: Separation of church and state (French *laïcité* model)
- **Secularism type 2**: Equal treatment of all worldviews (UK model since the mid-20th century)

The UK model explicitly includes non-religious worldviews alongside religious ones, requiring state institutions (including schools) to give them "equal respect."

### Atheism and Agnosticism

**Atheism** is the absence of belief in deities. It ranges from:

- **Strong atheism**: Positive belief that no gods exist
- **Weak atheism**: Absence of belief without claiming knowledge
- **Philosophical atheism**: Systematic philosophical arguments against theism

**Agnosticism**, following T. H. Huxley who coined the term, is the position that the existence of the divine is unknown or unknowable. This is not a middle ground between belief and non-belief, but rather a position about what can be known.

In educational contexts, it is important to distinguish between:

- **Philosophical positions**: What people believe or don't believe
- **Lived experience**: How people actually live their lives
- **Identity categories**: How people label themselves

Research by the British Social Attitudes Survey indicates that while only a minority identify as "atheist" or "humanist," a majority of young people do not identify with any religion, making non-religious worldviews their default framework for meaning-making.

## Legal and Policy Framework

### The Fox Judgment (2015)

The 2015 High Court ruling in *R (Fox and Others) v Secretary of State for Education* fundamentally altered the legal landscape for RE. The case concerned the DfE's claim that an RS GCSE syllabus excluding non-religious worldviews would satisfy statutory RE requirements.

Mr Justice Warby ruled that the DfE had made "a false and misleading statement of law." The judgment clarified that:

- The statutory requirement for RE to be "broadly Christian" does not exclude non-religious worldviews
- The requirement to reflect the "principal religious traditions" in Great Britain must be read alongside the principle of equal respect for non-religious beliefs
- At Key Stage 4, RE must include systematic study of non-religious worldviews

The judgment did not require equal time or equal status, but rather that non-religious worldviews be treated with "equal respect" and not systematically excluded.

### The Commission on Religious Education (2018)

The Commission on Religious Education, established in 2016 with John Hall (then Dean of Westminster) as chair, published its final report, *Religion and Worldviews: The Way Forward*, in September 2018. Its key recommendations included:

**Renaming the Subject**

The Commission proposed renaming RE as "Religion and Worldviews" to make explicit its inclusion of non-religious perspectives. This reflects the fact that "everyone has a worldview," whether religious or not.

**National Entitlement**

The Commission proposed a National Entitlement setting out what every pupil should learn, regardless of their local agreed syllabus. This would include:

- Systematic study of worldviews (both religious and non-religious)
- Development of religious and worldview literacy
- Engagement with questions of meaning, purpose, and value
- Understanding of diversity within and between worldviews

**A Three-Disciplinary Approach**

The Commission recommended that Religion and Worldviews draw on three disciplinary lenses:

1. **Theology**: Exploring questions of meaning, truth, and value within traditions
2. **Philosophy**: Engaging with questions of knowledge, existence, and ethics
3. **Human/Social Sciences**: Understanding how worldviews function in human societies

This framework accommodates both religious and non-religious worldviews, applying appropriate disciplinary tools to each.

### The National Content Standard (2024)

Building on the CoRE recommendations, the Religious Education Council published the *National Content Standard for RE in England* in 2024. This non-statutory framework aims to provide consistent guidance across the patchwork of locally agreed syllabuses.

The Standard embeds non-religious worldviews throughout, recognising that:

- Worldviews include both religious and non-religious perspectives
- Non-religious worldviews have significant historical and contemporary importance
- Understanding diversity requires engagement with non-religious perspectives

## Ofsted Guidance

### Research Review Series: Religious Education (2021)

Ofsted's 2021 research review provided the first official inspection guidance addressing non-religious worldviews. It established that:

"High-quality RE includes teaching about non-religious worldviews on an equal footing with world religions."

The review identified three dimensions of progress in RE:

1. **Substantive knowledge**: Learning about worldviews (beliefs, practices, traditions)
2. **Disciplinary knowledge**: Learning how worldviews are studied (theology, philosophy, human/social sciences)
3. **Personal knowledge**: Reflecting on one's own worldview and those of others

The review noted that non-religious worldviews are often inadequately addressed, particularly in relation to their substantive content and internal diversity.

### Subject Report: Religious Education (2024)

The 2024 subject report confirmed ongoing implementation challenges:

- Half of secondary schools visited made no reference to non-religious perspectives
- Where humanism was included, it was often treated superficially
- Schools sometimes conflated non-religious worldviews with "no religion" or atheism alone
- The quality of resources for teaching non-religious worldviews varied significantly

The report emphasised that the inclusion of non-religious worldviews is not optional but a requirement for high-quality RE.

---

## Wales: The Religion, Values and Ethics (RVE) Reform

Wales provides a case study of comprehensive reform. The Curriculum and Assessment (Wales) Act 2021, which came into force in 2022, requires:

- Equal teaching of humanism alongside religions
- Humanist representatives on SACREs and Agreed Syllabus Conferences
- Renaming of the subject to "Religion, Values and Ethics"

The Welsh model demonstrates that systematic inclusion of non-religious worldviews is legislatively feasible and practically implementable. The Welsh Government worked closely with Humanists UK and the REC to develop guidance and resources.

The Welsh approach treats worldviews as "ways of making sense of the world and living within it," a definition that encompasses both religious and non-religious perspectives without privileging either.

---

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Comparative Study

Non-religious worldviews are most effectively taught through comparison with religious traditions. This approach:

- Highlights similarities in function (providing meaning, ethics, community)
- Reveals differences in content (natural vs. supernatural foundations)
- Develops religious and worldview literacy through explicit comparison
- Avoids treating any worldview as the default or norm

For example, comparing humanist ethics with Christian ethics:

- Both seek to promote human flourishing
- Both emphasise compassion and respect for persons
- They differ in their foundations (natural vs. divine command)
- They differ in their account of moral knowledge (reason vs. revelation)

### Phenomenological and Philosophical Approaches

The phenomenological approach, associated with Ninian Smart, can be applied to non-religious worldviews through his "dimensions of religion" framework:

- **Doctrinal**: Humanist manifestos, atheist arguments, secular principles
- **Mythic**: Humanist narratives of progress, scientific origin stories
- **Ethical**: Humanist ethics, secular moral philosophy
- **Ritual**: Humanist ceremonies (weddings, funerals, naming ceremonies)
- **Social**: Humanist communities, secular organisations
- **Experiential**: Awe at the natural world, existential reflection

The philosophical approach engages students with arguments for and against theism, examining:

- Cosmological arguments
- Teleological arguments
- Arguments from evil
- Arguments from religious experience
- Pragmatic arguments

### Handling Controversy

The inclusion of non-religious worldviews can be controversial in some school communities. Effective pedagogy includes:

- **Clear distinction**: Between education about worldviews and promotion of any worldview
- **Neutral framing**: Treating all worldviews with equal respect without endorsing any
- **Parental engagement**: Communicating the educational rationale clearly
- **Pupil voice**: Acknowledging that many pupils come from non-religious backgrounds

The National Association of Teachers of Religious Education (NATRE) provides guidance on handling objections, emphasising that the inclusion of non-religious worldviews is a legal and educational requirement, not a matter of teacher preference.

## Non-Religious Worldviews in Practice

### Key Stage 1 and 2

At primary level, non-religious worldviews can be introduced through:

- **Questions about the world**: Exploring scientific and non-scientific answers
- **Difference and diversity**: Recognising that people have different beliefs
- **Values and ethics**: Exploring where values come from without assuming a religious source
- **Ceremonies and community**: Comparing religious and humanist life events

The "Big Ideas" in primary RE can be addressed from multiple perspectives:

- **Being special**: What makes humans special? (religious vs. naturalistic answers)
- **Looking after our world**: Stewardship vs. responsibility without a deity
- **Special times**: Religious festivals vs. secular celebrations

### Key Stage 3

At Key Stage 3, students can engage more systematically:

- **Introduction to humanism**: Its history, key figures, and contemporary practice
- **Philosophy of religion**: Arguments for and against God's existence
- **Ethics**: Divine command theory vs. secular ethics (consequentialism, deontology, virtue ethics)
- **Science and religion**: Different worldviews' approaches to scientific questions

The CoRE three-disciplinary approach can be applied:

- **Theology**: What humanists believe about meaning, death, and the good life
- **Philosophy**: Humanist epistemology and ethics
- **Human/Social Sciences**: Demographics of non-religion, humanist communities

### GCSE

GCSE specifications vary in their treatment of non-religious worldviews:

- **AQA**: Includes humanism as a specified non-religious worldview alongside religions
- **Edexcel**: Offers optional study of non-religious worldviews
- **OCR**: Includes secular perspectives in some topics

The Fox judgment requires that regardless of specification, schools must ensure their RE curriculum includes systematic study of non-religious worldviews.

Effective GCSE teaching includes:

- **Diversity within non-religious worldviews**: Not all non-religious people are humanists
- **Contemporary issues**: Secular approaches to medical ethics, environmental ethics, peace and conflict
- **Textual engagement**: Humanist writings (Russell, Hitchens, Grayling, de Botton)

### A Level

At A Level, non-religious worldviews can be studied through:

- **Philosophy of religion**: Atheism and agnosticism as philosophical positions
- **Ethics**: Meta-ethical debates (naturalism vs. non-naturalism)
- **Developments in Christian thought**: Responses to secularisation
- **Study of religion**: The "believing without belonging" phenomenon

---

## Common Misconceptions

### Pupil Misconceptions

Research and classroom practice reveal several common misconceptions:

- **"Non-religious means anti-religious"**: Many pupils conflate non-religious worldviews with opposition to religion
- **"Atheists have no morals"**: The misconception that ethics requires religious foundation
- **"Humanism is just doing what you want"**: Confusing humanism with hedonism or individualism
- **"Science disproves religion"**: An oversimplified conflict narrative

Effective teaching addresses these explicitly through careful exposition and philosophical argument.

### Teacher Misconceptions

Teachers sometimes hold misconceptions that affect their teaching:

- **"Non-religious worldviews aren't substantial enough to study"**: Underestimating the richness of humanist philosophy
- **"Parents will object"**: Overestimating controversy; most parents support inclusive RE
- **"It's not really RE"**: Confusing RE with religious instruction or nurture
- **"Humanism is the only non-religious worldview"**: Neglecting secularism, atheism, agnosticism, and other perspectives

---

## Resources and Support

### Humanists UK

Humanists UK provides extensive free resources for teaching about humanism:

- **Understanding Humanism**: Website with videos, articles, and teaching materials
- **Speakers**: Humanist school speakers available for visits
- **Training**: CPD for teachers on teaching humanism
- **Free materials**: Posters, booklets, and lesson plans

The "Introduction to Humanism" resources are particularly valuable, providing age-appropriate materials for all key stages.

### Religious Education Council (REC)

The REC provides guidance on implementing the National Content Standard, including:

- The "Developing a Religion and Worldviews approach" toolkit (2024)
- Guidance on including non-religious worldviews in locally agreed syllabuses
- Resources for curriculum development

### NATRE

The National Association of Teachers of Religious Education provides:

- Professional development on teaching worldviews
- Resources and lesson plans
- Guidance on legal requirements
- Community support through local hubs

## Conclusion

The inclusion of non-religious worldviews in RE represents not a dilution of the subject but its maturation into "Religion and Worldviews." This development reflects:

- **Legal requirements**: The Fox judgment and subsequent guidance
- **Educational integrity**: Studying the worldviews actually held by the population
- **Pupil entitlement**: All pupils deserve to see their own worldviews reflected in curriculum
- **Social cohesion**: Understanding diversity requires understanding non-religious perspectives

As the UK becomes increasingly non-religious, the inclusion of humanism, secularism, atheism, and other non-religious worldviews in RE moves from optional extra to essential component. The Commission on Religious Education's vision of a National Entitlement that includes systematic, rigorous study of all major worldviews—religious and non-religious—points the way forward for the subject.

The challenge for teachers and curriculum leaders is to move from tokenistic inclusion to substantive engagement, treating non-religious worldviews with the same depth, respect, and rigour as religious traditions. This requires appropriate resources, professional development, and a clear understanding of the legal and educational rationale.

## Assessment and Progression

### Assessing Understanding of Non-Religious Worldviews

Effective assessment in RE requires careful consideration of how to assess understanding of non-religious worldviews without privileging either insider or outsider perspectives.

**Knowledge Assessment**

Questions should assess substantive knowledge of non-religious worldviews:

- "Explain two key beliefs held by humanists about the origin of the universe."
- "Describe how secularists view the relationship between religion and the state."
- "Outline the difference between strong and weak atheism."

Such questions parallel those asked about religious traditions, treating non-religious worldviews as equally substantive.

**Understanding and Analysis**

Higher-order questions develop analytical skills:

- "Evaluate the humanist argument that morality does not require God."
- "Compare and contrast Christian and humanist approaches to environmental ethics."
- "Assess the claim that secularism necessarily leads to religious decline."

These questions require pupils to engage critically with non-religious worldviews, not merely describe them.

**Evaluation and Synthesis**

The most demanding assessment requires pupils to synthesise and evaluate:

- "'Humanism is simply religion without God.' Discuss."
- "Evaluate whether a secular state best serves both religious and non-religious citizens."

Such questions require understanding of both religious and non-religious perspectives and the ability to adjudicate between them.

### Progression in Understanding

Progression in understanding non-religious worldviews can be mapped across key stages:

**Key Stage 1**

- Recognising that some people do not believe in God
- Identifying similarities between how religious and non-religious people might act
- Understanding that people celebrate life events in different ways

**Key Stage 2**

- Describing what humanists believe
- Explaining why some people are not religious
- Comparing religious and humanist ceremonies
- Understanding that ethics can exist without religion

**Key Stage 3**

- Explaining humanist arguments about meaning and purpose
- Outlining philosophical arguments for and against God's existence
- Comparing secular and religious approaches to moral questions
- Understanding the diversity within non-religious worldviews

**Key Stage 4**

- Evaluating humanist responses to philosophical and ethical questions
- Analysing the relationship between secularism and religious freedom
- Comparing and contrasting worldviews on ultimate questions
- Developing independent, reasoned positions on worldview questions

### Common Assessment Pitfalls

Teachers should avoid:

- **Asking pupils to adopt a non-religious perspective**: "Imagine you are a humanist..." may be experienced as requiring pupils to adopt a worldview they do not hold
- **Assessing commitment rather than understanding**: "Do you think humanism is right?" assesses opinion, not knowledge
- **Treating non-religious worldviews as default**: Assuming all pupils understand non-religious perspectives without teaching them
- **Neglecting non-religious worldviews entirely**: Failing to include them in assessment as well as teaching

## Case Studies: Implementing Non-Religious Worldviews

### Case Study 1: Primary School with Mixed Community

A primary school in a community with significant Muslim, Christian, and non-religious populations revised their RE curriculum to include humanism alongside religions. Approaches included:

- **Autumn term**: Studying Diwali (Hindu), Christmas (Christian), and humanist perspectives on light and hope
- **Spring term**: Exploring Easter (Christian), Ramadan (Muslim), and humanist perspectives on new beginnings
- **Summer term**: Life events—comparing religious naming ceremonies with humanist naming ceremonies

The school reported increased engagement from non-religious families and better understanding among religious pupils of their non-religious peers.

### Case Study 2: Secondary School with Single Faith Dominance

A secondary school in an area with predominantly Christian heritage found that pupils struggled to understand non-religious worldviews. The RE department implemented:

- **Year 7**: Introduction to worldviews—everyone has a worldview, religious or not
- **Year 8**: Philosophy of religion unit including atheist and agnostic perspectives
- **Year 9**: Ethics unit comparing religious and humanist approaches
- **GCSE**: Systematic study of humanism alongside Christianity

The department invited humanist speakers and used resources from Humanists UK. GCSE results improved, and pupil surveys indicated greater appreciation of diversity.

### Case Study 3: Academy with No Religious Character

An academy without religious character used the flexibility of its non-locally agreed syllabus status to develop a "Religion and Worldviews" curriculum aligned with CoRE recommendations:

- Equal time for religious and non-religious worldviews
- Three-disciplinary approach (theology, philosophy, human/social sciences)
- Systematic study of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and humanism at Key Stage 3
- Philosophy and ethics focus at Key Stage 4 including secular perspectives

The school became a hub for RE professional development in its region, sharing resources and practice with other schools.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Teacher Confidence

Many RE teachers were trained when non-religious worldviews were marginal to the subject and may lack confidence teaching about humanism or secularism.

**Solutions**:

- Professional development through NATRE, Humanists UK, and local SACREs
- Collaborative planning with colleagues
- Use of expert speakers and online resources
- Recognition that teachers are not expected to be "experts" but facilitators of learning

### Challenge 2: Resource Availability

While resources for teaching major religions are plentiful, materials for non-religious worldviews have been less developed.

**Solutions**:

- Humanists UK's free resources for all key stages
- NATRE's resource hub
- Development of locally agreed syllabus materials
- Critical use of philosophical ethics resources (which often take secular perspectives)

### Challenge 3: Parental Concern

Some parents may be concerned about the inclusion of non-religious worldviews, either viewing it as undermining religion or as promoting secularism.

**Solutions**:

- Clear communication that RE educates about worldviews without promoting any
- Engagement with parents through curriculum evenings and information sharing
- Reference to legal requirements and Ofsted guidance
- Emphasis on inclusion and respect for all worldviews

### Challenge 4: Time and Curriculum Pressure

With limited curriculum time, some schools struggle to do justice to both religious and non-religious worldviews.

**Solutions**:

- Integration rather than addition—teaching worldviews together rather than separately
- Cross-curricular links with philosophy, ethics, and citizenship
- Prioritisation based on local context and pupil needs
- Recognition that quality matters more than quantity—deep engagement with fewer worldviews is better than superficial coverage

## The Future of Non-Religious Worldviews in RE

### Potential Developments

Several developments may shape the future inclusion of non-religious worldviews:

**National Curriculum Status**

Campaigners continue to press for RE (or Religion and Worldviews) to be placed on the National Curriculum. This would provide consistent entitlement and reduce the current postcode lottery of provision. A National Curriculum would likely embed non-religious worldviews explicitly.

**Wales as a Model**

Wales's RVE reforms will be watched closely. If successful, they may provide a template for England. Early indications suggest positive engagement with the new approach, though challenges of implementation remain.

**Changing Demographics**

As the non-religious proportion of the population continues to grow (particularly among younger people), the case for inclusion becomes stronger. Schools serving predominantly non-religious communities find that excluding non-religious worldviews makes RE irrelevant to their pupils.

**Ofsted Expectations**

As Ofsted's focus on non-religious worldviews becomes established, schools will need to demonstrate inclusion to achieve good inspection outcomes. The 2024 subject report suggests this focus is intensifying.

### Ongoing Debates

**Worldviews vs. Traditions**

Some scholars and practitioners question whether "worldview" is the appropriate category, arguing that it may homogenise diverse phenomena or create a false equivalence between very different kinds of commitment.

**Equal Respect vs. Equal Time**

The legal requirement is for "equal respect," not necessarily equal time. Schools must decide how to balance coverage of religious and non-religious perspectives, taking into account their local context and the National Entitlement principles.

**Inclusion vs. Tokenism**

There is a risk that non-religious worldviews are included tokenistically—mentioned but not taught systematically. True inclusion requires the same depth of study as religious traditions.
