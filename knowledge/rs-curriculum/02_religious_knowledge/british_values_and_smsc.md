# RE and British Values: Democracy, Rule of Law, Individual Liberty, and Mutual Respect

## Introduction

Religious Education (RE) occupies a unique and vital position within the English school curriculum in relation to the promotion of fundamental British values. The Department for Education (DfE) has reinforced the expectation that all schools must "create and enforce a clear and rigorous expectation on all schools to promote the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs." RE is not merely one vehicle among many for delivering these values—it is arguably the subject best positioned to explore them in depth, given its statutory obligation to engage with diverse religious and non-religious worldviews.

This knowledge base examines the intersection of RE with British values, Spiritual, Moral, Social and Cultural (SMSC) development, and the Prevent duty. It provides educators with a comprehensive understanding of the legal framework, pedagogical approaches, and practical classroom strategies for realising these obligations whilst maintaining the integrity of RE as a rigorous academic subject.

## The Legal and Policy Framework

### Statutory Obligations

The requirement for schools to promote British values emerged from several interconnected pieces of legislation and guidance. Section 78 of the Education Act 2002 requires schools, as part of a broad and balanced curriculum, to promote "the spiritual, moral, cultural, mental and physical development of pupils at the school and of society." This longstanding duty predates the specific British values agenda but provides its statutory foundation.

The Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 placed the Prevent duty on a statutory footing. Section 26 of this Act requires specified authorities, including schools and further education providers, to "have due regard to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism." The Prevent duty guidance for England, published by the Home Office, specifies that schools should exemplify British values in their practice and challenge extremist narratives.

The Teachers' Standards, which apply to all maintained schools and academies, require teachers to uphold public trust in the profession and maintain high standards of ethics and behaviour. Part Two specifically expects teachers to demonstrate "fundamental British values, including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect, and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs."

### Ofsted Inspection Framework

Ofsted's School Inspection Handbook makes clear that inspectors will evaluate how effectively schools promote British values through SMSC development. Paragraph 237 of the handbook outlines that all schools must promote SMSC, and the inspection framework assesses the effectiveness of this provision. RE contributes significantly to all four SMSC domains:

**Spiritual development** in RE involves pupils developing their ability to be reflective about their own beliefs, religious or otherwise, that inform their perspective on life. It includes fostering interest in and respect for different people's faiths, feelings, and values. Pupils learn to develop a sense of enjoyment and fascination in learning about themselves, others, and the world around them.

**Moral development** through RE involves pupils learning to recognise the difference between right and wrong, readily applying this understanding in their own lives. RE provides rich opportunities to explore ethical frameworks from diverse traditions and to grapple with complex moral dilemmas.

**Social development** encompasses pupils using a range of social skills in different contexts, including working and socialising with pupils from different religious, ethnic, and socio-economic backgrounds. RE explicitly addresses interfaith understanding and community cohesion.

**Cultural development** involves pupils understanding and appreciating the wide range of cultural influences that have shaped their own heritage and that of others. RE is central to understanding religious heritage as a key component of cultural development.

## The Four Fundamental British Values in RE

### Democracy

Democracy in the context of British values refers to respect for democracy and support for participation in the democratic process. RE contributes to this value in several distinctive ways.

#### Conceptual Foundations

RE classrooms provide space for pupils to understand how different religious and philosophical traditions have engaged with questions of governance, authority, and collective decision-making. Many religious traditions contain resources for thinking about consultation, community deliberation, and the common good. Islamic concepts of shura (consultation), Quaker models of consensus decision-making, and Christian traditions of synodality all offer perspectives on collective discernment.

#### Classroom Pedagogy

Democratic practice in RE involves creating classrooms where pupils experience democratic processes. This includes:

- **Circle time and discussion**: Structured opportunities for all pupils to contribute to collective inquiry
- **Debates and deliberation**: Formal and informal opportunities to argue positions and listen to opposing views
- **Pupil voice**: Involving pupils in decisions about RE curriculum content and pedagogical approaches
- **Voting and consensus-building**: Using democratic methods to resolve questions within the classroom

#### Cross-Curricular Connections

RE teachers should make explicit connections with Citizenship education, particularly regarding the development of parliamentary democracy, the operation of democratic institutions, and the importance of active participation. However, RE's distinctive contribution lies in exploring the ethical and theological underpinnings of democratic commitments—why democracy might be valued from different worldview perspectives.

### The Rule of Law

The rule of law value emphasises respect for the basis on which the law is made and applies in England, including the responsibility of citizens to understand the distinction between civil law and religious law.

#### Religious and Civil Law

A significant area of RE curriculum content addresses the relationship between religious and civil law. Pupils learn about religious legal traditions—Sharia in Islam, Halakha in Judaism, Canon Law in Christianity—and how believers navigate their relationship with civil law in contemporary Britain.

The DfE guidance specifically notes that understanding the difference between the law of the land and religious law is an important component of SMSC. RE must handle this topic with nuance, avoiding both the implication that religious law supersedes civil law and the suggestion that religious legal traditions are inherently problematic.

#### Ethical Reasoning

RE contributes to the rule of law by developing pupils' capacity for ethical reasoning. Understanding why laws exist, the principles that underpin legal systems, and the relationship between law and morality are all enhanced by engagement with religious and philosophical ethics. Kantian deontology, utilitarianism, natural law theory, and virtue ethics all inform legal reasoning and are standard content in RE at Key Stage 4 and beyond.

#### Prevent Duty Alignment

The Prevent duty specifically requires schools to ensure pupils understand the rule of law as a fundamental British value. RE contributes to Prevent objectives by developing pupils' understanding of:

- The relationship between religious commitments and civic obligations
- The history of religious tolerance and its legal underpinnings in Britain
- How democratic societies balance religious freedom with other rights

### Individual Liberty

Individual liberty involves support and respect for the liberties of all within the law, including freedom of speech, freedom of religion or belief, and freedom from discrimination.

#### Freedom of Religion or Belief

Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. RE plays a crucial role in helping pupils understand what this freedom means in practice—the right to hold beliefs, to manifest those beliefs, and to change one's beliefs.

The RE classroom should model respect for freedom of religion or belief by:

- Including non-religious worldviews (humanism, secularism, atheism) on an equal footing with religious traditions
- Creating safe spaces for pupils to express their own beliefs and doubts
- Exploring case studies where freedom of religion conflicts with other rights
- Examining how different societies protect or restrict religious freedom

#### Personal Autonomy and Religious Tradition

RE addresses the tension between individual autonomy and religious tradition—a tension central to many adolescents' experience. Pupils explore how different traditions balance individual interpretation with communal authority, how religious identity is negotiated in plural societies, and how individuals make meaning within or outside religious frameworks.

#### Critical Thinking

Individual liberty in RE is supported by developing pupils' capacity for critical thinking. The Ofsted subject report "Deep and meaningful?" (2024) emphasises that high-quality RE involves pupils and teachers working with claims about religious and non-religious traditions whilst bringing their own reflections to the table. This critical engagement supports individual autonomy whilst maintaining respect for tradition.

### Mutual Respect and Tolerance

Mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs represents perhaps the most natural alignment between RE and British values. This value explicitly addresses support for equality of opportunity for all and respect for different faiths, beliefs, and worldviews.

#### Interfaith Understanding

RE provides systematic education about the beliefs, practices, and values of different religious traditions. This education is foundational to respect—respect based on understanding rather than mere tolerance. High-quality RE goes beyond superficial knowledge to engage with how believers actually live their faiths, including internal diversity within traditions.

#### Addressing Stereotypes and Prejudice

RE has a particular responsibility to challenge stereotypes and prejudice. This includes:

- Addressing Islamophobia through nuanced engagement with Muslim diversity
- Challenging antisemitism through education about Judaism in its own terms
- Combating Hinduphobia and other forms of religious prejudice
- Addressing prejudice against non-religious people

The Lancashire SACRE's "Challenging Religious and Worldwide Stereotypes" toolkit provides practical resources for this work.

#### Controversial Issues

RE classrooms regularly address controversial issues—gender and sexuality, abortion, euthanasia, war and peace, environmental ethics. Handling these controversies with respect for different viewpoints whilst maintaining educational integrity requires skilled pedagogy. The DfE guidance emphasises that schools should remain safe places for children to debate controversial issues and develop the critical thinking skills needed to challenge extremist arguments.

## SMSC Development Through RE

### Spiritual Development

Ofsted defines spiritual development as involving pupils developing their ability to be reflective about their own beliefs (religious or otherwise) and their interest in and respect for different people's faiths, feelings, and values. RE's contribution includes:

**Self-reflection**: RE lessons provide structured opportunities for pupils to consider their own responses to existential questions—meaning, purpose, mortality, suffering. This reflection is not merely intellectual but engages emotions and imagination.

**Encountering transcendence**: Through engaging with religious texts, art, music, and ritual, pupils encounter expressions of transcendence. Even for pupils who do not hold religious beliefs, understanding what transcendence means to others is spiritually educative.

**Awe and wonder**: RE can cultivate appreciation for the extraordinary—whether understood religiously as divine creation or naturalistically as the wonder of existence. This contributes to what the Ofsted framework calls "a sense of enjoyment and fascination in learning about themselves, others and the world around them."

### Moral Development

RE's contribution to moral development extends beyond learning what different religions teach about right and wrong. It includes:

**Ethical reasoning**: RE develops pupils' capacity to reason about moral issues, drawing on religious and philosophical frameworks. This includes understanding the difference between descriptive and normative claims—what people do believe versus what they ought to believe.

**Moral imagination**: Through case studies, stories, and role-play, RE develops moral imagination—the capacity to see situations from different perspectives and to understand how moral decisions affect others.

**Moral commitment**: RE provides opportunities for pupils to develop their own moral frameworks, informed but not determined by the traditions they study. This supports the development of ethical autonomy.

### Social Development

RE contributes to social development through:

**Community understanding**: Learning about religious communities helps pupils understand the social fabric of Britain, including how religious communities contribute to civil society.

**Interfaith dialogue**: RE introduces pupils to the principles and practices of interfaith dialogue—learning to engage constructively with people whose beliefs differ from one's own.

**Conflict resolution**: Religious traditions contain rich resources for peace-making and conflict resolution. RE can equip pupils with skills for managing disagreement constructively.

### Cultural Development

Cultural development through RE involves:

**Understanding religious heritage**: Britain's religious heritage—Christian, pre-Christian, and increasingly multi-faith—is central to understanding British culture. RE provides education about this heritage in ways that are both appreciative and critical.

**Global perspectives**: RE connects pupils to global religious communities, supporting cultural understanding that extends beyond Britain.

**Arts and culture**: RE engages with religious art, architecture, music, and literature, contributing to aesthetic and cultural education.

## The Prevent Duty and RE

### Understanding Prevent

Prevent is one of the four strands of CONTEST, the UK government's counter-terrorism strategy. The Prevent duty, established by the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015, requires schools to have due regard to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism.

Prevent defines extremism as "vocal or active opposition to fundamental British values, including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs." Terrorism is defined in the Terrorism Act 2000 as action designed to influence the government or intimidate the public, advancing a political, religious, racial, or ideological cause, involving serious violence, damage, or endangering life.

### RE's Role in Prevent

RE contributes to Prevent objectives in several ways:

**Building resilience**: High-quality RE builds pupils' resilience to extremist narratives by developing critical thinking skills, robust knowledge about religions, and appreciation for diversity.

**Safe debate**: RE classrooms provide structured opportunities to discuss controversial issues, including extremism, in safe and moderated environments.

**Challenging extremist narratives**: RE directly challenges extremist interpretations of religion by providing accurate, nuanced understanding of religious traditions. This includes challenging Islamist extremism, far-right extremism, and other forms of violent extremism.

**Identifying vulnerability**: RE teachers, through their close engagement with pupils' beliefs and values, may be well-placed to identify pupils showing signs of radicalisation. However, this must be handled carefully to avoid stigmatisation and surveillance of Muslim pupils.

### Critical Perspectives on Prevent

RE teachers should be aware of critiques of Prevent, particularly regarding:

- **Disproportionate focus on Muslims**: Critics argue Prevent disproportionately targets Muslim communities, potentially alienating the very pupils it seeks to protect.
- **Chilling effect on debate**: Concerns that Prevent may inhibit open discussion of controversial issues, particularly in relation to Palestine/Israel, foreign policy, and Islamic politics.
- **Securitisation of education**: The concern that education is being instrumentalised for security purposes, potentially compromising educational values.

Effective RE implementation of Prevent addresses these concerns by maintaining educational integrity, avoiding stereotyping, and ensuring all forms of extremism are addressed.

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Dialogical Pedagogy

Dialogical approaches, emphasising structured dialogue between pupils holding different views, are central to RE's contribution to British values. The Community of Inquiry model, derived from Philosophy for Children, creates spaces where pupils collectively investigate questions, building on each other's contributions.

Effective dialogue in RE:

- Creates safe spaces for expression of diverse views
- Teaches active listening and respectful disagreement
- Moves beyond superficial exchange to genuine engagement with difference
- Is facilitated rather than dominated by the teacher

### Phenomenological Approaches

Phenomenological RE, associated with the work of Ninian Smart and Robert Jackson, emphasises understanding religion "from the inside"—appreciating how religious phenomena appear to believers. This approach builds empathy and counters stereotyping.

In relation to British values, phenomenological approaches:

- Model respect by taking believers seriously on their own terms
- Develop skills for understanding people who are different
- Challenge simplistic or hostile representations of religion

### Critical Pedagogy

Critical approaches to RE resist indoctrination in any direction—whether religious or secular. They empower pupils to question, critique, and form independent judgments. This aligns with individual liberty and prepares pupils to resist extremist manipulation.

Critical pedagogy in RE involves:

- Teaching pupils to evaluate evidence and argument
- Encouraging questioning of all claims, including religious claims
- Developing awareness of how power operates in relation to religion
- Supporting pupils in developing their own positions

### Worldviews Pedagogy

The emerging worldviews paradigm in RE, reflected in the Commission on RE's final report (2018), expands the scope of RE beyond religions to include non-religious worldviews and to treat all worldviews as diverse, evolving, and contested. This approach particularly supports mutual respect and tolerance by:

- Giving equal status to religious and non-religious perspectives
- Treating worldviews as lived and diverse rather than monolithic
- Encouraging pupils to understand their own worldviews

## Practical Classroom Strategies

### Teaching Democracy Through RE

- **Classroom councils**: Establish RE councils that model democratic decision-making
- **Debating controversial issues**: Use formal debate structures on ethical questions
- **Mock trials**: Explore justice and law through role-play scenarios
- **Voting simulations**: Explore how religious beliefs influence political participation

### Teaching the Rule of Law

- **Comparative law exercises**: Compare religious and civil legal traditions
- **Case studies**: Examine real cases where religious freedom and civil law intersect
- **Human rights education**: Explore the human rights framework, including Article 9 (freedom of religion)
- **Justice themes**: Study concepts of justice across religious traditions

### Teaching Individual Liberty

- **Belief autobiographies**: Pupils reflect on and share their own developing beliefs
- **Safe questioning**: Create classroom norms where no question is off-limits
- **Doubt and faith**: Study how religious traditions themselves engage with doubt
- **Conscience cases**: Explore historical cases of conscience and civil disobedience

### Teaching Mutual Respect

- **Interfaith encounter**: Arrange visits to places of worship and dialogue with believers
- **Respect protocols**: Establish classroom ground rules for respectful disagreement
- **Perspective-taking exercises**: Use role-play to understand different viewpoints
- **Stereotype challenging**: Explicitly address and deconstruct religious stereotypes

### Integrating SMSC Across RE Schemes of Work

Effective RE departments audit their schemes of work to ensure SMSC opportunities are planned rather than incidental. This includes:

- Mapping SMSC opportunities against each unit of work
- Identifying British values connections in lesson plans
- Ensuring progression in SMSC development across key stages
- Assessing SMSC development alongside subject knowledge

## Assessment and Evaluation

### Assessing Values Development

Assessment of British values and SMSC development through RE should avoid simplistic approaches. It is not appropriate to grade pupils on whether they hold particular values. Instead, assessment might focus on:

**Process assessment**: Evaluating pupils' capacity to engage in respectful dialogue, to understand multiple perspectives, and to reason ethically. These are skills that can be demonstrated and developed regardless of the particular beliefs pupils hold.

**Reflection and self-assessment**: Encouraging pupils to reflect on their own SMSC development through journals, portfolios, and self-assessment frameworks. This respects individual liberty whilst promoting accountability for personal growth.

**Contributions to community**: Recognising pupils' contributions to the classroom community and beyond as evidence of social and moral development.

**Knowledge and understanding**: Assessing pupils' understanding of how British values relate to RE content—their knowledge of legal frameworks, human rights, and the relationship between religion and society.

### Monitoring and Evaluation

RE departments should establish systematic approaches to monitoring their contribution to British values and SMSC:

- Regular audits of schemes of work for SMSC coverage
- Lesson observation focusing on values promotion
- Pupil voice activities exploring experiences of British values in RE
- Review of resources to ensure they represent diverse perspectives respectfully
- Collaboration with SMSC co-ordinators and safeguarding leads

## Challenges and Tensions

### Navigating Secular and Religious Perspectives

RE must navigate between religious and secular perspectives on British values. Some religious communities may understand values such as individual liberty or democracy differently from dominant secular interpretations. RE must respect these differences whilst maintaining clarity about the legal framework within which schools operate.

This tension is particularly acute around issues such as:

- LGBTQ+ inclusion and religious teachings about sexuality
- Gender equality and religious traditions with differentiated gender roles
- Freedom of expression and religious prohibitions on blasphemy

RE's contribution is not to resolve these tensions but to provide space for pupils to understand them in all their complexity.

### Avoiding Indoctrination

A persistent risk in teaching values is that education becomes indoctrination. RE must maintain its commitment to education about religions and beliefs rather than promotion of any particular worldview, including secular liberalism. This requires:

- Presenting British values as historically and culturally contingent rather than absolute
- Acknowledging critiques of these values from various perspectives
- Respecting pupils' right to disagree with values positions as long as they understand the legal framework

### Balancing Universalism and Particularism

RE must balance universal human rights frameworks with respect for particular religious and cultural traditions. The claim that British values are "universal" can be perceived as cultural imperialism. RE can address this by:

- Exploring how different traditions arrive at similar ethical conclusions through different reasoning
- Acknowledging the historical specificity of British values
- Connecting British values to global human rights frameworks

## Conclusion

RE occupies a distinctive position in relation to British values, SMSC, and the Prevent duty. Unlike any other subject, RE is explicitly concerned with the beliefs and values that shape individuals and communities. This positioning brings both opportunities and responsibilities.

The opportunities include RE's natural alignment with values of mutual respect and tolerance, its capacity to develop the critical thinking skills that underpin individual liberty, and its contribution to understanding the rule of law in relation to religious diversity. RE provides essential education for life in a plural society.

The responsibilities include maintaining educational integrity when values education risks becoming indoctrination, ensuring that British values do not silence legitimate religious perspectives, and implementing the Prevent duty without stigmatising Muslim pupils or chilling open debate.

Effective RE in this domain requires sophisticated pedagogy—approaches that balance respect for tradition with encouragement of critical thinking, that create safe spaces for dialogue whilst challenging extremist narratives, and that develop pupils' knowledge and skills without dictating their beliefs.

When done well, RE's contribution to British values goes far beyond checkbox compliance. It helps form young people who can navigate diversity with confidence, engage with difference respectfully, think critically about complex issues, and participate actively in democratic society. These are not merely British values—they are human capabilities essential for flourishing in the twenty-first century.
