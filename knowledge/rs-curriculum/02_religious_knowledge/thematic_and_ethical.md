# Thematic and Ethical Studies in Religious Education

Thematic and ethical studies form a core component of Religious Education in UK schools, enabling pupils to engage with profound questions about human existence, morality, and society through the lens of religious and non-religious worldviews. This knowledge file explores the major thematic areas taught in English schools—relationships and families, matters of life and death, war and peace, and environmental ethics—examining both the substantive content and pedagogical approaches that support meaningful learning in these sensitive and complex domains.

## The Role of Thematic Studies in RE

### The AQA GCSE Framework

The AQA GCSE Religious Studies specification (8062) organises thematic studies into four key areas: Relationships and Families (Theme A), Religion and Life (Theme B), Religion, Peace and Conflict (Theme D), and Religion, Crime and Punishment (Theme E). These themes are assessed in Component 2, which requires students to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of religious and non-religious beliefs about the issues raised, as well as the ability to analyse and evaluate different perspectives.

According to the AQA specification, students must study both religious and non-religious beliefs, such as atheism and humanism, in contemporary British society. This requirement reflects the inclusive approach that characterises modern RE, ensuring that pupils encounter diverse perspectives rather than studying religious viewpoints in isolation. The Ofsted research review for religious education (2021) emphasises that high-quality RE enables pupils to hold informed conversations about religion and worldviews, a goal that thematic studies are particularly well-positioned to support.

### Progression from Key Stage 3 to Key Stage 4

Thematic ethical topics build upon foundations laid at Key Stage 3, where pupils typically encounter introductory exploration of values, moral questions, and religious practices. At Key Stage 4, the study becomes more systematic and academically rigorous, requiring students to engage with specific religious teachings, sacred texts, and theological arguments rather than general impressions of religious viewpoints.

Effective progression involves revisiting concepts with increasing sophistication. For example, pupils who encounter the concept of stewardship at Key Stage 3 in the context of caring for the environment will explore this concept at Key Stage 4 through examination of specific biblical texts (Genesis 1-2), theological interpretations, and contemporary application to environmental ethics. This spiral curriculum approach supports deeper conceptual understanding over time.

## Theme A: Relationships and Families

### Marriage and Family Life

Religious teachings about marriage and family life represent a foundational element of thematic RE. Across major world religions, marriage is generally understood as a significant commitment, though interpretations vary regarding its nature, purposes, and requirements. In Christianity, marriage is traditionally understood as a covenant before God, with the wedding ceremony in many denominations including vows that emphasise lifelong commitment, fidelity, and mutual support.

The AQA specification requires students to examine religious teachings about the nature and purpose of marriage, including procreation, companionship, and the legitimisation of sexual relationships. These traditional purposes are increasingly contested in contemporary society, where marriage rates have declined significantly and diverse family structures have become more prevalent. RE teaching must navigate the tension between religious traditions and contemporary social realities with sensitivity and academic rigour.

For Muslims, marriage (nikah) is considered a contract between two individuals and holds both religious and social significance. Islamic teachings emphasise marriage as the foundation of family life and the appropriate context for sexual relationships. The Qur'an describes spouses as garments for one another (Qur'an 2:187), emphasising protection, comfort, and intimacy.

### Divorce and Remarriage

Religious attitudes toward divorce vary considerably both between and within traditions. In Roman Catholic Christianity, marriage is understood as an indissoluble sacrament, and divorce is not recognised as theologically valid. The Church does, however, recognise annulment—a declaration that a valid marriage never existed due to factors present at the time of the wedding. Other Christian denominations, including the Church of England, accept divorce and remarriage under certain circumstances, recognising that relationships sometimes break down irretrievably.

Islamic law permits divorce under specific conditions, with procedures that vary between Sunni and Shia traditions. The concept of talaq (repudiation) allows a husband to divorce his wife, though various restrictions and waiting periods apply. In recent years, there has been significant discussion within Muslim communities about gender equity in divorce procedures, with some scholars arguing for expanded rights for women to initiate divorce proceedings.

Teaching about divorce in RE requires particular sensitivity, as many pupils will have direct or indirect experience of parental separation. Effective pedagogy balances academic examination of religious teachings with pastoral awareness, creating space for pupils to explore diverse perspectives while respecting personal circumstances.

### Gender Equality and Changing Attitudes

Religious teachings about gender roles and equality have evolved significantly over time, and contemporary RE must address these developments honestly. The AQA specification includes examination of religious attitudes to gender equality, recognising this as an area where traditional religious teachings often conflict with contemporary values.

Within Christianity, there are considerable variations in approach to gender roles. Some denominations, including the Roman Catholic Church and many evangelical traditions, maintain distinct roles for men and women in church leadership and family life. Other denominations, including many Anglican and Methodist congregations, have moved toward full gender equality in leadership positions and reject rigid gender role distinctions.

Islamic teachings about gender emphasise spiritual equality between men and women, with both held equally accountable before Allah. However, interpretations vary regarding social and familial roles, with some Muslim communities maintaining traditional gender divisions and others advocating for more egalitarian arrangements. The concept of qiwamah (male guardianship) has been subject to extensive contemporary reinterpretation by Muslim feminists and progressive scholars.

Teaching about gender in RE must avoid simplistic stereotypes while acknowledging that religious communities themselves are divided on these questions. The pedagogical approach should present the diversity of views within traditions, supported by engagement with sacred texts and contemporary scholarship.

### Sexual Ethics and Contemporary Debates

Thematic RE addresses sensitive topics including contraception, sexual orientation, and sex before marriage. These areas require careful handling, as they touch on personal values, family beliefs, and potentially controversial social issues. The Ofsted subject report on RE (2024) notes that in too many schools, RE is of poor quality and not fit for purpose; addressing these challenging topics with academic rigour is part of improving standards.

Christian teachings on sexual ethics have traditionally emphasised chastity before marriage and fidelity within marriage. However, there is significant diversity within Christianity, with some denominations maintaining conservative positions while others have become more affirming of diverse sexual orientations and relationships. The Church of England's Living in Love and Faith process represents an ongoing attempt to navigate these divisions within a single denomination.

Islamic teachings prohibit sexual relationships outside marriage and traditionally consider homosexual acts as sinful. However, as with Christianity, there is diversity of interpretation and practice within Muslim communities, with some Muslims arguing for more inclusive interpretations of traditional texts. Teaching in this area must present the spectrum of religious views while maintaining respect for the dignity of all pupils regardless of their background or identity.

## Theme B: Matters of Life and Death

### Sanctity of Life

The concept of sanctity of life—that human life is inherently valuable and sacred—represents a foundational principle in many religious ethical systems. For Christians, this principle derives from the belief that human beings are created in the image of God (imago Dei), as described in Genesis 1:27. This theological foundation underpins Christian opposition to practices including abortion, euthanasia, and suicide in most traditional interpretations.

The sanctity of life principle is not exclusive to Christianity. Islamic teachings similarly hold human life as sacred, with the Qur'an stating that "whoever kills a soul... it is as if he had slain mankind entirely" (Qur'an 5:32). This principle supports conservative positions on end-of-life issues, though Islamic ethics also recognise distinctions between active killing and allowing natural death to occur.

Teaching the sanctity of life requires attention to both its theological foundations and its practical implications. Students should understand how this principle functions as a starting point for ethical reasoning while also recognising that it does not resolve all ethical dilemmas. Cases where the principle comes into tension with other values—such as compassion for suffering or respect for autonomy—provide rich material for ethical analysis.

### Abortion

Abortion represents one of the most contested ethical issues in contemporary society, and RE provides an important space for students to examine religious and philosophical perspectives on this topic. The AQA specification requires students to study religious teachings about abortion, including the circumstances under which it might be considered permissible or prohibited.

Roman Catholic teaching maintains that human life begins at conception and that abortion is therefore morally equivalent to murder. This absolute prohibition extends to all circumstances, including cases of rape or when the mother's life is at risk, though the doctrine of double effect may permit actions that save the mother's life even if they result in fetal death as an unintended consequence.

Other Christian denominations take more nuanced positions. The Church of England recognises that abortion may be the lesser of two evils in certain circumstances and supports the current legal framework in England, Wales, and Scotland, which permits abortion up to 24 weeks with certain conditions. Many Protestant denominations emphasise the importance of compassion and support for women facing difficult pregnancy decisions alongside respect for potential life.

Islamic teachings on abortion vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the circumstances involved. Many Muslim scholars permit abortion in the first 120 days of pregnancy (before ensoulment occurs) when there is a valid reason, such as risk to the mother's health or severe fetal abnormality. After 120 days, abortion is generally prohibited except when necessary to save the mother's life.

### Euthanasia and End-of-Life Ethics

Euthanasia—voluntary ending of life to relieve suffering—raises profound questions about the value of life, the nature of suffering, and the limits of autonomy. The AQA specification includes examination of religious and non-religious attitudes toward euthanasia, including distinctions between active and passive euthanasia and voluntary and involuntary ending of life.

Traditional Christian teaching opposes active euthanasia based on the sanctity of life principle, holding that only God has the authority to determine when life ends. However, there is broad acceptance of passive euthanasia—allowing death to occur naturally by withdrawing or withholding life-sustaining treatment—in appropriate circumstances. The doctrine of double effect permits the administration of pain medication that may hasten death, provided the primary intention is relief of suffering rather than ending life.

Islamic ethics generally prohibit both active and passive euthanasia, emphasising that life belongs to Allah and that human beings do not have the authority to end it. However, there is some flexibility regarding the withdrawal of treatment when it merely prolongs the dying process without offering genuine benefit, provided this is not done with the intention of hastening death.

Buddhist perspectives on euthanasia are complex and varied. While Buddhist teachings emphasise non-violence (ahimsa) and the sanctity of all life, including one's own, some Buddhist ethicists argue that compassion for suffering may justify euthanasia in certain circumstances. The Dalai Lama has expressed nuanced views on this topic, acknowledging that motivation is crucial in evaluating the ethical status of euthanasia.

### Beliefs About Life After Death

Beliefs about what happens after death fundamentally shape how religious traditions approach end-of-life questions. Christian teachings about heaven, hell, and purgatory provide a framework for understanding death not as an ending but as a transition to eternal existence. This belief can provide comfort and hope for the dying and their families while also raising questions about the relationship between earthly actions and eternal destiny.

Islamic teachings about akhirah (the afterlife) include belief in paradise (Jannah) and hellfire (Jahannam), with final judgment based on Allah's mercy and the individual's faith and deeds. The concept of barzakh—a period between death and resurrection—provides a framework for understanding the state of the deceased prior to final judgment.

Teaching about life after death should address both the theological content of these beliefs and their practical significance for how believers approach death, grief, and moral decision-making. Understanding that death is not necessarily viewed as the end of existence helps students make sense of religious attitudes toward end-of-life decisions and the value placed on preparing for what comes after.

## Theme D: Religion, Peace and Conflict

### Concepts of Peace in Religious Traditions

Peace represents a central value across religious traditions, though interpretations vary regarding its nature and the means by which it should be pursued. The Hebrew concept of shalom and the Arabic salaam both convey a comprehensive vision of peace that includes not merely absence of conflict but wholeness, wellbeing, and right relationship. Understanding these rich concepts helps students appreciate that religious peace-making involves more than simply avoiding violence.

Christian teachings on peace draw on Jesus's teaching in the Beatitudes—"Blessed are the peacemakers" (Matthew 5:9)—and his instruction to love enemies and turn the other cheek. These teachings have inspired Christian pacifism while also being interpreted through the Just War tradition that acknowledges circumstances where force may be necessary to restore peace and justice.

Islamic teachings similarly emphasise peace while also acknowledging circumstances where defensive fighting may be permitted. The concept of jihad, often misunderstood in Western contexts, primarily refers to the spiritual struggle to live according to God's will. The "greater jihad" of self-discipline and moral development is distinguished from the "lesser jihad" of armed struggle, which is subject to strict ethical constraints including prohibition of targeting civilians and requirements for proportionality.

### Just War Theory

Just War Theory provides a framework for evaluating when, if ever, warfare can be morally justified. Developed initially by St Augustine and refined by Thomas Aquinas and subsequent thinkers, the theory establishes criteria for determining whether going to war is justified (jus ad bellum) and how warfare should be conducted (jus in bello).

The traditional jus ad bellum criteria include: just cause (such as self-defence or defence of the innocent), legitimate authority, right intention, last resort, reasonable prospect of success, and proportionality of ends. These criteria aim to ensure that war is not undertaken lightly or for selfish purposes but only as a necessary response to serious injustice.

Jus in bello criteria govern conduct during warfare, requiring discrimination between combatants and non-combatants (non-combatant immunity) and proportionality in the use of force. These principles underlie contemporary international humanitarian law, including the Geneva Conventions, and provide a framework for evaluating the ethical status of military actions.

Teaching Just War Theory involves both historical understanding—tracing its development from Augustine through Aquinas to contemporary applications—and contemporary case study analysis. Students should engage with real and hypothetical scenarios to apply the criteria and recognise the challenges of applying abstract principles to complex situations.

### Pacifism and Non-Violent Resistance

Pacifism—the principled refusal to participate in warfare or use violence—represents an important strand within religious ethics, particularly in Christianity, Buddhism, and Jainism. Christian pacifism draws on Jesus's teachings about non-violence and has been practised by groups including the Quakers, Mennonites, and Church of the Brethren throughout history.

The Quaker commitment to pacifism, grounded in the belief that there is "that of God in everyone," has led to significant contributions to peace-making and conflict resolution. Quakers have been involved in mediation efforts in numerous conflicts and have worked to develop non-violent approaches to social change.

Buddhist pacifism derives from the first precept against taking life, which applies to all sentient beings. This commitment has inspired Buddhist peace movements, including the engaged Buddhism of Thich Nhat Hanh during the Vietnam War and the contemporary work of the Dalai Lama for Tibetan autonomy through non-violent means.

Teaching about pacifism should include examination of both the principled foundations of non-violence and the practical challenges of maintaining pacifist commitments in a world where others may use violence. Case studies of non-violent resistance movements, including the US Civil Rights Movement led by Martin Luther King Jr. and the Indian independence movement led by Gandhi, demonstrate the potential effectiveness of non-violent approaches while also raising questions about their limitations.

### Religious Responses to Victims of War

Religious communities have historically been involved in providing aid and support to victims of warfare, and contemporary RE examines this dimension of religious practice. The AQA specification requires students to study the work of one present-day religious organisation in responding to victims of war, with organisations such as Christian Aid, Islamic Relief, and CAFOD providing case study material.

These organisations typically combine practical humanitarian assistance—providing food, shelter, medical care, and education to displaced persons—with advocacy for peace and justice. Their work reflects religious teachings about compassion for the vulnerable and the importance of working for justice, while also raising questions about the relationship between humanitarian aid and political engagement.

Teaching about religious responses to war victims provides opportunities to connect ethical theory with practical action. Students can examine how religious beliefs about human dignity, compassion, and justice translate into organisational programmes and individual volunteer commitments. This applied dimension helps students understand that religious ethics is not merely theoretical but shapes real-world responses to suffering.

## Environmental Ethics and Stewardship

### Religious Foundations for Environmental Responsibility

Environmental ethics has become an increasingly prominent area of thematic RE, reflecting growing recognition of the ecological crisis and the resources religious traditions offer for addressing it. The AQA specification includes examination of religious teachings about the relationship between humans and the environment, including the concept of stewardship that features prominently in Christian environmental ethics.

The biblical concept of stewardship derives from Genesis 2:15, where humans are placed in the Garden of Eden "to work it and take care of it." This verse has been interpreted as establishing human responsibility for creation care, though interpretations vary regarding the nature and extent of this responsibility. Some readings emphasise human dominion over nature (based on Genesis 1:28), while others stress the caretaking dimensions of the steward role.

Contemporary Christian environmental theology has developed sophisticated frameworks for understanding environmental responsibility. The concept of creation care emphasises that the natural world has intrinsic value as God's creation, not merely instrumental value for human use. This theological perspective supports environmental protection as a religious obligation rather than merely a pragmatic choice.

### Islamic Perspectives on Environmental Ethics

Islamic environmental ethics draws on concepts including khalifah (trusteeship), tawhid (unity), and mizan (balance). Humans are understood as khalifah—trustees or stewards of the earth—responsible to Allah for how they treat creation. This trusteeship implies accountability; humans will be judged on their stewardship of the resources entrusted to them.

The Qur'an emphasises the natural world as signs (ayah) of Allah's power and wisdom, inviting reflection and wonder. Mountains, rivers, plants, and animals are described as created for human benefit but also as possessing their own relationship with Allah. This perspective supports
