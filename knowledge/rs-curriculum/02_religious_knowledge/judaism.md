# Judaism: Beliefs, Practices, and Identity

Judaism stands as one of the world's oldest monotheistic religions, with a continuous history spanning over three millennia. As the foundational faith of the Abrahamic traditions, Judaism has profoundly shaped Western civilisation's ethical and spiritual landscape. For educators teaching Religious Education in UK schools, understanding Judaism requires engagement with its diverse expressions, from traditional Orthodoxy to progressive Reform movements, and recognition of how the Holocaust has fundamentally influenced contemporary Jewish identity and community life.

## Core Beliefs and Theological Foundations

### Monotheism and the Covenant

At the heart of Jewish belief lies an unwavering commitment to monotheism—the belief in one indivisible God. This concept, articulated in the Shema prayer (Deuteronomy 6:4), declares: "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one." Unlike the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, Jewish theology maintains God's absolute oneness without division or plurality.

The relationship between God and the Jewish people is understood through the concept of covenant (brit)—a sacred agreement first established with Abraham, renewed through Moses at Sinai, and extended across generations. This covenant imposes mutual obligations: God promises protection and blessing, while the Jewish people commit to observing God's commandments (mitzvot) and maintaining their distinctive way of life. The covenantal relationship is not merely historical but ongoing, binding contemporary Jews to their ancestors and descendants in an unbroken chain of tradition.

### Torah and Divine Revelation

Jewish belief centres on the Torah—often understood as the Five Books of Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy)—as the primary revelation of God's will. Orthodox Judaism regards the Torah as literally revealed by God to Moses at Mount Sinai, with every word carrying divine authority. Progressive Jewish movements interpret the Torah as inspired human encounter with the divine, allowing for historical and critical analysis while maintaining reverence for its spiritual wisdom.

Beyond the written Torah, Judaism recognises the Oral Torah—traditions, interpretations, and legal discussions eventually codified in the Talmud. This vast corpus of rabbinic literature demonstrates how Jewish practice has always involved dynamic interpretation, adapting ancient teachings to changing circumstances while maintaining continuity with the past.

### Ethical Monotheism and the Messianic Hope

Jewish theology emphasises that God's oneness implies ethical demand. The prophets of ancient Israel thundered against social injustice, insisting that ritual observance without ethical behaviour is worthless. This prophetic tradition established what scholars call "ethical monotheism"—the inseparable connection between belief in one God and commitment to justice, compassion, and human dignity.

Traditional Jewish belief includes hope for a messianic age (olam haba)—a future era of peace, justice, and universal recognition of God. Unlike Christian conceptions of individual salvation, Jewish messianism focuses on collective redemption: the restoration of the Davidic kingdom, the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem, and the establishment of God's kingdom on earth. Orthodox Jews pray daily for the coming of the Messiah, while Reform Judaism often interprets messianism metaphorically as the human pursuit of tikkun olam—repairing the world through social justice.

## Jewish Practices and Daily Life

### Shabbat: The Heart of Jewish Time

Shabbat (the Sabbath), observed from sunset Friday to nightfall Saturday, forms the rhythmic centre of Jewish life. Rooted in the creation narrative—where God rested on the seventh day—and the Exodus story—commemorating liberation from Egyptian slavery—Shabbat represents both creation and redemption, rest and freedom.

Traditional Shabbat observance involves profound restrictions on creative labour (melachah), derived from the thirty-nine categories of work prohibited in the Torah. Orthodox Jews abstain from writing, handling money, operating electrical devices, driving, and cooking. These restrictions create a sanctuary in time—a day set apart from ordinary concerns for prayer, Torah study, family meals, and restorative rest.

The arrival of Shabbat is marked by candle lighting (typically by women), recitation of kiddush (sanctification over wine), and the festive Friday evening meal featuring challah (braided bread). Saturday morning involves synagogue worship, communal Torah reading, and often a leisurely afternoon of study, conversation, and rest. Shabbat concludes with havdalah—a brief ceremony distinguishing the sacred from the ordinary, using wine, spices, and a braided candle.

Progressive Jewish communities often adopt modified Shabbat practices. Reform Jews may drive to synagogue, use musical instruments during worship, and engage in activities that enhance their spiritual experience, prioritising the values of rest, community, and holiness over strict prohibitions. The variations between Orthodox and Reform Shabbat observance illustrate broader differences in how Jewish movements balance tradition and modernity.

### Kashrut: Dietary Laws and Sacred Eating

Jewish dietary laws (kashrut) transform ordinary eating into religious practice. Kosher (kashér) means "fit" or "proper"—designating foods permissible under Jewish law and the manner of their preparation. These laws originate in the Torah, particularly Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14, with extensive rabbinic elaboration.

Key dietary prohibitions include:

- **Forbidden animals**: Only land animals with split hooves that chew the cud are permitted (cattle, sheep, goats); pigs, rabbits, and carnivores are prohibited. Only fish with fins and scales are allowed (excluding shellfish). Birds of prey are forbidden, while domestic fowl (chicken, turkey, duck) are permitted.

- **Prohibition of blood**: Consumption of blood is strictly forbidden, requiring meat to be drained, soaked in water, salted, and rinsed to remove residual blood.

- **Separation of meat and dairy**: Based on the biblical prohibition against boiling a kid in its mother's milk, Jewish law requires complete separation of meat and dairy products—including separate dishes, utensils, and waiting periods (typically three to six hours) between consuming meat and dairy.

- **Ritual slaughter**: Animals must be slaughtered humanely by a trained shochet using a sharp blade (shechitah), minimising suffering and ensuring rapid death. The meat is then inspected for disease or injury.

Orthodox households maintain rigorous kashrut observance, with separate kitchens or sections for meat and dairy, careful reading of ingredient labels, and reliance on kosher certification symbols (hechsher) on commercial products. Reform Judaism regards kashrut as a matter of individual choice—some Reform Jews maintain traditional dietary practices as expressions of Jewish identity and ethical eating, while others view these laws as historically significant but not binding.

For schools teaching Judaism, understanding kashrut is essential not merely for academic knowledge but for practical accommodation. Jewish pupils observing kashrut require careful consideration regarding school meals, cooking lessons, and food-related celebrations. Ofsted guidance on religious accommodation emphasises that schools should make reasonable adjustments to enable Jewish pupils to participate fully in school life while maintaining their religious observance.

### Prayer and Synagogue Life

Jewish prayer (tefillah) follows prescribed liturgies (siddur) developed over centuries, combining biblical passages, rabbinic blessings, and medieval poetry. Orthodox Judaism maintains gender separation in synagogue—men and women sit in distinct sections, with men leading prayers and reading from the Torah. Reform Judaism practices egalitarian worship, with men and women sitting together, both eligible for leadership roles including rabbi.

Daily prayers occur three times: morning (shacharit), afternoon (mincha), and evening (maariv). The central prayer in all services is the Amidah—eighteen blessings encompassing praise, petition, and thanksgiving. On Shabbat and festivals, the liturgy expands to include additional readings, hymns, and special prayers.

The synagogue (shul or beit knesset) serves as house of prayer, study, and community gathering. While Orthodox synagogues maintain traditional architectural features including the bimah (raised platform for Torah reading) and ark (aron kodesh) housing the Torah scrolls, Reform synagogues often adopt contemporary aesthetics while retaining these functional elements. Many Reform congregations use organs, choirs, and vernacular sermons, while Orthodox services remain entirely in Hebrew and Aramaic, unaccompanied by musical instruments (in accordance with mourning for the destroyed Temple).

## Jewish Festivals and the Sacred Calendar

### Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur: The High Holy Days

The Jewish year culminates in the High Holy Days (Yamim Noraim)—Rosh Hashanah (New Year) and Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement)—observed in early autumn (Tishrei). This ten-day period constitutes the most solemn season in Jewish life, dedicated to introspection, repentance, and spiritual renewal.

Rosh Hashanah commemorates the creation of the world and initiates a period of divine judgment. According to tradition, God opens the Book of Life on this day, inscribing the fate of every individual for the coming year. The holiday features:

- **Shofar blowing**: The ram's horn sounded in synagogue recalls biblical episodes (Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac, Sinai revelation) and awakens listeners to repentance.
- **Symbolic foods**: Apples dipped in honey express hope for a sweet year; round challah represents the cyclical nature of time and life's completeness.
- **Tashlich**: A ceremony of casting bread into flowing water, symbolically removing sins.

The ten days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are days of repentance (aseret yemei teshuvah), devoted to repairing relationships, seeking forgiveness, and spiritual preparation. Yom Kippur itself is the holiest day—a complete fast (no food or drink) from sunset to nightfall, spent primarily in synagogue prayer. The liturgy features the Kol Nidre prayer annulling vows, the confession of sins (vidui), and the closing Neilah service when the Book of Life is sealed.

Teaching the High Holy Days effectively requires sensitivity to their solemnity and significance. The UCL Centre for Holocaust Education recommends that teaching about pre-war Jewish life—including festival observance—precede any engagement with Holocaust content, establishing Jews as complex human beings with rich cultural traditions rather than reducing them merely to victims.

### Sukkot, Pesach, and Shavuot: The Pilgrimage Festivals

The Torah designates three pilgrimage festivals (shalosh regalim)—Sukkot, Pesach (Passover), and Shavuot—when ancient Israelites travelled to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices at the Temple. Each festival carries both historical and agricultural significance.

**Sukkot** (Festival of Booths) occurs five days after Yom Kippur, lasting seven days (eight outside Israel). It commemorates the Israelites' wilderness wandering while celebrating the autumn harvest. Observance includes:

- **The sukkah**: Temporary booths constructed outdoors, with roofs of branches through which stars are visible, representing the fragility and providence of wilderness existence. Orthodox families eat all meals in the sukkah; some sleep there as well.
- **The lulav and etrog**: Four species (palm branch, myrtle, willow, and citron) waved in six directions, representing God's sovereignty over creation and the unity of diverse Jewish communities.
- **Simchat Torah**: Immediately following Sukkot, this celebration marks the completion and immediate restarting of the annual Torah reading cycle, with dancing, singing, and processions with Torah scrolls.

**Pesach** (Passover) occurs in spring (Nisan), commemorating the Exodus from Egypt. The festival's central observance is the Seder—a ritual meal on the first two nights (one night in Israel) during which families retell the Exodus story using the Haggadah text. Key Seder elements include:

- **Matzah**: Unleavened bread recalling the Israelites' hasty departure without time for dough to rise.
- **The Seder plate**: Symbolic foods including bitter herbs (maror, representing slavery), charoset (sweet paste representing mortar), and a lamb shankbone (remembrance of the paschal sacrifice).
- **The Four Questions**: Traditionally asked by the youngest child, prompting explanation of the unusual practices and ensuring intergenerational transmission.

Orthodox Jews observe strict prohibitions against leavened products (chametz) throughout the eight days, with extensive kitchen preparation. Reform Jews may maintain traditional Seder observance while adapting other practices to contemporary circumstances.

**Shavuot** (Festival of Weeks) occurs seven weeks after Pesach, originally celebrating the wheat harvest, now commemorating the giving of the Torah at Sinai. Traditional observance includes all-night Torah study (tikkun leil Shavuot) and consuming dairy foods (variously explained as symbolic of the Torah's sweetness or the Israelites' dietary transition to kosher laws).

### Hanukkah and Purim: Minor Festivals

**Hanukkah** (Festival of Lights), occurring in winter (Kislev), celebrates the Maccabean revolt against Seleucid persecution in the second century BCE and the subsequent rededication of the Temple. The eight-day festival centres on lighting the menorah (hanukkiah), adding one candle each evening. Although culturally prominent due to its proximity to Christmas, Hanukkah is technically a minor festival without Sabbath-like restrictions. Fried foods (latkes, sufganiyot) commemorate the miracle of oil.

**Purim** (Adar) commemorates the deliverance of Persian Jews from annihilation through Esther's intervention, as recorded in the biblical Book of Esther. The festival involves reading the megillah (scroll) in synagogue, costume-wearing, gift-giving (mishloach manot), charity to the poor, and festive eating. The Talmud instructs Jews to become so intoxicated on Purim that they cannot distinguish between "cursed be Haman" and "blessed be Mordechai"—though this is rarely taken literally in practice.

## Orthodox and Reform Judaism: Divergent Paths

### Historical Development

Modern Judaism's major divisions emerged from the Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment) and emancipation in nineteenth-century Europe. As Jews gained civil rights and entered mainstream society, traditional practices encountered modernity's challenges. Two primary responses developed: Orthodoxy, defending traditional observance against modernity's encroachments, and Reform, adapting Judaism to contemporary conditions.

**Orthodox Judaism** insists on halachah (Jewish law) as binding and unchanging. Its emergence as an organised movement, associated with figures like Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch in Germany and the Hatam Sofer in Hungary, represented self-conscious traditionalism responding to modernist challenges. Orthodoxy itself encompasses variations:

- **Modern Orthodox**: Engages with secular education and broader society while maintaining strict halachic observance. Associated with institutions like the London School of Jewish Studies.
- **Haredi (Ultra-Orthodox)**: Maintains stricter separation from secular culture, emphasising Torah study above secular education. Includes Hasidic communities (followers of mystical pietistic movements originating in eighteenth-century Eastern Europe) and mitnagdim (opponents of Hasidism, primarily followers of the Vilna Gaon).

**Reform Judaism** (called Progressive or Liberal Judaism in Britain) emerged in Germany with the Hamburg Temple (1818) and developed significantly in America and Britain. Key principles include:

- **Autonomy**: Individual conscience determines religious practice; no binding halachah exists.
- **Adaptability**: Judaism must evolve with changing historical circumstances.
- **Ethical primacy**: Prophetic ethics take precedence over ritual observance.
- **Egalitarianism**: Complete gender equality in religious life.

### Contemporary Distinctions

British Jewry today includes multiple denominations with varying degrees of observance:

| Aspect | Orthodox | Reform | Liberal | Masorti |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|---------|
| **Biblical/Torah authority** | Divine revelation, literal | Inspired, historically situated | Human document, ethically binding | Evolving revelation, historically grounded |
| **Halachah** | Binding, detailed | Informed by tradition, not binding | Guiding principles only | Committed to halachah, with critical scholarship |
| **Gender roles** | Distinct (men and women separate) | Egalitarian | Egalitarian | Egalitarian |
| **Kosher observance** | Strict | Variable | Optional | Encouraged |
| **Shabbat restrictions** | Comprehensive | Focus on spiritual rest | Personal choice | Traditional with modern engagement |
| **Interfaith relations** | Limited | Active engagement | Active engagement | Moderate engagement |

The United Synagogue represents mainstream Orthodoxy in Britain, while Reform Synagogues of Great Britain and Liberal Judaism represent progressive movements. Masorti (Conservative) Judaism occupies a middle position, committed to traditional practice while employing historical-critical methods. The Board of Deputies of British Jews includes representatives across these denominations, though strictly Orthodox (Haredi) communities often maintain separate representative organisations.

For educational purposes, teaching Judaism requires presenting this diversity accurately. Pupils should understand that "Judaism" encompasses multiple legitimate expressions, not a monolithic entity. The BBC Bitesize RE curriculum now explicitly addresses distinctions between Orthodox and Reform practices, recognising that understanding internal diversity is essential for religious literacy.

## The Holocaust and Jewish Identity

### Historical Trauma and Collective Memory

The Holocaust (Shoah)—the systematic murder of six million Jews by Nazi Germany and collaborators between 1941 and 1945—constitutes the defining catastrophe of modern Jewish history. Its impact on Jewish identity, community, and consciousness cannot be overstated. Understanding contemporary Judaism requires engagement with how the Holocaust has reshaped Jewish self-understanding and the challenges of Holocaust education in schools.

The Holocaust's devastation extended beyond mass murder to the destruction of European Jewish civilisation—centuries of religious learning, cultural production, and communal life. Yiddish-speaking communities, Hasidic dynasties, and vibrant secular Jewish cultures were annihilated. The surviving remnant faced displacement, trauma, and the task of rebuilding amidst profound loss.

### Holocaust Education and Pedagogical Approaches

The Holocaust has been part of the National Curriculum for History since 1991, and Holocaust Memorial Day (27 January) is marked in schools across the UK. However, Holocaust education presents particular challenges for RE teachers, requiring careful integration with teaching about Judaism as a living faith.

Research by the UCL Centre for Holocaust Education (2020) found that many students approach the Holocaust with limited prior knowledge of Jewish life and culture. This knowledge deficit risks reducing Jews to one-dimensional victims and distorting understanding of both the Holocaust and Jewish identity. Effective RE teaching establishes that Jews were—and are—a diverse people with rich religious and cultural traditions.

The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) recommends that Holocaust education:

- **Establish prior learning about Jews and Judaism**: Before studying persecution, students should understand Jewish life, beliefs, and practices.
- **Use appropriate materials and language**: Avoid images or narratives that sensationalise suffering or depict Jews solely as victims.
- **Respect complexity**: Jewish responses to persecution included spiritual resistance, cultural preservation, armed rebellion, and diverse theological interpretations.
- **Connect to contemporary antisemitism**: The Holocaust is not merely historical but informs understanding of present-day hatred and discrimination.

The UCL Centre for Holocaust Education's "Subject in Focus: Religious Education" (2024) demonstrates how RE teachers can use Holocaust content to explore themes of identity, community, and belonging. By examining Nazi legislation targeting Jewish identity—restrictions on worship, practice, and community life—students utilise their RE skills to understand spiritual resistance and the meaning of religious freedom.

### Contemporary Jewish Identity and Community

Post-Holocaust Jewish identity has evolved along multiple trajectories. For some, the Shoah reinforced commitment to Jewish continuity through religious observance and communal life. For others, it provoked questioning of traditional beliefs—how could a just God permit such evil? Responses to this theological challenge include:

- **Increased secularisation**: Some Jews maintain ethnic or cultural identity while abandoning religious practice, defining Jewishness through peoplehood, ethics, or cultural heritage rather than belief.
- **Religious revival**: Conversely, some communities have experienced renewed religious commitment, viewing Jewish survival as miraculous and traditional practice as resistance to annihilation.
- **Zionism**: The establishment of Israel in 1948 was profoundly shaped by the Holocaust, representing both refuge for survivors and assertion of Jewish self-determination. British Jewish attitudes toward Israel vary considerably across denominations.

British Jewry today numbers approximately 270,000, concentrated primarily in London (particularly Stamford Hill, Golders Green, and Hendon) and Manchester. This community encompasses remarkable diversity: strictly Orthodox enclaves maintaining pre-war European customs; mainstream Orthodoxy represented by the United Synagogue; progressive communities affiliated with Reform and Liberal movements; and substantial numbers of secular or cultural Jews. The Jewish Leadership Council and Board of Deputies represent communal interests, while organisations like the Community Security Trust address security concerns, including monitoring antisemitic incidents.

Teaching about contemporary Jewish Britain helps pupils understand Judaism as a living faith, not merely a historical subject. The Jewish Museum London (now temporarily closed) and Manchester Jewish Museum offer resources for exploring Jewish life in Britain from the medieval period through contemporary immigration. The Rabbi Sacks Legacy provides free educational resources for teaching Jewish ethics and values.

## Teaching Judaism in the Classroom: Pedagogical Strategies

### Common Misconceptions and Corrections

Research and classroom experience reveal several persistent misconceptions about Judaism that RE teachers should address:

**Misconception**: "Jews believe in the Old Testament, Christians in the New."
**Correction**: Jews do not use the term "Old Testament," which implies supersession. They refer to the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible. Moreover, Jewish sacred literature extends far beyond the Bible to include Talmud, midrash, and centuries of legal and mystical writings.

**Misconception**: "Jews are waiting for Jesus to come as Messiah."
**Correction**: Jewish messianic expectation involves a human descendant of David who will restore Jewish sovereignty and establish universal peace—not Jesus. Jewish theology does not recognise Jesus as Messiah or divine.

**Misconception**: "Orthodox Judaism is authentic; Reform is watered down."
**Correction**: Both represent legitimate expressions of Jewish tradition, with Reform developing as a considered response to modernity. Neither is "more authentic"—they represent different ways of being Jewish.

**Misconception**: "The Holocaust is the most important thing about Judaism."
**Correction**: While the Shoah profoundly affects contemporary Jewish identity, Jewish history and culture span three millennia. Teaching must balance Holocaust education with exploration of the rich religious and cultural heritage that preceded and survived it.

### Progressive Learning Across Key Stages

**Key Stage 1 (ages 5-7)**: Focus on concrete practices and celebrations—Shabbat candle lighting, Hanukkah traditions, Jewish homes. Use stories from the Hebrew Bible appropriate for young children. Emphasise respect for difference and similarity to pupils' own experiences.

**Key Stage 2 (ages 7-11)**: Introduce core beliefs (one God, covenant, Torah), festival cycles (Pesach, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur), and distinctions between Orthodox and Reform practices. Use artefacts (real or reproduced)—kippah, tallit, mezuzah, seder plate. Encourage questions about how Jewish children experience school, home, and community.

**Key Stage 3 (ages 11-14)**: Develop understanding of theological concepts (covenant, election, mitzvah), historical development (diaspora, emancipation, Holocaust), and contemporary diversity (Israel, secularisation, renewal movements). Address ethical dimensions—kashrut and animal welfare, Shabbat and technology, Jewish perspectives on social justice.

**GCSE (ages 14-16)**: Exam specifications (AQA, Edexcel, OCR, WJEC) require detailed knowledge of beliefs, practices, and sources of authority. Students should understand textual foundations (Shema, Ten Commandments), worship and synagogue life, rites of passage (brit milah, bar/bat mitzvah, marriage, death), and festival observance. Comparison between Orthodox and Reform Judaism is typically required.

### Recommended Resources

- **BBC Bitesize**: Comprehensive RE resources covering Judaism across key stages, with video content and revision materials.
- **RE:Online**: Extensive Judaism resources including lesson plans, image banks, and teacher guidance.
- **TrueTube**: Short films exploring Jewish beliefs and practices, including interviews with British Jews.
- **Jewish Museum London/Manchester Jewish Museum**: Virtual resources and loan boxes for classroom use.
- **London School of Jewish Studies**: Adult education and teacher professional development.
- **UCL Centre for Holocaust Education**: Guidance on integrating Holocaust content with RE teaching.
- **Board of Deputies of British Jews**: Educational resources and school speaker programmes.

### Visiting Places of Worship

Synagogue visits provide invaluable experiential learning, though arrangements require sensitivity:

- **Orthodox synagogues**: Maintain gender separation; visitors should dress modestly (covered shoulders and knees). Men must cover heads (kippah provided). Photography generally prohibited during services.
- **Reform synagogues**: Usually more flexible regarding dress and gender mixing, though respect for worship space remains essential.

Preparation should include explanation of synagogue layout, ark, bimah, ner tamid (eternal light), and Torah scrolls. Post-visit reflection might compare synagogue with pupils' own experiences of religious spaces and consider how physical environment shapes worship.

## Conclusion

Teaching Judaism in UK schools requires engagement with a living tradition of remarkable depth, diversity, and continuity. From the daily sanctification of time through Shabbat to the annual cycles of repentance and rejoicing, Judaism offers students insights into how religious commitment shapes human existence. Understanding distinctions between Orthodox and Reform expressions demonstrates that religious traditions are not static but dynamically interpreted across generations. Recognition of the Holocaust's impact on Jewish identity acknowledges historical trauma while avoiding reduction of Judaism to victimhood.

For educators, the goal is not merely conveying information but fostering understanding—helping students appreciate how Jewish beliefs and practices create meaning, build community, and orient lives toward transcendence and ethical responsibility. In an era of increasing religious pluralism and occasional tension, quality RE teaching about Judaism contributes to social cohesion through knowledge, challenging stereotypes, and cultivating respect for Britain's diverse religious landscape.
