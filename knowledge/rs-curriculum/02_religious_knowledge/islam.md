# Islam: Core Beliefs and Practices

## Overview

Islam is one of the six major world religions studied in English primary Religious Education, representing approximately 6.5% of the population in England and Wales according to the 2021 Census (3.87 million people). As the second-largest religion in Britain after Christianity, Islam forms an essential component of any coherent RE curriculum. The religion teaches submission to the will of Allah (God) and follows the revelation given to the Prophet Muhammad in the seventh century CE in Arabia.

This knowledge file addresses the six articles of faith in Sunni Islam, the five pillars of practice, the distinction between Sunni and Shi'a traditions, and the lived experience of Muslims in Britain today. It is designed to support primary teachers in developing accurate subject knowledge and pedagogical approaches appropriate for Key Stages 1 and 2.

## The Six Articles of Faith in Sunni Islam

The six articles of faith (Arkan al-Iman) constitute the foundational beliefs of Sunni Muslims. These are derived from the Qur'an and the Hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad). Understanding these articles is essential for primary RE as they provide the theological framework within which Muslims understand their relationship with God, creation, and the afterlife.

### Tawhid: The Oneness of God

Tawhid is the absolute centrepiece of Islamic faith—the uncompromising belief in the oneness and unity of Allah. This is not merely numerical oneness but encompasses God's uniqueness in essence, attributes, and actions. The declaration "There is no god but Allah" forms the first part of the Shahadah (the Islamic declaration of faith).

For primary pupils, Tawhid can be understood as the belief that there is only one God, who created everything and has no partners, children, or equals. Allah has 99 beautiful names (Asma al-Husna) that describe His attributes—such as Ar-Rahman (The Merciful), Al-Alim (The All-Knowing), and Al-Malik (The King). Teaching about Tawhid provides opportunities to discuss how Muslims understand God's nature and how this influences their daily lives.

### Belief in Angels (Mala'ika)

Muslims believe that Allah created angels from light to serve as His messengers and servants. Unlike human beings, angels have no free will—they cannot disobey God. Key angels include Jibril (Gabriel), who revealed the Qur'an to Muhammad; Mikail (Michael), responsible for natural phenomena and provision; Israfil, who will blow the trumpet on the Day of Judgement; and Munkar and Nakir, who question the dead in their graves.

In primary RE, angels provide a fascinating point of comparison with Christian angelology while highlighting distinctly Islamic beliefs. The angel Jibril's role in revealing the Qur'an connects directly to the importance of the holy book in Muslim life.

### Belief in the Holy Books (Kutub)

Muslims believe that Allah revealed guidance to humanity through a series of holy books. The Qur'an is considered the final and complete revelation, superseding all previous scriptures. However, Muslims also honour earlier revelations: the Sahifah (Scrolls) given to Ibrahim (Abraham), the Tawrat (Torah) given to Musa (Moses), the Zabur (Psalms) given to Dawud (David), and the Injil (Gospel) given to Isa (Jesus).

Teaching about Islamic holy books offers opportunities for interfaith understanding. Primary pupils can explore similarities and differences in how Christians and Muslims view the Bible, and understand why Muslims regard the Qur'an as inimitable and untranslatable (the Arabic text is considered the actual word of God, while translations are interpretations).

### Belief in the Prophets (Rusul)

Muslims believe in all the prophets mentioned in the Qur'an, including Adam, Nuh (Noah), Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses), Dawud (David), Isa (Jesus), and Muhammad. Muhammad is regarded as the "Seal of the Prophets"—the final messenger who brought the complete and perfect revelation.

The Islamic understanding of prophethood differs from Christian conceptions in important ways. Muslims believe Jesus (Isa) was a prophet but not the Son of God or divine. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for primary teachers to avoid confusion or inappropriate conflation with Christian teachings about Jesus.

### Belief in the Day of Judgement (Akhirah)

Muslims believe in life after death, bodily resurrection, and the Day of Judgement (Yawm al-Din). On this day, all human beings will be resurrected and judged by Allah according to their faith and deeds. The righteous will enter Paradise (Jannah)—described as a garden of eternal bliss—while those who rejected faith will face punishment in Hell (Jahannam).

Teaching about Akhirah requires sensitivity, particularly regarding depictions of Hell. Primary RE should focus on the positive motivation for good behaviour—the desire to please God and attain Paradise—rather than fear-based approaches.

### Belief in Divine Decree (Qadar)

Muslims believe that Allah has complete knowledge and control over all that happens—nothing occurs without His will or permission. This belief in predestination coexists with the understanding that human beings have free will and are responsible for their choices. This apparent paradox is understood differently within Islamic theology.

For primary pupils, this can be introduced as the belief that God knows everything that will happen and has a plan for the universe, while humans still make their own choices and are responsible for their actions.

## The Five Pillars of Islam

The Five Pillars (Arkan al-Islam) are the obligatory acts of worship that form the framework of Muslim religious life. They are binding on all adult Muslims who are physically and financially able. In primary RE, the Five Pillars provide concrete practices that pupils can understand, observe, and respect.

### Shahadah: The Declaration of Faith

The Shahadah is the foundational statement of Islam: "Ashhadu an la ilaha ill-Allah, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh" ("I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and messenger"). Sincerely reciting this statement with understanding and conviction makes a person a Muslim.

In primary teaching, the Shahadah introduces pupils to the centrality of faith commitment. Teachers should explain that this is not merely a statement but a lifelong commitment that shapes a Muslim's entire way of life. Displaying the Shahadah in Arabic script (while explaining that translation is necessary for understanding) introduces pupils to the sacred status of Arabic in Islam.

### Salah: The Five Daily Prayers

Salah is the ritual prayer performed five times daily: Fajr (dawn), Dhuhr (midday), Asr (afternoon), Maghrib (sunset), and Isha (night). Before praying, Muslims perform wudu (ritual washing of hands, face, arms, head, and feet). The prayers involve specific physical postures (standing, bowing, prostrating, sitting) accompanied by recitations from the Qur'an in Arabic.

For primary pupils, observing or participating in (respectfully) the movements of salah, understanding the timings (perhaps relating them to the school day), and learning about the purpose of prayer as connection with God are valuable learning experiences. The direction of prayer (qibla) towards Mecca introduces the concept of the ummah (worldwide Muslim community) praying in unity.

### Zakah: Almsgiving

Zakah is the obligatory giving of a portion of one's wealth (typically 2.5% of accumulated wealth above a threshold) to those in need. This is not charity (sadaqah) but a religious duty and one of the mechanisms for wealth distribution in Islamic society. Zakah literally means "purification"—giving purifies the remainder of one's wealth.

Primary RE can connect Zakah to broader themes of charity, justice, and caring for others. Pupils can understand this as a way Muslims show gratitude for what they have been given by sharing with those less fortunate. Calculating simple percentages in context can integrate mathematics with RE learning.

### Sawm: Fasting During Ramadan

Sawm is the fasting from dawn to sunset during the month of Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Muslims abstain from food, drink, smoking, and marital relations during daylight hours. Fasting is obligatory for adults, with exemptions for children, the elderly, pregnant or nursing women, travellers, and those who are ill.

Ramadan is a particularly important topic for primary RE because it occurs annually and affects Muslim pupils directly. Teaching about Ramadan should include the spiritual purposes (self-discipline, empathy with the hungry, increased devotion), the celebration of Eid al-Fitr at its conclusion, and practical considerations for schools (avoiding scheduling strenuous activities or food-based lessons during fasting hours).

### Hajj: Pilgrimage to Mecca

Hajj is the pilgrimage to Mecca that every Muslim must undertake at least once in their lifetime if they are physically and financially able. It takes place during the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar (Dhu al-Hijjah) and involves a series of rituals performed over several days, including circling the Ka'bah (the cubic building believed to have been built by Ibrahim), standing at the plain of Arafat, and symbolically stoning the devil.

For primary pupils, Hajj can be taught through the story of Ibrahim and his family, the concept of pilgrimage as a spiritual journey, and the unity of Muslims from all nations gathering as equals. The symbolic meanings of the rituals—sacrifice, obedience, temptation, and devotion—are accessible to children.

## Sunni and Shi'a: Two Major Traditions

The Muslim community (ummah) is broadly divided into two main branches: Sunni (approximately 85-90% of Muslims worldwide) and Shi'a (approximately 10-15%). Understanding this distinction is essential for accurate primary RE, though it should be taught sensitively without suggesting one is "correct" and the other incorrect.

### Historical Origins

The division originated after the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 CE regarding leadership of the Muslim community. Sunnis believed the leader (Caliph) should be elected from among qualified candidates, while Shi'as believed leadership should pass to Ali (the Prophet's cousin and son-in-law) and his descendants (Imams).

### Theological Differences

**The Five Pillars vs. Ten Obligatory Acts:** While both Sunni and Shi'a Muslims observe the five pillars, Twelver Shi'a (the largest Shi'a group) also emphasise five additional obligations known collectively as the Ten Obligatory Acts. These include khums (a 20% tax on certain profits), jihad (struggle in the way of God), enjoining good and forbidding evil, and loving the Prophet's family (Ahl al-Bayt).

**Articles of Faith:** Shi'a Islam has five roots of religion (Usul al-Din) rather than six articles: Tawhid, Adl (divine justice), Nubuwwah (prophethood), Imamah (leadership of the Imams), and Mi'ad (resurrection). The concept of Imamah—the belief that Allah appointed infallible Imams to guide the community after the Prophet—is central to Shi'a identity.

**Practices:** Shi'a Muslims often combine some prayers, perform prostration on clay tablets (turbah), and commemorate the martyrdom of Imam Husayn at Karbala (Ashura) with particular intensity.

### Teaching Sunni-Shi'a Differences in Primary RE

Primary pupils need a simplified but accurate understanding: Muslims agree on the fundamental beliefs (one God, Muhammad as prophet, the Qur'an) but have different traditions about leadership and some practices. Teachers should avoid presenting the split as similar to the Protestant-Catholic division in Christianity, as the theological and historical contexts differ significantly.

Most Muslims in Britain are Sunni, with significant communities following various traditions including Hanafi, Shafi'i, and Salafi schools of thought. Shi'a communities also exist, particularly in cities with diverse Muslim populations. Where possible, inviting Muslim visitors from both traditions (or ensuring materials represent both) provides authentic learning experiences.

## Islam in Britain

### Demographics and Communities

According to the 2021 Census, Muslims constitute 6.5% of the population of England and Wales (3.87 million people), an increase from 4.9% in 2011. The Muslim population is ethnically diverse: the largest groups are of Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Indian, Arab, Somali, Turkish, and Afro-Caribbean heritage. This diversity reflects different immigration patterns post-World War II, including labour migration from South Asia from the 1950s onwards, refugees from various conflicts, and more recent arrivals from across the Muslim world.

Muslim communities are concentrated in urban areas, particularly London (where 15% of the population is Muslim), the West Midlands, West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, and Lancashire. However, Muslims live in all parts of the UK, and many small towns and rural areas have established Muslim communities.

### Mosques and Institutions

By 2007, there were over 1,500 mosques in the UK, with numbers continuing to grow. Mosques serve not only as places of worship but as community centres, educational institutions (madrasahs or supplementary schools), and welfare hubs. Major mosques include the East London Mosque, Birmingham Central Mosque, Manchester Central Mosque, and the Baitul Futuh Mosque in London (the largest in Western Europe).

The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), founded in 1997, is the largest umbrella organisation representing British Muslims, though it does not represent all Muslims and some groups maintain separate organisations. The Muslim Association of Britain, the British Muslim Forum, and numerous other organisations represent different theological, ethnic, and political perspectives within the community.

### Islamic Education in Britain

Muslim education in the UK operates at several levels:

**Supplementary Schools:** Many Muslim children attend maktab or madrasah classes in the evenings or weekends, where they learn Qur'anic Arabic, Islamic studies, and sometimes community languages (Urdu, Bengali, Somali, etc.).

**Independent Schools:** There are over 140 Muslim independent schools in the UK, ranging from small local institutions to established schools with strong academic reputations.

**State-Funded Schools:** A small number of state-funded Muslim schools exist, including some with voluntary aided status. These schools follow the National Curriculum while providing Islamic education and an Islamic ethos.

**RE in Mainstream Schools:** All state-funded schools must teach RE, and Islam must be included in the locally agreed syllabus (or equivalent for academies and free schools). The lived religion approach, recommended by the Commission on RE (CoRE) 2018, encourages teaching about Islam through the lived experiences of Muslims in Britain today.

### Lived Islam in British Context

Teaching Islam effectively requires moving beyond abstract theology to understand how Muslims live their faith in contemporary Britain. This includes:

**Navigating Religious Practice:** British Muslims balance religious obligations with life in a secular, majority non-Muslim society. This includes arranging for prayer times at work or school, finding halal food, observing Ramadan within the British daylight hours (which can be very long in summer), and organising Eid celebrations that may not align with school holidays.

**Diversity Within Diversity:** British Muslims are not a monolithic group. There are significant differences based on ethnicity, theological tradition, religious observance level, generational status, and regional identity. Some British Muslims are highly observant, while others may identify culturally as Muslim while not practising all religious requirements.

**Contribution to British Life:** Muslims have made significant contributions to British society in business, politics, sports, arts, medicine, education, and public service. Teaching about Muslims as active, contributing citizens—not merely as members of a religious minority—supports inclusive education.

**Challenges and Prejudice:** British Muslims face significant Islamophobia and discrimination. The Runnymede Trust (2017) found that Muslims experience high levels of hate crime, employment discrimination, and negative media representation. Ofsted (2021) noted that RE has a crucial role in challenging stereotypes and building understanding.

## Teaching Islam in Primary RE: Pedagogical Approaches

### The Three Types of Knowledge

Ofsted's Research Review Series: Religious Education (2021) identifies three types of knowledge pupils need: substantive knowledge (knowledge about religious traditions), ways of knowing (how knowledge is established in RE), and personal knowledge (pupils' own reflections and development). Effective Islam teaching should address all three.

### Age-Appropriate Progression

**Key Stage 1 (Ages 5-7):** Focus on concrete, experiential learning. Pupils can learn about Muslim families, visit a mosque, handle artefacts (with respect), and hear stories from the life of Muhammad and other prophets. The Five Pillars can be introduced as "five important things Muslims do."

**Lower Key Stage 2 (Ages 7-9):** Develop understanding of beliefs and practices in more depth. Pupils can explore the meanings behind the Five Pillars, compare Muslim and Christian beliefs about God and Jesus, and investigate the diversity of Muslim communities in their local area.

**Upper Key Stage 2 (Ages 9-11):** Engage with more complex concepts including the Sunni-Shi'a distinction, Islamic ethical teachings, and issues faced by Muslims in Britain. Pupils can engage in discussions about respect for religious diversity and challenging prejudice.

### Using Authentic Voices

The Religion and Worldviews approach emphasises learning from religion as well as about religion. Where possible, Muslim pupils, parents, or community members should contribute to RE lessons. If this is not possible, high-quality video resources, children's books by Muslim authors, and virtual tours of mosques provide authentic perspectives.

### Handling Sensitive Issues

Teaching Islam requires sensitivity to several issues:

**Stereotypes and Misconceptions:** Common misconceptions include associating Islam with terrorism, viewing Muslim women as universally oppressed, or regarding Islam as "foreign" rather than British. Teachers must actively challenge these stereotypes through accurate teaching and diverse representation.

**The Status of the Qur'an:** The Qur'an is treated with extreme reverence by Muslims. It is kept on the highest shelf, wrapped in cloth, never placed on the floor, and hands are washed before touching it. Non-Muslims should handle English translations only, with clean hands and respect. Arabic Qur'ans should not be handled by non-Muslims without invitation.

**Images of the Prophet Muhammad:** Most Muslims consider any visual depiction of the Prophet Muhammad to be deeply disrespectful. While some historical Islamic art depicts figures (particularly in Persian and Mughal traditions), many contemporary Muslims, especially those influenced by Salafi interpretations, reject all figural representation of prophets. Teachers should never display or request pupils to create images of Muhammad. Alternative approaches include using calligraphy, geometric patterns, or simply referring to "the Prophet Muhammad" without visual representation.

## Common Misconceptions About Islam

Primary teachers need to be aware of common misconceptions that pupils may bring to the classroom and actively work to correct them through accurate teaching.

### Islam as a Foreign or Arab Religion

While Islam originated in Arabia and Arabic is the language of the Qur'an, only about 20% of the world's Muslims are Arab. The largest Muslim populations are in Indonesia, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. In Britain, Muslims come from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Teaching about Islam as a British religion practised by fellow citizens—not as something "foreign"—is essential for inclusive education.

### Confusing Cultural Practices with Religious Requirements

Many practices associated with Muslims in the media or popular imagination are cultural traditions rather than religious requirements. These include arranged marriages (practised by many communities including non-Muslims), female genital mutilation (condemned by Islamic scholars and illegal in the UK), and specific styles of dress (which vary enormously by culture and individual choice). Teachers should distinguish between what the religion actually teaches and cultural practices that vary across Muslim communities.

### The Meaning of Jihad

The word "jihad" literally means "struggle" or "effort" and primarily refers to the internal spiritual struggle to live a good Muslim life. The "greater jihad" is the struggle against one's own negative tendencies; the "lesser jihad" may involve armed struggle in specific, limited circumstances with strict ethical rules. The vast majority of Muslims reject the use of the term to justify terrorism. Teaching about jihad should focus on its primary meaning of spiritual striving.

### Muslim Women as Oppressed

While some Muslim women do experience oppression (as do women in all communities), the stereotype of universal Muslim female victimhood is inaccurate and harmful. Many Muslim women choose to wear hijab or other forms of dress as expressions of faith and identity. Muslim women in Britain have achieved significant success in education, business, politics, and the arts. RE teaching should present diverse Muslim women's voices and experiences.

### Islam and Violence

Media coverage often associates Islam with terrorism and violence. While extremist groups claiming Islamic justification exist, they represent a tiny fraction of the world's 1.9 billion Muslims and are rejected by the vast majority of Islamic scholars and ordinary Muslims. The Qur'an's teachings on warfare are context-specific and subject to extensive scholarly interpretation. RE should teach about Islam as it is lived by ordinary Muslims, not through the lens of extremism.

## Progression in Learning About Islam

### Early Years Foundation Stage

In Reception, children should encounter Islam through stories, artefacts, and meeting Muslim people. Focus on developing positive attitudes and beginning vocabulary. Questions to explore: What do Muslims believe? How do Muslim families celebrate special times?

### Key Stage 1

By the end of Year 2, pupils should:
- Know that Muslims believe in one God called Allah
- Identify the Five Pillars as important Muslim practices
- Recognise key artefacts such as prayer mats, Qur'an stands, and prayer beads
- Describe what happens during Ramadan and Eid
- Show respect for Muslim beliefs and practices

### Lower Key Stage 2

By the end of Year 4, pupils should:
- Explain the meanings of the Five Pillars in simple terms
- Identify some of the six articles of faith
- Compare Muslim and Christian beliefs about God and Jesus
- Describe what happens in a mosque
- Recognise the diversity of Muslim communities in Britain

### Upper Key Stage 2

By the end of Year 6, pupils should:
- Explain the six articles of faith and their significance for Muslims
- Understand the distinction between Sunni and Shi'a Islam
- Discuss ethical teachings from the Qur'an and Hadith
- Analyse how Muslims balance religious practice with life in secular Britain
- Evaluate the contribution of Muslims to British society
- Challenge stereotypes and misconceptions about Islam

**RE:Quest** (www.re-quest.org.uk) offers child-friendly information about Islam specifically designed for primary RE.

## Assessment Approaches

Effective assessment in RE about Islam should evaluate three dimensions:

### Knowledge and Understanding

Can pupils accurately describe Muslim beliefs and practices? Do they use correct terminology? Can they explain the significance of the Five Pillars or the meaning of Tawhid?

Example assessment task: "Explain why the Five Pillars are important to Muslims. Use at least three specific examples."

### Critical Thinking

Can pupils compare Islamic beliefs with other worldviews? Can they identify similarities and differences between Muslim and Christian beliefs about God? Can they evaluate different interpretations of Islamic practices?

Example assessment task: "Muslims and Christians both believe in God, but they understand God differently. Explain two differences in how Muslims and Christians think about God."

### Personal Reflection

Can pupils reflect on what they have learned about Islam and how it relates to their own understanding of the world? Can they articulate respect for beliefs different from their own?

Example assessment task: "Learning about Ramadan has helped me understand... [pupil completes sentence and explains their thinking]."

## Cross-Curricular Connections

### Literacy

The Qur'an is regarded by Muslims as the finest Arabic literature, and its poetic qualities have inspired countless writers. Studying Islamic stories, including the lives of the prophets, provides rich material for narrative writing. Calligraphy as an art form connects to handwriting and presentation skills.

### Mathematics

The Islamic world made significant contributions to mathematics, including algebra and the number system we use today. Geometric patterns in Islamic art provide opportunities to explore symmetry, tessellation, and shape. Calculating Zakah percentages links mathematics to real-world religious practice.

### Art and Design

Islamic art is characterised by geometric patterns, arabesques, and calligraphy due to the aniconic tendencies in many Muslim traditions. Studying Islamic art develops understanding of pattern, symmetry, and the relationship between art and religious belief.

### Geography

Mapping the Muslim world introduces pupils to countries across Africa, Asia, and Europe. Understanding the direction of prayer (qibla) towards Mecca involves spatial awareness and map skills. The Hajj pilgrimage provides opportunities to explore Saudi Arabian geography and the challenges of mass religious gatherings.

### History

The rapid expansion of Islam in the seventh and eighth centuries, the Islamic Golden Age of science and learning, and the Crusades are all significant historical topics. The history of Muslim settlement in Britain, from the Victorian era to the present day, contributes to understanding of migration and community formation.

## Conclusion

Teaching Islam effectively in primary RE requires accurate subject knowledge, sensitivity to the diverse ways Muslims practise their faith, and commitment to challenging stereotypes. The six articles of faith provide the theological foundation, the Five Pillars offer concrete practices to observe and understand, and knowledge of Sunni-Shi'a distinctions ensures accurate representation of the religion's diversity.

Understanding Islam in its British context—recognising that Muslims have been part of British society for generations and make significant contributions to national life—is essential for preparing pupils to live in a diverse, multi-religious society. The Religion and Worldviews approach, emphasising lived experience alongside theological content, supports pupils in developing both knowledge and respect.

With approximately 6.5% of the English and Welsh population identifying as Muslim, and with Muslim pupils in most primary schools, RE about Islam is not simply academic study—it is preparation for living well together in contemporary Britain.
