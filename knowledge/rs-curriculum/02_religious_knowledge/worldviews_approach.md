# The Worldviews Approach in Religious Education

## Introduction: The Commission on Religious Education (2018)

In September 2018, the Commission on Religious Education (CoRE) published its landmark final report, *Religion and Worldviews: The Way Forward—A National Plan for RE*. This report represented the most significant reconceptualisation of Religious Education in England since the 1944 Education Act, proposing a fundamental shift from the traditional "world religions" paradigm to a broader, more inclusive "religion and worldviews" approach.

The Commission, established by the Religious Education Council of England and Wales (REC) in 2016, brought together leading academics, practitioners, and representatives from faith and belief communities. Chaired by the Reverend Dr John Hall (then Dean of Westminster), the Commission was tasked with reviewing the purpose, scope, and quality of RE in English schools and making recommendations for its future development. Its work responded to mounting concerns about the marginalisation of RE, the variability in quality between schools, and the increasing disconnect between traditional RE curricula and the complex religious and non-religious landscape of contemporary Britain.

The 2018 report made eleven recommendations, the centrepiece of which was the proposed "National Entitlement"—a statutory guarantee that every pupil in every publicly funded school would receive high-quality education in religion and worldviews. This entitlement would apply to all schools, including faith schools and academies, and would significantly expand the scope of what is taught under the RE umbrella.

## Defining "Worldview": A Conceptual Shift

### From World Religions to Worldviews

The traditional "world religions" approach, which has dominated RE since the 1970s, typically focused on the "big six" world religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sikhism), often presenting them as discrete, internally coherent systems of belief and practice. Pupils would study each religion separately, learning about its founder, sacred texts, places of worship, key beliefs, festivals, and rituals.

The worldviews approach, by contrast, treats "worldview" as a broader category that encompasses both religious and non-religious ways of understanding and engaging with reality. A worldview, in the Commission's definition, is "a way of viewing, interpreting, and experiencing the world which is underpinned by a set of beliefs and values" (CoRE 2018, p. 26). This definition deliberately includes:

- **Religious worldviews**: Traditional religious traditions such as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, and Sikhism, as well as smaller religious communities like Jainism, Zoroastrianism, and the Bahá'í Faith.
- **Non-religious worldviews**: Secular humanism, atheism, agnosticism, naturalism, and other philosophical positions that provide frameworks for meaning-making without reference to the supernatural.
- **Diaspora and hybrid identities**: The complex, often syncretic religious identities that emerge in multicultural contexts, where individuals may draw on multiple traditions or adapt their heritage faith to British contexts.

### The Rationale for Change

The Commission argued that the world religions approach no longer adequately represented the reality of religious and belief diversity in contemporary Britain. Census data, surveys of religious affiliation, and ethnographic research all pointed to a society characterised by:

- **Declining institutional religiosity**: While a majority of the British population still identifies with Christianity, regular church attendance has fallen dramatically, and many hold what might be called "believing without belonging" positions.
- **Rising "nones"**: Those identifying as having no religion have grown to represent a significant proportion of the population, particularly among younger cohorts.
- **Complex, multiple, and fluid identities**: Many individuals, particularly from diaspora communities, hold hybrid or syncretic identities that do not fit neatly into the categories of traditional world religions.
- **Lived diversity**: The reality of religious and belief diversity in most British schools and communities goes far beyond the "big six" model, encompassing a rich tapestry of beliefs, practices, and worldviews.

As Theos Think Tank noted in its response to the Commission, "The focus should not be so much on the institutional version as on the lived experience of adherents" (Theos 2020). This recognition—that official doctrine and everyday practice often diverge significantly—became central to the worldviews approach.

## Institutional and Personal Worldviews

A crucial conceptual distinction introduced by the Commission is between **institutional** (or organised) and **personal** worldviews. This binary has become a foundational organising principle for the religion and worldviews approach, helping teachers and pupils navigate the complex terrain between collective tradition and individual belief.

### Institutional Worldviews

Institutional worldviews refer to the organised, community-based systems of meaning that have developed over time through the collective efforts of religious and philosophical traditions. They are characterised by:

- **Shared narratives and texts**: Sacred scriptures, foundational stories, and canonical literature that provide a common reference point for community members.
- **Established practices and rituals**: Regular worship patterns, lifecycle ceremonies, ethical codes, and communal observances that structure religious life.
- **Authority structures**: Hierarchies of knowledge and interpretation—priests, scholars, leaders, and institutions—that maintain doctrinal coherence and community boundaries.
- **Material and spatial dimensions**: Places of worship, sacred sites, religious art and architecture, and material culture that embody and communicate worldview commitments.
- **Intergenerational transmission**: Educational systems, family practices, and community institutions that pass worldview knowledge and commitment from one generation to the next.

The study of institutional worldviews corresponds broadly to the traditional world religions approach, focusing on what the Commission calls "organised" or "community" worldviews. However, the worldviews approach insists that these institutions cannot themselves "inhabit" worldviews—only individuals can do so through their personal engagement with reality (ResearchGate 2021).

### Personal Worldviews

Personal worldviews, by contrast, refer to the unique, individual configurations of belief, value, and practice through which each person makes sense of their experience. As the Commission notes, "A person's worldview is likely to be made up of many different influences and elements" (CoRE 2018, p. 26). These may include:

- **Negotiated commitments**: The selective, sometimes creative ways in which individuals engage with the institutional traditions they encounter—accepting some elements, modifying others, and rejecting still more.
- **Lived experience**: The ways in which individuals' daily lives, relationships, challenges, and contexts shape their worldview commitments.
- **Multiple belonging**: The tendency for individuals, particularly in pluralistic societies, to draw on multiple sources—religious, philosophical, cultural, scientific—in constructing their personal worldview.
- **Dynamic development**: The recognition that personal worldviews are not static but evolve over time in response to life experiences, education, and changing circumstances.

The Commission argues that effective RE must attend to both dimensions—helping pupils understand the organised traditions they encounter (institutional worldviews) while also recognising the diversity of how individuals actually inhabit and negotiate those traditions (personal worldviews).

### The Interplay Between Institutional and Personal

Crucially, the worldviews approach does not treat institutional and personal worldviews as separate categories but as mutually constitutive. Institutions provide the "agreed stories and practices" that individuals draw upon, adapt, and sometimes resist in forming their personal worldviews. Conversely, institutions are themselves dynamic, evolving through the collective practices and reinterpretations of their members over time.

This interplay has significant pedagogical implications. Rather than presenting religions as fixed, homogeneous systems, teachers are encouraged to explore:

- **Diversity within traditions**: The range of beliefs, practices, and interpretations that exist within any given institutional worldview—between denominations, cultural contexts, and individual believers.
- **Orthodoxy and heterodoxy**: The ongoing negotiations between official doctrine and lived practice, and how communities manage internal diversity and dissent.
- **Syncretism and hybridity**: The creative combinations of elements from multiple traditions that characterise many individuals' personal worldviews, particularly in diaspora and multicultural contexts.
- **Generational change**: How worldviews are transmitted, transformed, and sometimes rejected across generations, particularly in contexts of migration and cultural change.

## Lived Religion: Theoretical Foundations

The worldviews approach draws heavily on the academic field of "lived religion" (sometimes called "everyday religion"), which emerged in religious studies from the 1990s onwards. This theoretical framework, associated particularly with the work of American scholar Robert Orsi, represents a paradigm shift in how religion is studied and understood.

### Robert Orsi and the Study of Lived Religion

Robert Orsi, Professor Emeritus of Religious Studies at Northwestern University, has been the most influential theorist of lived religion. His work challenges what he sees as the "top-down" approach of much religious studies scholarship, which privileges official doctrine, institutional structures, and elite practitioners over the everyday religious lives of ordinary people.

Orsi's formulation of lived religion is worth quoting at length:

> "The key questions concern what people do with religious idioms, how they use them, what they make of themselves and their worlds with them, and how, in turn, men, women, and children are fundamentally shaped by the worlds they are making as they make these worlds. There is no religion apart from this, no religion that people have not taken up in their hands." (Orsi, quoted in Religious Worlds NYC)

This perspective—often summarised as "religion is what people do, not just what they believe"—has profound implications for RE pedagogy. It suggests that:

- **Practice precedes belief**: Religious identity is formed and expressed primarily through embodied practices, relationships, and material engagements rather than abstract doctrinal assent.
- **Agency and creativity**: Religious practitioners are not passive recipients of tradition but active agents who interpret, adapt, and sometimes subvert inherited practices.
- **Context matters**: Religious practice is always situated in specific social, cultural, and material contexts that shape how traditions are lived out.
- **The mundane is sacred**: Everyday practices—cooking, parenting, healing, working—can be sites of profound religious meaning and engagement.

### Nancy Ammerman and Everyday Religion

While Orsi represents what some scholars call the "radical" wing of lived religion scholarship, sociologist Nancy Ammerman has developed a more moderate, methodologically focused approach that she terms "everyday religion." Ammerman argues for studying religion as it is actually practised by "the American mainstream"—ordinary people whose religious lives may be messy, inconsistent, and hybrid but are no less meaningful for that.

Ammerman's work has influenced RE scholarship in Britain by providing tools for researching and representing the complex, often contradictory religious lives of pupils and their communities. Her emphasis on narrative and biography as windows into lived religion has informed approaches to RE that prioritise personal storytelling and case studies over abstract systematisation.

### Lived Religion in the Classroom

Translating lived religion theory into classroom practice involves several shifts:

**From texts to practices**: Rather than beginning with sacred texts and doctrinal summaries, teachers might begin with the everyday practices of religious communities—how they eat, dress, celebrate, mourn, and mark time. Texts are then encountered as resources for and products of these practices rather than as abstract repositories of belief.

**From uniformity to diversity**: The lived religion approach foregrounds the diversity of belief and practice within traditions. Rather than presenting "Christians believe..." or "Muslims do...", teachers explore the range of Christian or Muslim belief and practice, attending to how different communities, contexts, and individuals inhabit their traditions differently.

**From belief to embodiment**: Lived religion emphasises the embodied, sensory, and material dimensions of religious life. RE lessons might include attention to religious food practices, dress, gesture, music, and art as primary expressions of worldview, not merely illustrations of belief.

**From past to present**: While historical depth is important, lived religion prioritises contemporary practice—how traditions are being lived out now, in pupils' own communities and contexts. This often involves engaging with local religious communities, inviting visitors, and using ethnographic methods.

## The National Entitlement: Eleven Recommendations

The centrepiece of the Commission's report is the proposed National Entitlement, accompanied by eleven recommendations for reform. While the full implementation of these recommendations requires legislative change that has not yet occurred, they provide a framework for understanding the worldviews approach and its implications for curriculum design.

### Recommendation 1: A New Name

The Commission recommended that the subject be renamed "Religion and Worldviews" to better reflect its expanded scope. This recommendation has been partially adopted by some schools and local authorities, though the legal name remains "Religious Education" pending statutory change.

### Recommendation 2: A Statutory National Entitlement

The core recommendation proposes that a National Entitlement to the study of Religion and Worldviews should become statutory for all pupils in all publicly funded schools, including academies and free schools. This entitlement would guarantee:

- **Time**: Sufficient curriculum time for high-quality study (the Commission suggested a minimum of 5% of curriculum time).
- **Content**: Access to the full breadth of religious and non-religious worldviews outlined in the National Entitlement content framework.
- **Progression**: A coherent programme of study from ages 5 to 18, with appropriate depth and challenge at each key stage.
- **Assessment**: Regular, meaningful assessment of pupils' progress in understanding worldviews.

### Recommendation 3: Content Framework

The Commission proposed a detailed content framework organised around three domains of knowledge and understanding:

1. **Substantive knowledge**: Understanding the beliefs, practices, and traditions of specific religious and non-religious worldviews.
2. **Disciplinary knowledge**: Understanding how knowledge about worldviews is constructed and contested—drawing on theology, philosophy, human sciences, and other disciplinary approaches.
3. **Personal knowledge**: Understanding one's own worldview and how it relates to the diversity of worldviews encountered.

### Recommendations 4-11: Implementation and Support

The remaining recommendations addressed practical matters of implementation:

- **Professional development**: Significant investment in teacher training and continuing professional development.
- **Resources**: Development of high-quality teaching resources reflecting the worldviews approach.
- **Assessment**: Reform of assessment arrangements, including the development of national standards.
- **Inspection**: Strengthened inspection of RE by Ofsted and the SIAMS framework for church schools.
- **Local determination**: Retention of local determination within a national framework, with strengthened Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education (SACREs).
- **Post-16 provision**: Guarantee of Religion and Worldviews education for all students to age 18, including those in sixth forms and colleges.
- **Accountability**: Schools required to publish detailed statements about how they meet the National Entitlement.

## Practical Implementation: Teaching the Worldviews Approach

### Curriculum Design Principles

Implementing the worldviews approach in practice requires careful curriculum design that translates the Commission's vision into coherent programmes of study. Key principles include:

**Breadth and balance**: The curriculum should include both religious and non-religious worldviews in ways that reflect their relative prevalence in society while also ensuring pupils encounter worldviews different from their own. The Commission suggests that "non-religious worldviews such as Humanism, Secularism, Atheism, and Agnosticism should be studied in a manner that reflects their significance in society and in many pupils' own lives" (CoRE 2018, p. 72).

**Depth as well as breadth**: Rather than superficial coverage of many worldviews, the curriculum should provide opportunities for in-depth study that allows pupils to understand the complexity and internal diversity of traditions.

**Local and global**: The curriculum should connect local religious and belief landscapes—pupils' immediate communities—with global patterns and developments.

**Interleaving**: Rather than studying worldviews in isolation, the curriculum should create opportunities for comparison, connection, and thematic exploration across traditions.

### Pedagogical Strategies

The worldviews approach implies several shifts in classroom pedagogy:

**Case study methodology**: In-depth exploration of specific examples—particular communities, individuals, or practices—rather than abstract generalisation. This might involve ethnographic-style case studies of local religious communities or biographical explorations of individuals' worldview journeys.

**Phenomenological approaches**: Methods that seek to understand worldviews from the inside, attending to how practitioners themselves understand and experience their traditions. This requires what the Commission calls "interpretive approaches" that take seriously the perspectives of believers.

**Dialogical practices**: Creating spaces for dialogue—not debate or argument—between different worldview perspectives, including opportunities for pupils to articulate their own positions and engage respectfully with difference.

**Critical engagement**: Developing pupils' capacity to critically evaluate truth claims, ethical positions, and arguments from a range of worldviews, while maintaining respectful engagement with those who hold different views.

**First-person voice**: Using materials that feature practitioners speaking in their own voices—autobiography, interview, testimony—rather than third-person description.

### Addressing Non-Religious Worldviews

The inclusion of non-religious worldviews is one of the most significant and sometimes controversial elements of the worldviews approach. Effective teaching in this area requires:

**Avoiding trivialisation**: Non-religious worldviews should be taken seriously as coherent, substantive positions with rich intellectual traditions—not reduced to "not believing in God" or "being normal."

**Internal diversity**: Just as religious traditions contain significant diversity, so too do non-religious worldviews. Humanism, existentialism, naturalism, atheism, and agnosticism represent distinct positions with different assumptions and implications.

**Ethical and existential depth**: Non-religious worldviews engage profoundly with questions of meaning, value, mortality, and purpose. The curriculum should explore how humanists and others construct meaningful lives without reference to the transcendent.

**Historical and cultural context**: Non-religious worldviews have their own histories, texts, and cultural expressions—from classical philosophy through the Enlightenment to contemporary secular movements.

### Assessment and Progression

The worldviews approach implies new approaches to assessment that move beyond recall of factual information:

**Understanding complexity**: Assessment should probe pupils' ability to understand the complexity and internal diversity of worldviews, not just rehearse simplified summaries.

**Interpretive skill**: Can pupils interpret religious and non-religious texts, practices, and artefacts in ways that show understanding of
