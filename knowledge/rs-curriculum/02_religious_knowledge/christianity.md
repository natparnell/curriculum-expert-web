# Christianity: Beliefs, Practices, and Diversity

## Introduction

Christianity is the largest religion in the world, with approximately 2.3 billion adherents globally. In Britain, Christianity has held a predominant place in religious life for over 1,500 years, shaping the nation's culture, laws, values, and institutions. The 1988 Education Reform Act requires that Religious Education (RE) in England must reflect that "the religious traditions in Great Britain are mainly Christian, while also taking into account the teachings and practices of the other principal religions represented in Great Britain."

This knowledge base entry provides RE teachers with a comprehensive understanding of Christian beliefs, practices, and denominational diversity. It is designed to support curriculum planning across the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), Key Stage 1, Key Stage 2, Key Stage 3, and Key Stage 4/GCSE, with particular attention to pedagogical approaches that enable pupils to develop a nuanced understanding of this complex faith tradition.

## Core Christian Beliefs

### The Nature of God: Monotheism with Distinctive Features

At the heart of Christianity lies belief in one God who is understood to be:

- **Omnipotent** – all-powerful
- **Omniscient** – all-knowing
- **Omnipresent** – present everywhere
- **Eternal** – existing outside of time
- **Benevolent** – all-loving and good
- **Creator** – the source of all that exists

This belief in one God distinguishes Christianity from polytheistic religions. However, Christianity's distinctive and perhaps most challenging doctrine is the **Trinity**, which affirms that this one God exists as three co-equal, co-eternal persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit.

### The Trinity

The doctrine of the Trinity is central to orthodox Christianity and represents one of the most sophisticated attempts in religious thought to hold together God's unity and God's complexity. While the word "Trinity" does not appear in the Bible, Christian theologians developed this doctrine through centuries of reflection on scriptural texts and worship practice.

**Key Trinitarian affirmations:**
- There is only one God
- The Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God
- The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct persons
- The three persons are co-equal and co-eternal

The doctrine was formalised at the Councils of Nicaea (325 CE) and Constantinople (381 CE). The **Nicene Creed**, developed at these councils, remains a foundational statement of Christian faith across most denominations.

**Pedagogical note:** The Trinity is often misunderstood by pupils as teaching that Christians worship three gods. Effective RE teaching helps pupils understand that Christians affirm both God's oneness and the three-person nature of God. Visual aids such as the shamrock (three leaves, one plant) or water (ice, liquid, steam – same substance, different forms) can be helpful, though teachers should note these are imperfect analogies.

### The Incarnation

The doctrine of the Incarnation (from Latin *in carne*, "in flesh") teaches that God the Son became human in the person of Jesus Christ. Christians believe Jesus was fully divine and fully human, united in one person "without confusion, without change, without division, without separation" (Council of Chalcedon, 451 CE).

**Key aspects of Incarnation:**
- Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary
- Jesus lived a fully human life, experiencing growth, learning, temptation, and suffering
- Jesus was without sin, yet faced the same temptations as other humans
- Jesus reveals what God is like and what humanity is meant to be

The Incarnation is celebrated at Christmas, though the theological significance extends beyond the nativity story to encompass the entirety of Jesus's life, death, and resurrection.

### The Life and Ministry of Jesus

Christians believe Jesus of Nazareth (c. 4 BCE – c. 30/33 CE) was:
- Born in Bethlehem and raised in Nazareth
- A Jewish teacher and prophet
- A worker of miracles and healer
- The Messiah (Greek: Christ) promised to Israel
- The Saviour of all humanity

The Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) record Jesus's teaching, including:
- The Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7)
- Parables about the Kingdom of God
- Ethical teachings on love, forgiveness, and justice
- Predictions of his own death and resurrection

### The Resurrection

The Resurrection of Jesus is the foundational event of Christian faith. Christians believe that three days after Jesus was crucified by Roman authorities, God raised him from the dead. The apostle Paul wrote that if Christ has not been raised, Christian faith is futile (1 Corinthians 15:17).

**Theological significance of the Resurrection:**
- Vindication of Jesus's claims and ministry
- Defeat of sin and death
- Promise of resurrection and eternal life for believers
- Foundation for Christian hope

The Resurrection is celebrated at Easter, the most important Christian festival. Different denominations emphasise different aspects: Orthodox Christians particularly celebrate Christ's victory over death; Catholic Christians focus on the Resurrection as the completion of Christ's saving work; Protestant Christians often emphasise the Resurrection as confirmation of justification by faith.

### Salvation

Christianity teaches that humanity is in need of salvation due to sin – the breaking of relationship with God and the consequent disruption of human flourishing. While all Christians affirm that salvation comes through Jesus Christ, different denominations emphasise different aspects:

**Catholic understanding:** Salvation involves both God's grace and human cooperation. The sacraments are means of grace that convey God's saving power. Good works, flowing from faith, contribute to the process of justification and sanctification.

**Protestant understanding (classic Reformation view):** Salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone. Good works are evidence of genuine faith but do not contribute to salvation. Justification is a forensic declaration of righteousness based on Christ's work.

**Orthodox understanding:** Salvation is understood primarily as *theosis* (deification) – becoming like God and sharing in the divine life. This is achieved through participation in the life of the Church, especially through the sacraments and ascetic practices.

## Christian Practices

### Prayer

Prayer is central to Christian life. Christians pray individually and communally, formally and informally. Common forms include:

**The Lord's Prayer (Our Father):** Taught by Jesus to his disciples (Matthew 6:9-13, Luke 11:2-4), this remains the most universally used Christian prayer.

**Prayer of Thanksgiving:** Expressing gratitude to God for blessings received.

**Intercession:** Praying on behalf of others.

**Confession:** Acknowledging sin and seeking forgiveness.

**Adoration:** Praising God for who God is.

**The Jesus Prayer:** Particularly important in Orthodox Christianity: "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner." This prayer is often repeated many times, sometimes using prayer ropes or beads.

**Liturgical Prayer:** Many denominations use formal prayers in worship services, including collects, litanies, and responses.

### Reading Scripture

Christians regard the Bible as sacred scripture, divided into the Old Testament (shared with Judaism) and the New Testament (Christian-specific writings). Different denominations have slightly different canons:
- **Protestant Bibles** contain 66 books
- **Catholic Bibles** contain 73 books (including deuterocanonical books)
- **Orthodox Bibles** contain additional books recognised by Eastern tradition

**Lectio Divina:** A traditional Benedictine practice of scriptural reading, meditation, and prayer intended to promote communion with God.

### Worship and Liturgy

Christian worship varies enormously across denominations but typically includes:
- Reading and preaching from Scripture
- Prayer (including the Lord's Prayer)
- Singing of hymns and spiritual songs
- The Eucharist/Holy Communion (frequency varies by denomination)
- Offering and collection
- Blessing and sending

### The Sacraments

The sacraments are sacred rituals understood to convey God's grace. Different denominations recognise different numbers of sacraments:

**Catholic and Orthodox:** Seven sacraments:
1. Baptism
2. Confirmation (Chrismation in Orthodoxy)
3. Eucharist (Holy Communion, the Mass, Divine Liturgy)
4. Penance/Reconciliation (Confession)
5. Anointing of the Sick
6. Holy Orders (Ordination)
7. Matrimony (Marriage)

**Most Protestant denominations:** Two sacraments (sometimes called ordinances):
1. Baptism
2. Holy Communion (Eucharist, Lord's Supper)

**Baptism:** The rite of initiation into the Christian Church, involving water (pouring, immersion, or sprinkling). Some denominations baptise infants; others practise believer's baptism for those old enough to profess faith.

**Eucharist/Holy Communion:** The commemoration of Christ's Last Supper with his disciples. Catholics believe in **transubstantiation** – the bread and wine become the actual body and blood of Christ. Anglicans/Protestants generally believe in the real presence of Christ in the sacrament without affirming transubstantiation. Orthodox Christians affirm the real presence and refer to the change as "metousiosis" or "trans-elementation."

### Christian Living and Ethics

Christians seek to live according to Jesus's teachings and the moral framework of the Bible. Key ethical principles include:
- Love of God and neighbour
- The Golden Rule (treat others as you wish to be treated)
- The Ten Commandments
- The Fruit of the Spirit (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control)
- Care for the poor and marginalised
- Forgiveness and reconciliation

## Denominational Diversity

### Roman Catholicism

The Roman Catholic Church is the largest Christian denomination worldwide, with over 1.3 billion members. It is led by the Pope, who Catholics believe is the successor of Saint Peter, to whom Jesus gave authority.

**Distinctive features:**
- Centralised authority under the Pope and the Magisterium (teaching office)
- Seven sacraments
- Emphasis on tradition alongside Scripture
- The Mass as the central act of worship
- Veneration of Mary (the mother of Jesus) and the saints
- Seven sacraments with particular emphasis on the Eucharist and Confession
- Celibate clergy (bishops, priests)
- Religious orders (monks, nuns, friars)

**Governance:** Hierarchical structure with Pope, cardinals, archbishops, bishops, priests, and deacons. The Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) modernised many Catholic practices while maintaining traditional doctrine.

### Eastern Orthodoxy

The Eastern Orthodox Church comprises a family of self-governing churches, including the Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Romanian Orthodox, and others, united in faith and sacramental communion.

**Distinctive features:**
- Emphasis on mystery and the apophatic tradition (knowing God through what God is not)
- Theosis (deification) as the goal of Christian life
- Veneration of icons as windows to heaven
- Divine Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom as primary worship
- Seven sacraments (called Holy Mysteries)
- Collegial governance through councils of bishops
- The Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople holds a position of honour but not universal jurisdiction

**The Great Schism (1054):** The division between Eastern and Western Christianity, resulting from theological, political, and cultural differences.

**Icons and Iconography:** Orthodox churches are filled with icons – religious paintings of Jesus, Mary, and the saints. These are not worshipped but venerated as aids to prayer. The theology of icons was developed particularly by Saint John of Damascus and affirmed at the Seventh Ecumenical Council (787 CE).

### Protestantism

Protestantism emerged from the Reformation in the 16th century, beginning with Martin Luther in Germany (1517) and John Calvin in Switzerland. Protestants "protested" certain Catholic practices and doctrines.

**Core Reformation principles (solas):**
- *Sola Scriptura* – Scripture alone as the supreme authority
- *Sola Fide* – faith alone as the means of justification
- *Sola Gratia* – grace alone as the source of salvation
- *Solus Christus* – Christ alone as the Saviour
- *Soli Deo Gloria* – glory to God alone

**Major Protestant traditions:**

**Anglicanism (Church of England):** Described as having a "via media" (middle way) between Catholicism and Protestantism. Retains bishops and liturgical worship while affirming Reformation theology. The Archbishop of Canterbury is the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion.

**Lutheranism:** Follows the teachings of Martin Luther. Emphasises justification by faith and the authority of Scripture. Strong liturgical tradition.

**Reformed/Presbyterian:** Follows John Calvin's theology. Emphasises God's sovereignty, predestination, and covenant theology. Governed by councils of elders (presbyters).

**Baptist:** Emphasises believer's baptism (not infant baptism), congregational governance, and the autonomy of the local church.

**Methodism:** Founded by John Wesley in the 18th century. Emphasises personal holiness, social justice, and the possibility of entire sanctification.

**Pentecostalism:** Emphasises the gifts of the Holy Spirit (charismata), including speaking in tongues, prophecy, and healing. Rapidly growing worldwide movement.

## Christianity in British Culture

### Historical Significance

Christianity arrived in Britain during the Roman period (traditionally with Saint Alban, Britain's first martyr, c. 250 CE). The faith became firmly established through:
- The mission of Saint Augustine to England (597 CE)
- Celtic Christianity from Ireland and Scotland
- The Synod of Whitby (664 CE), which united English Christianity under Roman practice
- Medieval cathedral building and monastic scholarship
- The English Reformation (16th century), establishing the Church of England
- The Puritan and Evangelical movements (17th-18th centuries)
- The missionary movement (18th-19th centuries)
- Modern secularisation and religious pluralism (20th-21st centuries)

### Christianity and the State

The United Kingdom has a complex relationship between church and state:
- England has an established church (Church of England), with the monarch as Supreme Governor
- The Church of Scotland is the national church in Scotland but not established in the same way
- Wales and Northern Ireland have no established church
- Bishops of the Church of England sit in the House of Lords
- The monarch is crowned in a Christian ceremony by the Archbishop of Canterbury
- Church schools (both Church of England and Catholic) play a significant role in education

### Christianity in Contemporary Britain

According to the 2021 Census, 46.2% of the population of England and Wales identified as Christian, down from 59.3% in 2011. This decline reflects broader secularisation trends across Western Europe.

Despite numerical decline, Christianity continues to shape British culture:
- Christian festivals (Christmas, Easter) remain public holidays
- Christian hymns and carols are widely known
- Church buildings are prominent in the landscape
- Christian charities and voluntary organisations serve communities
- Christian perspectives contribute to public debate on ethics and values

**Major Christian denominations in Britain:**
- Church of England (Anglican) – largest denomination
- Roman Catholic Church – significant presence, especially in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and among immigrant communities
- Church of Scotland (Presbyterian) – national church of Scotland
- Methodist Church
- Baptist Union
- United Reformed Church
- Pentecostal and charismatic churches (growing, especially among Black and minority ethnic communities)
- Eastern Orthodox churches (growing due to immigration)
- Independent evangelical churches

## Conclusion

Christianity remains a complex, diverse, and globally significant religious tradition. For RE teachers, a robust understanding of Christian beliefs, practices, and denominational diversity is essential for delivering high-quality religious education that meets statutory requirements and prepares pupils for life in a religiously diverse society.

The pedagogical challenge is to present Christianity in ways that are:
- **Accurate:** Faithful to Christian self-understanding
- **Nuanced:** Acknowledging diversity within the tradition
- **Engaging:** Capturing pupils' interest and promoting understanding
- **Progressive:** Building knowledge systematically across key stages
- **Respectful:** Treating Christian faith with the seriousness believers themselves give it

By combining subject knowledge with effective pedagogy, RE teachers can help pupils develop informed understanding of Christianity, contributing to their religious literacy and preparation for citizenship in modern Britain.
