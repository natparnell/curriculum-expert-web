# Integrating Geography Without Subsumption: Maintaining Subject Integrity in Cross-Curricular Topic Work

## Introduction: The Challenge of Curriculum Integration

The integration of geography with other subjects in the primary and secondary curriculum presents both opportunities and significant risks. While meaningful connections between disciplines can deepen pupils' understanding and make learning more coherent, geography faces a particular vulnerability: the tendency to be subsumed by history, particularly in topic-based and thematic approaches. This phenomenon, where geographical content, concepts, and disciplinary methods become absorbed within historical narratives or frameworks, represents a substantial threat to the integrity of geographical education in English schools.

This knowledge base entry examines the mechanisms by which geography loses its disciplinary identity in cross-curricular contexts, explores the consequences for pupil learning, and provides practical frameworks for maintaining geographical integrity while still achieving meaningful curriculum integration. Drawing on curriculum theory, inspection evidence, and practitioner expertise, it offers actionable strategies for curriculum leaders and geography subject specialists.

## The Subsumption Problem: Understanding the Risk

### Historical Dominance in Topic Work

Topic work has been a feature of English primary education since the 1960s and 1970s, often structured around humanities themes that combine history and geography. Historical narratives—wars, empires, political changes, famous individuals—provide engaging storylines that readily capture pupils' interest and offer clear chronological structures. The result, observed repeatedly in school inspections and research studies, is that geography becomes the "handmaiden" to history: providing the backdrop, setting, or illustrative material for historical study rather than being studied as a discipline in its own right.

Catling and Martin (2011) identified this pattern in their analysis of primary geography, noting that when topics such as "The Victorians" or "Ancient Egypt" are taught, geographical content—if present at all—typically serves to illuminate historical conditions. Pupils might learn that Victorian cities were crowded and polluted, or that the Nile River enabled Egyptian civilisation, but they do not engage with geographical questions about urban change, river systems, or human-environment interactions as geographical enquiries. The spatial, environmental, and place-based dimensions that constitute geographical thinking are marginalised or absent.

### How Subsumption Occurs

The mechanisms of geographical subsumption operate at multiple levels of curriculum design and classroom practice:

**Conceptual Subsumption**: Historical concepts—chronology, causation, change and continuity—come to dominate the analytical framework. When pupils examine a historical period, they may consider geographical features only insofar as they explain or contextualise historical events. The geographical concepts of place, space, scale, environment, and interconnection remain implicit and unexamined.

**Procedural Subsumption**: The methods of historical enquiry shape the investigative approach. Source analysis emphasises historical documents, artefacts, and testimony. Where geographical sources—maps, photographs, field data, GIS outputs—are used, they serve historical questions rather than geographical ones. Pupils do not practise geographical fieldwork, mapwork, or data analysis as disciplinary skills.

**Presentational Subsumption**: The historical narrative provides the organising structure for pupil work and display. Timelines, storyboards, and chronological accounts predominate. Spatial representations, maps, and geographical visualisations—if present—are decorative rather than analytical, illustrating historical content rather than advancing geographical understanding.

**Assessment Subsumption**: Success criteria and assessment focus on historical knowledge and skills. Where geography features in assessment, it is typically evaluated as contextual knowledge supporting historical understanding, not as geographical learning in its own right. Pupils learn implicitly that geography matters less than history.

## The Consequences of Subsumption

### For Pupils' Geographical Understanding

When geography is subsumed by history, pupils develop a distorted conception of the subject and its value. They come to see geography as descriptive background information rather than as an analytical discipline with distinctive questions, methods, and forms of knowledge. Research by Ofsted (2011, 2023) has consistently identified this as a weakness in schools where humanities are taught through topic work: pupils have limited understanding of what geography is, cannot articulate geographical questions, and do not recognise the subject as distinct from history.

The absence of sustained geographical enquiry means pupils miss the opportunity to develop spatial thinking—the ability to understand and analyse the spatial organisation of people, places, and environments on Earth's surface. This capability, increasingly recognised as essential for navigating contemporary challenges from climate change to urban planning, requires deliberate cultivation through geographical study, not incidental exposure through historical topics.

### For Curriculum Coherence

Subsumption undermines the very coherence that cross-curricular integration aims to achieve. A coherent curriculum is one in which pupils understand the relationship between different forms of knowledge and can draw appropriately on multiple disciplines to address complex questions. This requires each discipline to be sufficiently established in pupils' understanding that they can recognise its distinctive contribution.

When geography is absorbed within history, pupils cannot make informed decisions about when geographical thinking is relevant. They lack the conceptual vocabulary and methodological experience to apply geographical perspectives to new situations. The curriculum becomes less coherent, not more, because one disciplinary lens has been lost.

### For Educational Equity

Geography's subsumption has equity implications. Pupils in schools with strong topic-based humanities programmes, often in more affluent areas with experienced staff, may still receive substantial geographical education through explicit teaching and fieldwork. Pupils in schools where geography is genuinely marginalised—frequently in challenging circumstances where curriculum time is pressured—receive only the diluted, incidental geography that emerges through historical study. This contributes to the pattern noted by Ofsted (2023) where geographical education varies dramatically in quality and quantity across the school system.

## Defining Geographical Integrity

### The Disciplinary Core

Maintaining geographical integrity in cross-curricular work requires clarity about what constitutes the essential character of geographical education. The Geography National Curriculum (2013) and the Geographical Association's curriculum guidance identify several non-negotiable elements:

**Substantive Knowledge**: This includes locational knowledge (the position of places and features), place knowledge (the human and physical characteristics of specific places), and human and physical geographical knowledge (processes, patterns, and interactions). In integrated topics, this knowledge must be taught explicitly and assessed directly, not assumed as background.

**Disciplinary Knowledge**: Geography has distinctive ways of thinking and working. These include using geographical vocabulary and concepts; understanding how geographical knowledge is created through fieldwork, mapping, and data analysis; and recognising how geographical perspectives differ from other disciplinary approaches. Pupils need to understand that geographers ask particular kinds of questions: Where is this? Why is it there? How is this place connected to others? How is it changing?

**Geographical Skills**: These include map skills (using and interpreting maps at various scales), fieldwork skills (collecting and analysing geographical data), and graphical skills (creating and interpreting geographical visualisations). These skills require dedicated teaching time and practice opportunities that cannot be absorbed into historical enquiry.

### The Role of Enquiry

Geographical enquiry provides a framework for maintaining integrity. The enquiry cycle—asking geographical questions, collecting evidence, analysing and interpreting, drawing conclusions, communicating findings—structures learning around geographical processes rather than historical narratives. Even when studying a topic that includes both historical and geographical dimensions, maintaining a distinct geographical enquiry ensures the subject retains its identity.

For example, a topic on "Rivers Through Time" could be taught historically, tracing changing human uses of rivers from ancient civilisations to industrial development. Alternatively, it could maintain geographical integrity by centring geographical enquiry: How do river systems work? How do physical processes create characteristic river landforms? How do human activities interact with river processes? How do these interactions vary in different places and at different scales? The historical dimensions then serve geographical understanding rather than absorbing it.

## Strategies for Integration Without Subsumption

### 1. Disciplinary Structuring of Topic Work

The most effective approach to maintaining geographical integrity is to structure topic work around explicit disciplinary contributions. Rather than beginning with a theme or narrative, curriculum designers identify what each subject brings to the topic and ensure equal weighting in curriculum time, assessment, and presentation.

Davidson (2022) proposes a "disciplinary partnership" model where topics are designed as conversations between subjects. Each discipline maintains its own questions, methods, and assessment criteria. Integration occurs at the level of pupil reflection: pupils are explicitly taught to identify when they are thinking geographically, when historically, and how the two perspectives illuminate different aspects of the topic.

In practice, this means:
- Separate learning objectives for geography and history in every topic
- Distinct assessment criteria and success criteria for each subject
- Balanced curriculum time allocation, monitored and adjusted
- Separate exercise books or assessment portfolios for each subject
- Explicit teaching of the relationship between disciplinary perspectives

### 2. The "Golden Thread" Approach

An alternative model focuses on identifying a "golden thread" that genuinely unites disciplines without subsuming one to another. This requires identifying concepts or questions that are authentically shared across geography and history—concepts such as change, causation, or significance—while maintaining distinct disciplinary treatments.

For example, both geographers and historians are interested in change, but they approach it differently. Historians examine change over time, emphasising chronology, sequence, and the particular circumstances of periods and events. Geographers examine spatial change, emphasising patterns, distributions, and the processes that create and transform spaces. A topic on "Changing Urban Spaces" can maintain both perspectives: historical study of how a particular city developed over time, and geographical study of urban morphology, land use patterns, and spatial processes.

The key is making these differences explicit to pupils. They should understand that they are applying different disciplinary lenses to related phenomena, not learning an undifferentiated amalgam called "humanities."

### 3. Spatial Structuring as Counterbalance

Given history's tendency to dominate through chronological structuring, geography curriculum designers can deliberately employ spatial structuring as a counterbalance. Organising topics around places, regions, or spatial scales rather than historical periods ensures geographical perspectives cannot be marginalised.

For example, rather than a topic on "The Industrial Revolution" (historically structured), a topic on "The Changing Geography of Industry" (spatially structured) maintains geographical integrity. Historical content—how industrialisation occurred, when key developments happened—becomes context for understanding spatial patterns: the distribution of industry, locational factors, patterns of urbanisation, and industrial change in specific places.

### 4. Fieldwork as a Non-Negotiable Element

Fieldwork represents geography's distinctive methodological contribution and cannot be absorbed into historical study. Schools committed to maintaining geographical integrity ensure that fieldwork features in every key stage, not as an optional enrichment activity but as essential disciplinary practice.

In cross-curricular topics, fieldwork provides an opportunity to demonstrate geographical enquiry in action. Pupils collect geographical data, analyse spatial patterns, and draw geographical conclusions. This practical work reinforces the distinctiveness of geographical methods and provides concrete experiences that pupils can reference when reflecting on what geography involves.

The Geography National Curriculum requires fieldwork at Key Stages 1, 2, and 3. Schools where geography is subsumed by history frequently struggle to meet these requirements, treating fieldwork as an occasional visit rather than integrated enquiry. Maintaining fieldwork as a non-negotiable element protects geographical integrity.

### 5. Assessment Design

Assessment powerfully shapes what is taught and valued. Where assessment focuses on historical knowledge and skills, geography will be marginalised regardless of curriculum intentions. Maintaining geographical integrity requires assessment that explicitly values geographical learning.

Effective approaches include:
- Separate end-of-topic assessments for geography and history
- Assessment criteria that reward geographical thinking (spatial reasoning, application of geographical concepts, use of geographical evidence)
- Questions that require pupils to think geographically about topic content
- Assessment of geographical skills (mapwork, data analysis, fieldwork) as distinct components
- Reporting to parents that separately identifies geographical achievement

### 6. Subject Leadership and Expertise

Geography's vulnerability to subsumption is exacerbated when there is no specialist expertise to advocate for the subject. In primary schools, where generalist teachers typically deliver the curriculum, humanities coordination often falls to staff with history backgrounds or interests. Without deliberate counterbalancing, geographical perspectives are underrepresented in curriculum decisions.

Effective schools ensure dedicated geography leadership with appropriate expertise and authority. This may involve:
- Named geography subject leaders with protected time and training
- Access to geographical association membership and resources
- Network membership (local authority or trust geography networks)
- CPD specifically focused on disciplinary knowledge and pedagogical approaches
- Regular curriculum review with explicit attention to geography's presence and integrity

## Managing Specific Integration Contexts

### The Romans, Egyptians, and Vikings: Ancient Civilisations Topics

Topics on ancient civilisations present particular risks for geographical subsumption. The historical narrative—the rise and fall of empires, the lives of key figures, major events and battles—naturally dominates. Geography risks becoming limited to "where was it?" locational questions and descriptions of physical settings.

To maintain integrity, ancient civilisation topics should include explicit geographical enquiries:
- Why did these civilisations emerge in these specific locations? (Geographical factors in site and situation)
- How did physical geography influence economic activities and trade? (Human-environment interaction)
- How did these civilisations transform their environments? (Environmental change)
- How were different parts of these empires connected? (Spatial interaction and connectivity)
- How did geographical factors influence expansion and decline? (Geographical causation)

These enquiries should include geographical sources and methods: analysing relief maps of river valleys, examining climate data, using archaeological site distribution maps, comparing settlement patterns. Pupils should produce geographical outputs: annotated maps, spatial analyses, geographical explanations—not just historical accounts with incidental geographical references.

### Local Studies

Local area studies provide ideal contexts for maintaining geographical integrity while allowing historical dimensions. The local environment—physical and human geography of the school locality—should be studied geographically through fieldwork, mapping, and spatial analysis.

Historical dimensions of the local area complement this without dominating. Pupils might examine how the locality has changed over time, but this historical study should serve and extend geographical understanding of the place, not absorb it. The geographical question—"What is this place like and why?"—remains primary.

### Environmental and Sustainability Topics

Topics addressing environmental issues and sustainability appear to naturally support geographical integrity, given geography's concern with human-environment interactions. However, these topics can become generic "topic work" without disciplinary rigour, or can be absorbed into science education if not carefully structured.

Maintaining geographical integrity requires:
- Explicit use of geographical concepts (place, scale, interconnection) in analysing environmental issues
- Attention to spatial variation and distribution (environmental issues affect different places differently)
- Analysis of geographical processes underlying environmental phenomena
- Consideration of geographical perspectives on solutions (spatial planning, resource management, locational decisions)

### Global Studies and "The Wider World"

Topics focusing on global regions or international development risk presenting geography as descriptive, encyclopaedic knowledge—what the GA calls "geography as gazetteer." When combined with historical study of colonialism or global trade, geography can become subsumed within historical narratives of exploration, empire, and globalisation.

Integrity-maintaining approaches:
- Study places through geographical enquiry, not just as illustrations of historical processes
- Examine contemporary geographical issues in their own right, not only as legacies of historical processes
- Use geographical frameworks (development indicators, globalisation indices, demographic transition) as analytical tools
- Ensure balanced representation: places studied for their geographical interest, not only as former colonies or trading partners

## Curriculum Leadership: Systemic Approaches

### Auditing for Geographical Presence

School and trust leaders concerned about geographical integrity should conduct regular audits of curriculum provision. This goes beyond checking that geography appears on timetables to examining:
- Curriculum time allocation: Is geography receiving equitable time compared to history?
- Learning objectives: Are geographical objectives explicit, challenging, and assessed?
- Pupil work scrutiny: Does pupils' work demonstrate geographical thinking, or only historical?
- Assessment data: Is geographical achievement tracked and reported separately?
- Pupil voice: Can pupils articulate what geography is and what they have learned?
- Resources: Are geographical resources (maps, atlases, data sources) current and used?

### Trust-Wide Approaches

Multi-academy trusts have particular opportunities and responsibilities for maintaining geographical integrity across their schools. Trust-wide curriculum frameworks should:
- Explicitly specify geographical content and skills at each stage
- Provide geographical assessment criteria and exemplification
- Ensure access to geographical expertise (subject specialists, GA membership)
- Monitor geographical provision through quality assurance processes
- Support geography-specific CPD and network development

Trusts that specify topics without specifying disciplinary learning objectives create conditions where geography can be marginalised. Those that provide detailed geographical guidance, resources, and assessment frameworks protect subject integrity.

### Ofsted and Accountability

The Ofsted inspection framework (2023) places increased emphasis on curriculum breadth and integrity. Inspectors evaluate whether schools provide a "broad and balanced" curriculum and assess the quality of education in individual subjects. Schools where geography has been subsumed by history are vulnerable to inspection findings of curriculum narrowing or weak subject provision.

Key inspection indicators relevant to geographical integrity include:
- Curriculum intent: Is geography clearly identified with specific aims and content?
- Implementation: Is geographical content actually taught and not just planned?
- Impact: Can pupils demonstrate geographical knowledge, skills, and understanding?

Schools can prepare for and demonstrate geographical integrity through documentation that explicitly addresses these areas and through pupil work that evidences geographical learning.

## Professional Development Implications

### Developing Teachers' Disciplinary Knowledge

Primary teachers, in particular, may lack confidence in geographical disciplinary knowledge. Many primary educators received limited geography education in their own schooling and training, and may not have studied geography beyond age 14. This knowledge gap contributes to geography's subsumption: teachers feel more confident teaching history and naturally emphasise the disciplinary area they understand better.

Effective CPD addresses this directly:
- Developing teachers' own geographical knowledge and understanding
- Clarifying what geographical thinking involves and how it differs from historical thinking
- Providing practical examples of geographical enquiry in primary contexts
- Building confidence in geographical fieldwork and mapwork
- Creating networks where teachers can share geographical expertise and resources

### The Role of Subject Associations

The Geographical Association (GA) provides essential support for maintaining geographical integrity. Membership offers access to:
- Curriculum resources designed to maintain disciplinary rigour
- Professional development focused on disciplinary knowledge and pedagogical approaches
- Primary Geography journal with practitioner examples and research
- Network opportunities including local
