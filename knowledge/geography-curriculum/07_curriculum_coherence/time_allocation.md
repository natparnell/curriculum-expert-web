# Time Allocation and Curriculum Planning for Geography

## Overview

Time allocation represents one of the most critical yet frequently contested aspects of geography curriculum planning in English schools. Unlike core subjects such as English and mathematics, geography operates without statutory minimum time requirements, creating significant variation in provision across schools. This document examines the evidence base for geography time allocation, explores different timetabling models, analyses the impact of time constraints on curriculum quality, and offers practical frameworks for curriculum leaders seeking to optimise their geography provision.

## National Context and Policy Framework

### Statutory Requirements

The National Curriculum for Geography applies to Key Stages 1-3 (ages 5-14) in maintained schools and academies in England. However, unlike the core subjects, the geography programme of study contains no prescribed minimum time allocation. This absence of statutory guidance creates both opportunity and risk: schools enjoy flexibility to design provision according to local circumstances, yet geography frequently experiences marginalisation in favour of subjects with greater accountability weighting.

At Key Stage 4, geography becomes optional, competing with history and other humanities subjects for student uptake. The time allocated to GCSE Geography varies considerably depending on whether schools adopt three-year or two-year Key Stage 4 programmes, with the former increasingly common following curriculum reforms in 2014-2016.

### Ofsted Expectations

The Ofsted Education Inspection Framework (2021) emphasises curriculum breadth and depth without prescribing specific time allocations. Inspectors evaluate whether schools provide "a broad and ambitious curriculum for all pupils" and assess curriculum implementation against the intended learning. Geography leaders should note that Ofsted's subject reports have consistently identified time pressures as a limiting factor in curriculum quality.

The 2023 Ofsted subject report on geography noted that schools with strong practice typically ensured sufficient curriculum time for pupils to develop both substantive and disciplinary knowledge. Conversely, weaker provision often correlated with compressed curriculum time, leading to superficial coverage and limited opportunities for fieldwork.

## Recommended Time Allocations

### Key Stage 1 (Years 1-2)

At Key Stage 1, geography is embedded within the broader geography element of Understanding the World in the Early Years Foundation Stage and continues as a distinct subject through Years 1 and 2. The Geography Association recommends a minimum of 36-45 hours of geography teaching annually at this key stage, typically delivered through a cross-curricular topic approach.

This time allocation should enable pupils to:
- Develop locational knowledge of the United Kingdom and its surrounding seas
- Understand similarities and differences between their locality and a small area of a non-European country
- Use basic geographical vocabulary to refer to key physical features
- Begin using maps, atlases, and globes

### Key Stage 2 (Years 3-6)

For Key Stage 2, the Geography Association recommends 45-60 hours of geography teaching per year. This increase reflects the expanded programme of study, which includes more detailed locational knowledge, extended place studies, and developing competence in geographical skills.

Effective KS2 geography provision typically requires:
- Regular weekly lessons rather than blocking
- Sustained time for fieldwork investigations in the school grounds and local area
- Opportunities for extended projects that develop enquiry skills
- Integration of map skills across topics

### Key Stage 3 (Years 7-9)

Key Stage 3 represents a critical phase for geography, yet it often faces the greatest time pressures. The subject typically competes with history for limited humanities curriculum time, with school structures varying from discrete geography lessons to combined humanities programmes.

The Geography Association recommends **72-90 hours annually** for Key Stage 3 geography (approximately 5% of curriculum time). This translates to roughly:
- Two 60-minute lessons per week in a 25-period week, or
- Three 50-minute lessons per week in a 30-period week

Schools approaching or exceeding this recommendation demonstrate stronger outcomes in:
- Development of comprehensive locational knowledge
- Progression in geographical enquiry skills
- Quality and frequency of fieldwork opportunities
- Pupil uptake at GCSE

### Key Stage 4 (Years 10-11)

GCSE Geography typically receives 10-15% of curriculum time within the optional element of Key Stage 4. For a standard two-year GCSE programme, this equates to:
- Three to five hours per week in a 25-period week
- Four to six hours per week in a 30-period week

Schools operating three-year Key Stage 4 programmes (starting GCSE content in Year 9) may allocate proportionally less time in Years 10-11 but must ensure sufficient time for fieldwork requirements, particularly the independent investigation component required by most examination specifications.

## Timetabling Models

### Discrete Subject Provision

In the discrete model, geography maintains its own timetable slots throughout each key stage. This approach offers several advantages:

**Curriculum Coherence**: Discrete provision enables geography departments to design coherent learning sequences without compromise to other humanities subjects.

**Teacher Expertise**: Lessons are taught by specialists (particularly important at Key Stage 3 and 4), ensuring accurate subject knowledge and appropriate pedagogical approaches.

**Identity and Profile**: Regular scheduled slots elevate geography's status within the school curriculum and support pupil recognition of geography as a distinct discipline.

However, discrete provision can create timetabling challenges, particularly in smaller schools where specialist staffing may be limited.

### Humanities Rotation Models

Some schools adopt rotation or carousel models where pupils study geography and history (and sometimes religious education) in alternating half-terms or terms. Variations include:

**Half-Term Rotation**: Pupils study geography for half a term, then history for half a term. This model can enable focused, intensive study but creates significant gaps in learning and limits the development of sustained geographical thinking.

**Termly Rotation**: Similar to half-term rotation but with longer blocks. Still problematic for progression but allows more extended enquiry work within each block.

**Parallel Rotation**: Pupils in different year groups study different subjects simultaneously (e.g., Year 7A studies geography while 7B studies history, then they swap). This maintains specialist teaching but halves curriculum time for each subject.

Research by the Historical Association and Geography Association consistently identifies rotation models as problematic for pupil outcomes in both subjects. The 2021 Ofsted research review for geography specifically noted that curriculum time protected for geography (rather than shared through rotation) correlated with stronger outcomes.

### Spiral and Integrated Models

Some primary schools and a minority of secondary schools adopt integrated or topic-based approaches where geography content is combined with other subjects. When well-designed, this can create meaningful contexts for geographical learning. However, integration risks geography becoming subordinate to other subjects, with geographical content serving as a vehicle for literacy or science rather than being taught as a discipline in its own right.

The Geography Association advises that integrated approaches should:
- Maintain identifiable geographical learning objectives
- Ensure progression in geographical knowledge and skills
- Include dedicated time for map work and fieldwork
- Avoid geography being diluted by over-integration

## Impact of Time Allocation on Curriculum Quality

### Substantive Knowledge Development

Adequate curriculum time enables the systematic development of substantive geographical knowledge across the three core domains: locational knowledge, place knowledge, and environmental, physical, and human geography knowledge. Schools with limited time often compress content coverage, leading to:

**Superficial Place Studies**: Rather than developing deep knowledge of a smaller number of places, pupils encounter a superficial tour of multiple locations without depth of understanding.

**Fragmented Locational Knowledge**: Locational knowledge requires regular revisiting and application. Compressed curricula may introduce locations without the sustained engagement necessary for retention.

**Reduced Environmental Geography**: Topics such as climate change, sustainability, and resource management often suffer when time is constrained, despite their contemporary relevance and pupil interest.

### Disciplinary Knowledge and Enquiry

Geography's disciplinary dimension—how geographical knowledge is created, contested, and applied—requires substantial curriculum time to develop. This includes:

**Fieldwork Competence**: Meaningful fieldwork cannot be rushed. From planning and risk assessment through data collection, analysis, and presentation, geographical enquiry requires sustained engagement. Schools with limited time may reduce fieldwork to tokenistic experiences rather than developing genuine enquiry skills.

**Cartographic Skills**: Map reading, interpretation, and creation require regular practice. Time-constrained curricula often limit pupils to passive map reading rather than active map-making and critical interpretation.

**Data Handling**: Geographical data analysis—from simple tally charts in primary school to complex GIS applications at GCSE—requires time for pupils to encounter, manipulate, and interrogate data.

**Extended Writing**: Geography demands that pupils write as geographers, using appropriate terminology and conceptual frameworks. This disciplinary literacy develops through sustained engagement with geographical content, not through rushed coverage.

### Assessment and Feedback

Adequate curriculum time creates space for meaningful formative assessment and responsive teaching. When time is compressed, assessment may be limited to summative testing without the embedded formative practices that enable teachers to identify and address misconceptions.

Schools with stronger time allocation typically demonstrate:
- Regular low-stakes quizzing to support retention of locational knowledge
- Extended assessment tasks that require pupils to work as geographers
- Time for detailed feedback and pupil response to feedback
- Opportunities for Assessment for Learning strategies within lessons

## Factors Influencing Time Allocation Decisions

### Accountability Pressures

The position of geography in school accountability measures significantly influences curriculum time allocation. Until 2016, the English Baccalaureate (EBacc) included geography or history, creating some protection for humanities time. However, progress 8 measures and the continued prioritisation of English and mathematics in floor standards can lead to curriculum narrowing, particularly in schools facing intervention.

Schools with lower uptake of EBacc subjects may reduce Key Stage 3 geography time to create additional English and mathematics provision. Conversely, schools seeking to improve EBacc entry may protect or expand geography time.

### Staffing and Expertise

Geography curriculum time decisions are frequently influenced by staffing constraints:

**Primary Schools**: Many primary teachers report limited confidence in teaching geography, leading to its marginalisation in favour of subjects where teachers feel more secure. Schools with geography subject leaders or partnerships with secondary specialists typically maintain stronger provision.

**Secondary Schools**: The availability of specialist geography teachers affects timetabling possibilities. Schools with limited specialist staffing may adopt humanities teaching where non-specialists teach both geography and history, often with reduced time allocation to enable staff to prepare across two subjects.

### Physical Resources

Access to resources can influence time allocation decisions. Schools with limited outdoor space may reduce geography time because fieldwork opportunities are constrained. Conversely, schools with strong outdoor learning environments, well-equipped geography departments, and access to IT for GIS work may be more inclined to protect and expand geography provision.

### Pupil Characteristics and Context

Schools serving disadvantaged communities sometimes reduce geography time based on assumptions about pupil interests or priorities. However, research suggests that pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds benefit particularly from the cultural capital and world knowledge that geography provides. The Ofsted geography research review emphasised that all pupils deserve access to a full geography curriculum regardless of background.

## Strategies for Protecting and Expanding Geography Time

### Evidence-Based Advocacy

Geography subject leaders should build a robust evidence base to support time allocation discussions with senior leaders:

**Qualifications Data**: Track the relationship between Key Stage 3 time allocation and GCSE uptake and outcomes. Schools with stronger Key Stage 3 provision typically demonstrate higher uptake and better results at GCSE.

**Pupil Voice**: Collect and present pupil perspectives on geography, including the value they place on fieldwork and learning about the wider world.

**Ofsted Alignment**: Map geography curriculum time against Ofsted expectations and subject report findings, particularly where these identify time as a limiting factor.

**Progression Analysis**: Demonstrate how reduced time creates gaps in learning that impact later achievement, particularly where GCSE specifications assume knowledge and skills developed at Key Stage 3.

### Curriculum Efficiency

Where time cannot be expanded, subject leaders should maximise the efficiency of existing provision:

**Curriculum Review**: Critically evaluate the programme of study to ensure all content serves clear purposes and contributes to progression. Remove duplication and marginal content that does not develop core geographical knowledge or skills.

**Cross-Phase Planning**: Work with primary feeder schools (or within all-through schools) to ensure Key Stage 2 content establishes foundations without unnecessary repetition at Key Stage 3.

**Assessment Streamlining**: Review assessment practices to ensure time is spent on teaching and learning rather than excessive assessment activities.

### Alternative Provision Models

Some schools extend geographical learning beyond timetabled lessons:

**Geography Clubs**: Lunchtime or after-school clubs can provide fieldwork opportunities, geography challenges, and extension activities that supplement limited curriculum time.

**Drop-Down Days**: Some schools use collapsed timetable days for extended geographical enquiries, fieldwork, or sustainability projects. While not a substitute for regular curriculum time, these can provide valuable supplementary experiences.

**Residential Experiences**: Residential field courses, particularly at Key Stage 3 and 4, can significantly enhance geographical learning. Schools should ensure these connect explicitly to curriculum content rather than operating as isolated experiences.

## Monitoring and Evaluating Time Allocation

### Self-Evaluation Framework

Geography subject leaders should regularly audit their curriculum time allocation against recommended benchmarks:

| Key Stage | Minimum Adequate | Good Practice | Excellent Practice |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| KS1 | 36 hours/year | 45 hours/year | 54+ hours/year |
| KS2 | 45 hours/year | 60 hours/year | 72+ hours/year |
| KS3 | 54 hours/year | 72 hours/year | 90+ hours/year |
| KS4 (GCSE) | 120 hours/year | 150 hours/year | 180+ hours/year |

### Quality Indicators

Beyond simple time metrics, subject leaders should evaluate:

**Time Purity**: How much of allocated geography time is actually spent on geographical learning? Some "geography" lessons may be diverted to catch-up interventions, administrative tasks, or coverage of other curriculum areas.

**Time Distribution**: Is time distributed appropriately across the year? Intensive blocking followed by long gaps creates retention problems. Regular, distributed geography sessions support better learning.

**Time Use**: How effectively is allocated time used? Lesson observations and work scrutiny should evaluate whether time is spent on high-value geographical activities rather than low-demand tasks.

### External Benchmarking

Schools should compare their geography time allocation against:

- Similar schools in their trust or local authority
- Schools with strong geography outcomes (Ofsted case studies, Geography Association Quality Mark holders)
- Published curriculum models from high-performing jurisdictions

## Case Studies in Time Allocation

### Case Study 1: Expanding Key Stage 3 Provision

A medium-sized secondary school in the Midlands operated a two-year Key Stage 3 with one hour of geography per week (approximately 72 hours over two years). GCSE uptake was low (18%), and Ofsted identified limited curriculum breadth as an area for improvement.

The school redesigned its curriculum to a three-year Key Stage 3 with two hours of geography per week (approximately 180 hours). This expanded time enabled:
- Comprehensive coverage of the National Curriculum
- Regular fieldwork opportunities in the local area
- Extended place studies with genuine depth
- Stronger pupil engagement and understanding

GCSE uptake increased to 43% within three years, with outcomes improving from below to significantly above national averages.

### Case Study 2: Protecting Time in a Primary Setting

A primary school serving a disadvantaged community had reduced geography to a single half-term per year, taught through a cross-curricular topic approach with weak geographical focus. Pupils demonstrated limited locational knowledge and poor map skills on entry to Key Stage 3.

The school appointed a geography subject leader who:
- Mapped geography content across the curriculum to ensure regular, distributed provision
- Established weekly "geography focus" sessions in addition to topic work
- Prioritised fieldwork in the school grounds and local area
- Trained staff in geographical pedagogy

Pupils now experience geography throughout the year, with significant improvements in locational knowledge, enquiry skills, and engagement.

### Case Study 3: Curriculum Recovery Post-Pandemic

A secondary school that had reduced Key Stage 3 geography to 45 minutes per week during pandemic recovery sought to rebuild its provision. The geography subject leader developed a phased approach:

**Year 1**: Restored time to 90 minutes per week; focused on disciplinary knowledge and fieldwork to rebuild engagement
**Year 2**: Expanded to two hours per week; developed comprehensive curriculum resources to maximise efficiency of expanded time
**Year 3**: Evaluated impact on GCSE uptake and outcomes; secured permanent two-hour allocation based on evidence of improved results

## Conclusion

Time allocation fundamentally shapes the quality and impact of geography education. While schools operate within genuine constraints, the evidence consistently demonstrates that adequate curriculum time correlates with stronger pupil outcomes, higher engagement, and better progression to further study.

Geography subject leaders must advocate effectively for appropriate time allocation, drawing on research evidence, Ofsted expectations, and data from their own contexts. Where time cannot be expanded, leaders should maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of existing provision while continuing to build the case for geography as a curriculum priority.

The Geography Association's benchmarks—36-45 hours at Key Stage 1, 45-60 hours at Key Stage 2, and 72-90 hours at Key Stage 3—represent minimum standards for adequate provision. Schools falling below these thresholds should consider the impact on pupil entitlement and take steps to address curriculum narrowing.

Ultimately, geography's contribution to pupils' understanding of the world, development of critical thinking skills, and preparation for responsible citizenship justifies appropriate curriculum time. Schools that protect and prioritise geography provision demonstrate a genuine commitment to a broad and balanced curriculum for all pupils.
