# EYFS to KS1 Transition in Geography: Building on Early Geographical Encounters

## Introduction

The transition from Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) to Key Stage 1 represents a critical juncture in children's geographical education. During the EYFS, children encounter geography implicitly through the "Understanding the World" area of learning, developing foundational concepts about places, environments, and their immediate surroundings. The challenge for primary educators is ensuring that KS1 geography builds upon these early experiences without unnecessary repetition, creating coherent progression that respects children's prior learning whilst introducing new disciplinary knowledge.

This knowledge file explores the theoretical and practical dimensions of EYFS-KS1 transition in geography, examining how early geographical encounters can be harnessed to create meaningful progression in the national curriculum. It addresses common pitfalls in transition planning, offers frameworks for curriculum coherence, and provides practical strategies for classroom implementation.

## Understanding EYFS Geography: The Foundation

### The Statutory Framework for EYFS

Geography in the EYFS is embedded within "Understanding the World," one of the seven areas of learning and development. The educational programme states that children must have opportunities to "explore, observe and find out about people, places, technology and the environment." This framing positions geography as fundamentally about exploration and discovery rather than formal subject knowledge.

The Early Learning Goals (ELGs) that most directly relate to geography include:

**People, Culture and Communities:** Children should know some similarities and differences between different religious and cultural communities in this country, drawing on their experiences and what has been read in class. They should explain some similarities and differences between life in this country and life in other countries.

**The Natural World:** Children should explore the natural world around them, making observations and drawing pictures of animals and plants. They should know some similarities and differences between the natural world around them and contrasting environments, drawing on their experiences and what has been read in class. They should understand some important processes and changes in the natural world around them, including the seasons and changing states of matter.

These goals reveal the EYFS approach to geography: experiential, observational, and centred on children's immediate experiences. The emphasis on "similarities and differences" foreshadows the comparative thinking that becomes more formalised in KS1, whilst the focus on the "natural world" establishes early foundations for physical geography.

### Characteristics of Effective Teaching and Learning in EYFS Geography

The EYFS statutory framework identifies three characteristics of effective teaching and learning that profoundly shape early geographical encounters:

**Playing and Exploring:** Children investigate and experience things, and "have a go." In geographical terms, this manifests as outdoor exploration, messy play with natural materials, and sensory engagement with environments. Children learn about weather by experiencing it, about places by visiting them, and about materials by handling them.

**Active Learning:** Children concentrate and keep on trying if they encounter difficulties, and enjoy achievements. Geographical learning in EYFS often involves sustained investigation—returning to the same outdoor space across seasons, observing changes over time, and persisting with practical challenges like constructing with natural materials.

**Creating and Thinking Critically:** Children have and develop their own ideas, make links between ideas, and develop strategies for doing things. Early geographical thinking might involve children suggesting explanations for why puddles disappear, making predictions about weather, or connecting their own experiences to stories about distant places.

These characteristics reveal that EYFS geography is fundamentally about developing dispositions and processes rather than acquiring specific geographical knowledge. The transition to KS1 must therefore build upon these learning characteristics whilst introducing more structured geographical enquiry.

## The KS1 National Curriculum: New Demands

### Statutory Requirements

The National Curriculum for geography at KS1 introduces formal subject requirements that represent a significant shift from the EYFS approach:

**Locational Knowledge:** Pupils should be taught to name and locate the world's seven continents and five oceans; name, locate and identify characteristics of the four countries and capital cities of the United Kingdom and its surrounding seas.

**Place Knowledge:** Pupils should understand geographical similarities and differences through studying the human and physical geography of a small area of the United Kingdom, and of a small area in a contrasting non-European country.

**Human and Physical Geography:** Pupils should identify seasonal and daily weather patterns in the United Kingdom and the location of hot and cold areas of the world in relation to the Equator and the North and South Poles; use basic geographical vocabulary to refer to key physical features (beach, cliff, coast, forest, hill, mountain, sea, ocean, river, soil, valley, vegetation, season, weather) and key human features (city, town, village, factory, farm, house, office, port, harbour, shop).

**Geographical Skills and Fieldwork:** Pupils should use world maps, atlases and globes to identify the United Kingdom and its countries, as well as the countries, continents and oceans studied; use simple compass directions and locational and directional language; use aerial photographs and plan perspectives to recognise landmarks and basic human and physical features; devise a simple map; and use and construct basic symbols in a key.

### The Transition Challenge

The shift from EYFS to KS1 geography involves several significant transitions:

**From Implicit to Explicit:** EYFS geography is implicit within "Understanding the World"; KS1 geography is explicitly named as a subject with defined programmes of study.

**From Experiential to Representational:** EYFS geography emphasises direct experience; KS1 introduces abstract representations including maps, globes, and atlases.

**From Local to Global:** EYFS geography focuses almost exclusively on children's immediate environment; KS1 requires engagement with national and global scales.

**From Holistic to Analytical:** EYFS geography treats the environment as an integrated whole; KS1 introduces distinct categories of "human" and "physical" geography.

**From Emergent to Specified:** EYFS follows children's interests and emerging questions; KS1 follows a specified programme of study with defined endpoints.

These transitions present both opportunities and risks. When managed well, they create exciting new possibilities for children's geographical learning. When managed poorly, they can create jarring discontinuities that leave children confused or disengaged.

## Common Pitfalls in EYFS-KS1 Transition

### Pitfall 1: The "Fresh Start" Fallacy

Some KS1 teachers approach Year 1 geography as a "fresh start," ignoring or unaware of children's EYFS experiences. This approach wastes valuable prior learning and can leave children feeling that their nursery and reception experiences don't count as "real" learning. The "fresh start" fallacy often manifests as:

- Treating map skills as entirely new learning, without acknowledging children's informal spatial reasoning developed through outdoor play
- Introducing place vocabulary without connecting to children's existing knowledge of their local area
- Presenting seasonal change as a KS1 topic without recognising that children have already observed seasons across their EYFS years

### Pitfall 2: Unconscious Repetition

Conversely, some teachers inadvertently repeat EYFS content in KS1 without adding sufficient challenge or progression. This might involve:

- Conducting identical seasonal walks in Year 1 that merely replicate reception experiences
- Studying the local area without introducing the new conceptual frameworks (human/physical distinction, comparative thinking)
- Exploring materials and weather patterns without the increased specificity and vocabulary demanded by the national curriculum

Such repetition without progression leads to disengagement and fails to capitalise on children's readiness for new learning.

### Pitfall 3: Abrupt Abstraction

The introduction of maps, globes, and atlases in KS1 can be abrupt and disconnected from children's embodied spatial understanding. When children are suddenly asked to interpret abstract representations without explicit connections to their lived experience, they may struggle to make meaning. This pitfall manifests as:

- Introducing globes and world maps without first establishing what these representations correspond to
- Teaching compass directions as abstract knowledge rather than connecting to children's spatial navigation in familiar environments
- Expecting children to interpret aerial photographs without scaffolding the perspective shift required

### Pitfall 4: Neglecting Conceptual Development

KS1 geography introduces new conceptual distinctions—human versus physical geography, countries versus continents, weather versus climate. Without explicit attention to conceptual development, these distinctions can remain superficial or confusing. Children may:

- Learn to label "human" and "physical" features without understanding what makes them distinct categories
- Memorise country names without understanding what a country is as a geographical concept
- Describe weather patterns without connecting them to the broader concept of climate

## Principles for Coherent Transition

### Principle 1: Prior Knowledge Activation

Effective transition begins with explicit activation of children's EYFS learning. This involves:

**Audit and Mapping:** Before planning Year 1 geography, teachers should audit what children have experienced in EYFS. What local walks did they undertake? What weather observations did they make? What stories about distant places were shared? This audit creates a foundation for building new learning.

**Explicit Connection:** Teachers should make connections to prior learning explicit to children. Rather than assuming children will make connections themselves, effective practitioners say: "When you were in reception, you explored the school grounds across different seasons. Today we're going to use that experience to learn about why seasons change."

**Building Vocabulary:** EYFS experiences provide rich contexts for introducing KS1 vocabulary. A child who has observed autumn leaves falling can be introduced to "deciduous" trees; a child who has walked to the local shop can learn about "settlement" patterns.

### Principle 2: Scaffolded Abstraction

The move from experiential learning to representational thinking requires careful scaffolding:

**Progressive Symbolisation:** Introduce maps through progressive levels of abstraction. Begin with photographic maps of familiar spaces, move to simple pictorial maps, then introduce conventional symbols. This mirrors the EYFS approach of starting with the familiar and concrete.

**Embodied Spatial Reasoning:** Before introducing compass directions as abstract concepts, engage children in directional language through physical movement. Games that involve "turning north" or following directional instructions in the playground build embodied understanding that supports later map work.

**Multi-Modal Representation:** Support children's understanding of abstract representations by providing multiple access points. A globe can be explored tactilely; maps can be walked on the playground; aerial photographs can be compared to ground-level views.

### Principle 3: Conceptual Depth Over Coverage

Rather than rushing to "cover" the KS1 content, effective transition focuses on developing conceptual depth:

**Human and Physical Geography:** Take time to establish what these categories mean and why they matter. Use children's EYFS experiences—building with blocks (human), observing rainfall (physical)—to illustrate the distinction. Explore borderline cases (a park with planted trees and natural ponds) to deepen understanding.

**Scale and Place:** Help children understand the nested scales of geographical enquiry. A child lives in a house, on a street, in a neighbourhood, in a town, in a country, on a continent, on Earth. Explicitly teaching this scalar nesting helps children make sense of locational knowledge requirements.

**Similarities and Differences:** Build upon the EYFS focus on comparison by introducing increasingly systematic comparative frameworks. Rather than simply noticing differences between local and distant places, teach children to compare across specific dimensions: weather, landscape, buildings, transport, food.

### Principle 4: Maintaining Enquiry and Exploration

Whilst KS1 geography is more structured, it should retain the exploratory spirit of EYFS:

**Question-Led Enquiry:** Frame KS1 geography around genuine questions that build upon children's EYFS curiosity. "Why is it hotter near the Equator?" "How do people in different places get to school?" "Why do some places have more rain than others?"

**Fieldwork Continuity:** Maintain the EYFS emphasis on outdoor learning and direct experience. The KS1 requirement for fieldwork should be seen as developing EYFS exploration, not replacing it. Children who regularly explored the outdoor environment in EYFS should continue this exploration with increased geographical focus.

**Child Voice:** Continue to value children's own geographical experiences and questions. A child who has visited family abroad brings valuable knowledge; a child's question about why the moon changes shape opens avenues for geographical and scientific learning.

## Practical Strategies for Classroom Implementation

### Strategy 1: The "Geographical Journey" Display

Create a classroom display that makes children's geographical learning journey visible. The display might show:

- Photographs from EYFS outdoor exploration, labelled with emerging geographical vocabulary
- Examples of EYFS mark-making that shows early mapping (children's drawings of routes, maps in role-play)
- Current KS1 work, explicitly connected to prior learning: "In reception you explored the school grounds. Now you're making a map of what you found."
- Future learning preview: "Next term we'll be comparing our school to a school in Kenya"

This display helps children see their learning as continuous and cumulative, supporting the narrative of progression from EYFS to KS1.

### Strategy 2: Vocabulary Bridging

Develop explicit vocabulary progression that bridges EYFS and KS1:

| EYFS Foundation Vocabulary | KS1 Development | Conceptual Shift |
|---------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Big, small, near, far | Closer, further, distance, scale | From relative to measured spatial relations |
| Hot, cold, sunny, rainy | Temperature, climate, weather patterns | From immediate sensation to systematic observation |
| Hill, river, tree | Mountain, valley, vegetation, physical features | From everyday language to geographical terminology |
| Houses, roads, shops | Settlement, transport, human features | From familiar objects to geographical categories |
| Our school, the park | Local area, environment, place | From specific locations to geographical concepts |

This bridging vocabulary should be explicitly taught, with teachers drawing attention to how KS1 terms develop EYFS concepts.

### Strategy 3: Progressive Fieldwork

Design fieldwork that shows clear progression from EYFS exploration:

**Reception:** Open exploration of the school grounds; sensory engagement with natural materials; observation of weather and seasons through regular outdoor time.

**Year 1:** Structured observation using simple recording sheets; introduction of directional language in the playground; creating simple maps of familiar routes; comparing two areas within the school grounds using human/physical categories.

**Year 2:** Systematic data collection (traffic surveys, weather recording); using simple compass directions; creating maps with keys; comparing local area with contrasting locality through fieldwork and secondary sources.

Each stage should be explicitly connected to what came before: "Last year you explored the school grounds. This year we're going to map what we find."

### Strategy 4: Story and Place Continuity

Maintain continuity in how places are encountered through stories and resources:

If EYFS children have encountered stories from a particular culture or region, KS1 geography can return to those places with increased geographical focus. For example:

- EYFS: Sharing stories from Kenya, noticing different animals and landscapes
- Year 1: More systematic study of Kenya as the "contrasting non-European country," using children's prior interest as a starting point
- Connection: "Remember the stories we read about Kenya in nursery? Today we're going to learn about what it's like to go to school there."

This approach values children's prior learning and creates coherent curricular narratives.

## Assessing Transition: What to Look For

### Indicators of Successful Transition

Children who have experienced effective EYFS-KS1 transition in geography typically demonstrate:

**Confidence with Abstraction:** They can interpret simple maps and connect them to real spaces without confusion. They understand that a globe represents the Earth, even though it looks different from their ground-level experience.

**Rich Vocabulary:** They use geographical terms with understanding, not just as labels. They can explain what they mean by "physical feature" or "settlement" and give examples.

**Systematic Comparison:** They compare places across specific dimensions rather than just listing random differences. They can explain that they're comparing weather, or transport, or buildings.

**Continued Curiosity:** They remain interested in the world around them, asking geographical questions and wanting to explore. They haven't become disengaged through repetition or confused through abrupt abstraction.

**Explicit Connection:** They can articulate connections between their EYFS and KS1 learning: "We did this in reception but now we're doing it properly with maps."

### Assessment Strategies

**Conversation and Observation:** The most powerful assessment happens through conversation with children about their geographical learning. Ask: "What did you learn about geography in reception? How is Year 1 geography different? What connects them?"

**Book and Display Review:** Review children's geography books and classroom displays for evidence of connection-making. Look for explicit links drawn between EYFS and KS1 learning.

**Transition Tracking:** Some schools find it valuable to track a cohort's geographical learning from EYFS through KS1, documenting how specific experiences in reception are built upon in Years 1 and 2.

## Whole-School Curriculum Planning

### Mapping the Journey

Effective EYFS-KS1 transition requires whole-school curriculum planning that makes progression visible:

**Vertical Mapping:** Create curriculum maps that show how geography develops from EYFS through KS1 and beyond. This should make explicit what children learn at each stage and how it prepares them for what comes next.

**Vocabulary Progression:** Develop whole-school vocabulary progression documents that show how geographical terms are introduced, developed, and consolidated across year groups.

**Fieldwork Continuity:** Plan fieldwork experiences across the school to ensure progression. The EYFS emphasis on outdoor exploration should develop into increasingly structured fieldwork in KS1, KS2, and beyond.

### Professional Development

Teachers need professional development to understand and implement effective transition:

**EYFS-KS1 Dialogue:** Create opportunities for EYFS and KS1 teachers to discuss geography curriculum and pedagogy. KS1 teachers need to understand what children experience in EYFS; EYFS teachers need to understand the demands of the KS1 curriculum.

**Subject Knowledge:** Many primary teachers, particularly in KS1, lack confidence in geography subject knowledge. Professional development should address both subject knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge for teaching geography effectively.

**Transition Specifics:** Provide specific training on EYFS-KS1 transition in geography, including common pitfalls and effective strategies.

## Conclusion

The transition from EYFS to KS1 represents both a challenge and an opportunity for geographical education. The challenge lies in bridging the gap between the experiential, emergent
