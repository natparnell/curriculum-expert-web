# Knowledge Building Across Topics in Geography

## Introduction: The Challenge of Curriculum Coherence

Geography is a vast and multifaceted discipline, encompassing physical processes, human interactions, environmental systems, and spatial relationships. The challenge for geography teachers is not merely covering this breadth of content, but constructing curricula that enable pupils to build coherent, cumulative knowledge over time. As Ofsted's Research Review Series: Geography (2021) emphasises, effective geography curricula must move beyond "collections of interesting topics" toward carefully sequenced learning that develops deep understanding and geographical capability.

This document examines the principles and practices of knowledge building across topics in geography education. It explores how curriculum coherence can be achieved through thoughtful sequencing, the role of interleaving and spaced practice in supporting retention, strategies for making explicit connections between topics, and the distinction between horizontal and vertical curriculum planning.

## Understanding Curriculum Coherence in Geography

### Defining Coherence

Curriculum coherence refers to the logical, meaningful connections between different elements of the curriculum—within and across topics, between lessons, and across key stages. A coherent geography curriculum is one in which pupils can see how their learning builds progressively, with each new topic extending and deepening their geographical understanding.

Ofsted (2021) identifies coherence as a hallmark of high-quality geography provision. In schools where curricula lack coherence, pupils encounter topics in isolation, fail to make connections between related concepts, and struggle to transfer knowledge from one context to another. By contrast, coherent curricula help pupils develop what the Geographical Association terms "a geographical lens"—a way of seeing and interpreting the world that draws on and integrates multiple aspects of geographical knowledge.

### The Architecture of Geographical Knowledge

To build coherent curricula, teachers must understand the architecture of geographical knowledge. This architecture comprises several interconnected elements:

**Substantive Knowledge**

Substantive knowledge in geography refers to the content pupils learn—the facts, concepts, processes, and examples that constitute the discipline. This includes:

- **Locational knowledge**: The position of places, features, and phenomena on Earth's surface
- **Place knowledge**: The characteristics that define particular places and regions
- **Human and physical processes**: The mechanisms that shape landscapes and human activities
- **Geographical phenomena**: Specific events, patterns, and relationships in the human and physical world

**Disciplinary Knowledge**

Disciplinary knowledge encompasses the ways of thinking and working that define geography as a subject. This includes:

- Geographical enquiry and investigation
- Map skills and spatial analysis
- Data handling and interpretation
- Fieldwork methodologies
- Evaluation of geographical evidence and arguments

**Procedural Knowledge**

Procedural knowledge involves the skills and techniques pupils use to engage with geographical content—reading maps, analysing images, constructing arguments, writing geographically.

Coherent curricula ensure that these three types of knowledge develop in tandem, with each reinforcing the others. For example, when studying climate change, pupils draw on substantive knowledge about atmospheric processes, disciplinary knowledge about how geographers investigate change over time, and procedural knowledge in interpreting climate data.

### The Problem of Fragmentation

Without careful curriculum design, geography can become fragmented. Pupils study volcanoes in Year 7, rivers in Year 8, and globalisation in Year 9, but fail to see how these topics connect. Each unit becomes a self-contained module, learned for the test then forgotten.

This fragmentation undermines both motivation and learning. Pupils struggle to see the relevance of isolated topics, and the effort invested in learning each unit yields limited long-term benefit because knowledge is not reinforced or applied in new contexts.

## Horizontal and Vertical Sequencing

### Horizontal Sequencing

Horizontal sequencing refers to the organisation of curriculum content within a single academic year or key stage. It concerns how topics are ordered and how connections are made between topics taught concurrently or in close proximity.

**Complementary Topics**

Horizontal sequencing can create powerful learning when complementary topics are taught together or in sequence. For example:

- **Ecosystems and climate**: Studying climate zones alongside biome distribution enables pupils to understand the relationship between climatic conditions and vegetation patterns
- **Population and resources**: Examining population change alongside resource consumption highlights the pressure of growing populations on finite resources
- **Coasts and coastal management**: Parallel study of physical coastal processes and human responses creates an integrated understanding of coastal systems

When topics are sequenced horizontally to reinforce each other, pupils develop richer mental models that connect different aspects of geographical knowledge.

**Thematic Integration**

Some curricula adopt a thematic approach to horizontal sequencing, organising content around overarching themes rather than discrete topics. For example:

- **"Interconnections"**: Exploring how global systems link people, places, and environments
- **"Sustainability"**: Examining environmental, economic, and social dimensions across multiple contexts
- **"Uneven development"**: Investigating spatial inequalities at various scales

Thematic integration requires careful planning to ensure adequate depth of content knowledge while enabling pupils to make meaningful connections.

### Vertical Sequencing

Vertical sequencing refers to the organisation of curriculum content across academic years and key stages. It concerns how knowledge builds cumulatively, with learning in earlier years providing foundations for more complex study later.

**Progressive Complexity**

Effective vertical sequencing introduces concepts at an appropriate level of complexity and revisits them with increasing sophistication:

- **Scale progression**: Beginning with local scale studies in Key Stage 2, expanding to national and regional scales in Key Stage 3, and engaging with global systems and processes at Key Stage 4 and beyond
- **Conceptual depth**: Introducing basic concepts (e.g., erosion, migration) early and developing more nuanced understanding over time (e.g., differential erosion, migration theories, complex drivers)
- **Methodological sophistication**: Developing enquiry skills from simple observations and questions toward complex investigations involving multiple sources and sophisticated analysis

**Prerequisite Knowledge**

Vertical sequencing must ensure that prerequisite knowledge is in place before pupils encounter dependent concepts. For example:

- Understanding of tectonic plate theory is essential before studying volcanic and seismic hazards
- Knowledge of weather and climate is necessary for studying biome distribution
- Familiarity with economic concepts helps pupils understand patterns of global development

Curriculum planning should map these dependencies explicitly, ensuring that foundational knowledge is secure before building upon it.

**Spiralling Curriculum**

A spiralling approach to vertical sequencing revisits topics at intervals, with each encounter building upon and extending previous learning. This contrasts with a purely linear approach where topics are covered once and then abandoned.

For example, the concept of development might be encountered:

- **Year 7**: Introduction to development indicators and the development gap
- **Year 8**: Exploration of factors affecting development, including historical, political, and environmental dimensions
- **Year 9**: Critical examination of development theories and alternative models beyond GDP
- **Key Stage 4**: Application of development concepts to case studies, evaluation of development strategies

Each encounter deepens understanding while reinforcing and extending prior learning.

## Interleaving and Spaced Practice

### The Power of Interleaving

Interleaving is the practice of mixing different topics, concepts, or problem types within a learning sequence, rather than blocking study of each topic separately. Research in cognitive science suggests that interleaving can enhance learning and retention compared to blocked practice.

In geography, interleaving might involve:

- **Mixed topic review**: Homework or starter activities that revisit multiple topics from across the curriculum
- **Comparative case studies**: Examining different geographical phenomena side-by-side rather than in isolation
- **Integrated assessments**: Examination questions or projects that require knowledge from multiple topics

**Benefits of Interleaving**

Interleaving supports geographical learning in several ways:

1. **Discrimination**: Pupils learn to identify which concepts and approaches are relevant to different situations. When all problems in a lesson relate to rivers, pupils know to apply river knowledge without thinking. When problems are mixed, pupils must actively select appropriate knowledge.

2. **Retrieval strength**: The effort of switching between topics strengthens memory and retrieval pathways. Each switch requires pupils to reactivate knowledge from long-term memory.

3. **Connection making**: Interleaving naturally highlights relationships between topics as pupils encounter them in proximity.

### Implementing Interleaving in Geography

**Starter Activities and Do Now Tasks**

Short activities at the beginning of lessons can provide regular interleaving. A starter might:

- Present an image related to last term's topic and ask pupils to explain the geographical processes visible
- Pose a question requiring knowledge from multiple previous units
- Show a map and ask pupils to identify features studied in different contexts

These brief encounters with prior learning maintain knowledge across the curriculum without requiring extensive curriculum time.

**Retrieval Practice Quizzes**

Regular low-stakes quizzes that sample content from across the curriculum provide powerful interleaving. Effective geography quizzes might include questions on:

- Locational knowledge from various regions
- Key concepts from different topics
- Case studies studied at different times
- Geographical skills applied in various contexts

**Synoptic Assessment**

Synoptic assessments require pupils to draw on knowledge from multiple topics to address complex geographical questions. For example:

- "How do physical and human factors combine to create flood risk in Bangladesh?" (requiring knowledge of rivers, climate, population, and development)
- "Explain how globalisation has affected the economy and environment of different regions" (requiring knowledge of globalisation, economic geography, and environmental systems)

Synoptic assessment makes interleaving integral to the curriculum rather than an add-on.

### Spaced Practice

Spaced practice involves distributing learning and review over time rather than concentrating it in a single block. Like interleaving, spacing is supported by extensive research on memory and learning.

**Spacing in Curriculum Design**

Geography curricula can incorporate spacing through:

- **Distributed topics**: Rather than studying all aspects of a topic in a single block, content is distributed across the year
- **Return visits**: Topics are revisited after intervals of days, weeks, or months
- **Cumulative assessment**: Assessments draw on content from across the year, not just recent lessons

**The Forgetting Curve**

Spacing works with, rather than against, the natural process of forgetting. As pupils forget content, retrieval becomes effortful, and this effort strengthens memory. Curricula that never revisit topics allow forgetting to proceed unchecked. Curricula that space review strategically interrupt forgetting and build durable knowledge.

**Implementation Challenges**

Both interleaving and spacing can feel less effective to learners than blocked, massed practice. Pupils often prefer to study one topic at a time and may feel that mixed review is confusing or unproductive. Teachers need to explain the rationale for these approaches and trust the research evidence even when immediate performance seems lower than with blocked practice.

## Making Connections Between Topics

### Explicit Connection Making

Curriculum coherence requires that connections between topics be made explicit for pupils. Without explicit instruction, many pupils fail to recognise relationships that seem obvious to subject experts.

**Conceptual Links**

Teachers should articulate how concepts apply across different topics:

- **Systems thinking**: The concept of systems (inputs, processes, outputs, feedback) applies to rivers, coasts, ecosystems, urban areas, and economic activities
- **Scale**: Geographical phenomena operate at and interact across local, national, regional, and global scales in every topic
- **Sustainability**: Questions of environmental, economic, and social sustainability arise in every geographical context
- **Interdependence**: Connections between places and processes are a feature of all geographical study

By highlighting these cross-cutting concepts, teachers help pupils develop transferable geographical thinking.

**Substantive Links**

Beyond conceptual connections, topics often have substantive links that should be made explicit:

- **Climate connects to**: ecosystems, agriculture, water resources, hazards, migration, energy
- **Tectonics connects to**: hazards, landscape formation, human settlement patterns, resource distribution
- **Development connects to**: population, migration, urbanisation, globalisation, environmental change

Curriculum planning should identify these links, and teaching should regularly reference them.

### Comparative Approaches

Comparing and contrasting different geographical phenomena is a powerful way to build connections:

**Compare Similar Processes in Different Contexts**

- Coastal erosion in the UK versus coral atoll erosion in the Pacific
- Urban growth in Lagos versus London
- Agricultural change in the UK versus Brazil

**Compare Different Processes in the Same Context**

- Physical and human factors affecting a single region
- Historical and contemporary geographical changes in one place
- Multiple stakeholders' perspectives on a geographical issue

**Compare at Different Scales**

- Local, national, and global dimensions of the same phenomenon
- How processes operate differently at different scales

Comparison naturally requires pupils to activate knowledge from multiple topics and identify patterns and distinctions.

### Synoptic Thinking

Synoptic thinking involves seeing the whole picture—understanding how multiple factors interact in complex geographical situations. It represents the highest level of curriculum coherence, where pupils can draw flexibly on their entire geographical toolkit to address novel questions.

**Developing Synoptic Capability**

Synoptic thinking develops gradually through:

1. **Explicit modelling**: Teachers model how they draw on multiple areas of knowledge to answer questions
2. **Scaffolded practice**: Pupils practise making connections with structured support
3. **Independent application**: Pupils independently identify relevant knowledge for complex problems
4. **Reflective review**: Regular opportunities to review and consolidate connections

**Assessment of Synoptic Understanding**

Assessment can evaluate synoptic capability through:

- Questions that require knowledge from specified topic areas
- Unseen case studies requiring application of prior learning
- Extended writing requiring integration of multiple concepts
- Projects investigating complex real-world geographical issues

## Curriculum Mapping and Planning

### Mapping Knowledge Dependencies

Effective curriculum planning begins with mapping the dependencies between different elements of geographical knowledge. This involves identifying:

**Prerequisite Knowledge**
- What must pupils know before they can access each topic?
- What concepts underpin more complex understanding?
- What skills are needed for particular enquiries?

**Related Knowledge**
- What topics reinforce each other?
- What concepts cut across multiple topics?
- What case studies illustrate multiple themes?

**Future Applications**
- How will this topic be built upon later?
- What foundations are being laid for Key Stage 4 and beyond?
- What knowledge should be retained and reactivated?

### The Knowledge Organiser Approach

Knowledge organisers can support coherence by making explicit the core knowledge for each topic and highlighting connections to prior and future learning. Effective geography knowledge organisers include:

- **Key concepts** for the topic
- **Core vocabulary** with definitions
- **Case study details** to be learned
- **Maps and diagrams** showing key spatial patterns
- **Prior knowledge** required for the topic
- **Future learning** that will build on this topic

When used consistently across a department, knowledge organisers create a visible architecture of the curriculum that supports both teaching and learning.

### Curriculum Review and Refinement

Building coherent curricula is an ongoing process requiring regular review:

**Evaluating Coherence**
- Can pupils articulate connections between topics?
- Do assessments reveal understanding of relationships between topics?
- Are there topics that seem isolated or disconnected?

**Identifying Gaps**
- Are there prerequisite knowledge gaps that hinder progress?
- Do pupils retain knowledge from earlier topics?
- Are cross-cutting concepts sufficiently emphasised?

**Iterative Improvement**
- Adjust sequencing based on pupil learning
- Strengthen explicit connection making where needed
- Increase interleaving and spacing gradually

## Pedagogical Strategies for Coherent Teaching

### Retrieval Practice Across the Curriculum

Regular retrieval practice that samples content from across the curriculum reinforces coherence:

**Daily Review**
- Brief questions at the start of lessons revisiting prior topics
- Mixed recall of vocabulary, concepts, and case studies
- Quick-fire factual recall combined with explanation tasks

**Weekly and Monthly Review**
- Longer quizzes covering content from across the year
- Self-testing opportunities for pupils
- Identification of knowledge gaps for targeted revision

**Spaced Retrieval**
- Planned return to topics after intervals
- Cumulative assessment requiring recall of earlier content
- Revision of prior learning before introducing related new content

### Explanations that Connect

Teacher explanations should regularly make explicit links:

**Linking to Prior Learning**
- "Remember when we studied river processes? This coastal erosion works in a similar way..."
- "The population dynamics we explored last term help explain migration patterns..."
- "This is another example of the systems thinking we've applied in other contexts..."

**Anticipating Future Learning**
- "Understanding this process will be essential when we study climate change..."
- "We're building foundations here for more complex analysis at GCSE..."

**Cross-Referencing**
- "How does this compare to what we learned about...?"
- "What would a geographer studying [other topic] notice here?"

### Questioning for Connection Making

Strategic questioning can prompt pupils to make connections:

- "How is this similar to what we learned about...?"
- "What knowledge from previous topics helps us understand this?"
- "Where else have we encountered this concept?"
- "How would a different scale of analysis change what we see?"

Such questions train pupils to think across the curriculum and develop their own capacity for connection making.

## Conclusion: Toward Coherent Geographical Understanding

Curriculum coherence in geography is not accidental—it results from deliberate, principled planning and teaching. By attending to horizontal and vertical sequencing, incorporating interleaving and spaced practice, making explicit connections between topics, and regularly reviewing and refining curriculum design, teachers can help pupils build the coherent geographical understanding that enables them to see the world through a geographical lens.

The goal is not merely coverage of content but the development of capable geographical thinkers who can draw flexibly on their knowledge to understand and engage with the complex spatial world they inhabit. Coherent curricula are essential to achieving this ambition.
