# Key Stage 3 Geography Curriculum Frameworks

## Overview

The Key Stage 3 (KS3) geography curriculum in England serves as the critical bridge between primary geographical foundations and the specialised study at GCSE and A-Level. Following the 2013 National Curriculum reforms implemented in September 2014, the KS3 Programme of Study (PoS) for geography is deliberately concise, setting out core knowledge without prescribing specific teaching approaches or sequences (Department for Education, 2013). This intentional brevity empowers geography departments to exercise professional judgement in curriculum design whilst working within statutory requirements.

The Ofsted Research Review for Geography (2021) identified that geography was "particularly weak" at KS3 in many schools, with pupils sometimes receiving "very little specific" geography education. This finding elevated the importance of coherent, well-sequenced KS3 curriculum frameworks that build systematically towards disciplinary expertise.

## The Statutory Foundation: National Curriculum Requirements

### Purpose of Study

The National Curriculum states that geography should inspire in pupils a curiosity and fascination about the world and its people that will remain with them for the rest of their lives. The 2013 PoS establishes that geographical knowledge, understanding and skills provide the frameworks and approaches that explain how the Earth's features at different scales are shaped, interconnected and change over time (DfE, 2013).

### Aims

The statutory aims require that all pupils should:

- Develop contextual knowledge of the location of globally significant places—both terrestrial and marine—including their defining physical and human characteristics and how these provide a geographical context for understanding the actions of processes
- Understand the processes that give rise to key physical and human geographical features of the world, how these are interdependent and how they bring about spatial variation and change over time
- Be competent in the geographical skills needed to collect, analyse and communicate with a range of data gathered through experiences of fieldwork that deepen their understanding of geographical processes
- Communicate geographical information in a variety of ways, including through maps, numerical and quantitative skills and writing at length

### Subject Content

The statutory content for KS3 geography comprises five interrelated domains:

#### 1. Locational Knowledge

Pupils must extend their locational knowledge and deepen their spatial awareness of the world's countries, using maps of the world to focus on Africa, Russia, Asia (including China and India), and the Middle East. They must also locate key features of the United Kingdom, including its major cities, rivers, mountain ranges and topographical features.

#### 2. Place Knowledge

Pupils should understand geographical similarities, differences and links between places through the study of human and physical geography of a region in Africa, and a region in Asia or the Middle East. This requirement establishes the comparative study of places as a core disciplinary practice.

#### 3. Human and Physical Geography

Pupils must build on KS2 knowledge to understand key processes in physical and human geography. Physical geography encompasses weathering, rock cycle, river landscapes, coastal landscapes, natural hazards, and ecosystems. Human geography includes population, urbanisation, economic activity, development, and the use of natural resources.

#### 4. Geographical Skills and Fieldwork

Pupils must build on KS2 skills to utilise Ordnance Survey maps, atlases, globes, and digital/computer mapping. They must interpret a range of sources including aerial photographs, and undertake fieldwork in contrasting locations to collect, analyse and draw conclusions from geographical data.

#### 5. Map Skills and Technical Procedures

The PoS specifies competence in using grid references, understanding map symbols, measuring distance and direction, and working with different map scales and projections.

## The Four Key Concepts: The GA Curriculum Framework

The Geographical Association's *Framework for the School Geography Curriculum* identifies four organising concepts that provide coherence across the subject. These concepts—**place, space, environment, and Earth systems**—function as the disciplinary pillars upon which coherent KS3 curricula should be constructed (Geographical Association, 2023).

### Place

Place refers to locations at all scales from the personal to the global, each having distinctive characteristics that give them meaning for people. At KS3, the concept of place involves:

- Understanding that places are multi-faceted and can be understood through different lenses (physical characteristics, human activities, cultural significance, economic function)
- Recognising that people's perceptions and representations of places vary according to their standpoint and experiences
- Exploring how places change over time and how they are connected to other places through flows of people, ideas, goods, and information
- Investigating the unique characteristics of specific places whilst identifying patterns and similarities across different locations

**Pedagogical approaches:** Effective place-based teaching at KS3 moves beyond "location spotting" to develop deep place knowledge. This includes using case studies that reveal the complexity of places, exploring diverse representations (including those of inhabitants, visitors, and media), and examining how places are shaped by and shape human identities. Teachers should avoid reducing places to stereotypical or exoticised representations, instead presenting places as dynamic, contested, and interconnected.

### Space

Space refers to the locations of features and how they are distributed, the spatial patterns that result, and the spatial processes that create and change them. The concept encompasses:

- Absolute and relative location, including the use of coordinate systems (latitude and longitude) and other referencing frameworks
- Spatial patterns, distributions, and relationships between phenomena across different scales
- Spatial processes including diffusion, migration, globalisation, and spatial interaction
- The ways in which human activities create, transform, and give meaning to spaces

**Pedagogical approaches:** The Ofsted Research Review (2021) emphasised that "pupils need to be taught about the absolute positioning (reference) systems in geography, particularly latitude and longitude. Location influences so many of the earth's systems that without a grasp of it early in their education, pupils do not have one of the critical geographical frameworks that allow them to make sense of many natural and human phenomena."

At KS3, teachers should embed spatial thinking throughout the curriculum, ensuring pupils regularly work with maps at multiple scales, analyse spatial patterns using GIS and other tools, and understand how spatial relationships shape human and physical processes.

### Environment

Environment encompasses the natural and human-influenced conditions in which people live, and the interactions between people and their environments. The concept includes:

- Physical environments including weather, climate, landforms, soils, vegetation, and ecosystems
- Human-environment interactions including resource use, environmental management, sustainability, and environmental impact
- Environmental change at various timescales, from seasonal to geological and human-induced
- Environmental issues including climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and resource depletion

**Pedagogical approaches:** The environment concept provides opportunities for values-based education, though teachers should maintain disciplinary rigour. Rather than approaching environmental topics purely through advocacy, KS3 geography should develop pupils' capacity to analyse environmental systems, evaluate different management approaches using evidence, and understand the geographical dimensions of environmental challenges. This includes examining how environmental issues affect different places and groups unevenly, introducing concepts of environmental justice.

### Earth Systems

Earth systems refers to the integrated physical and biological systems of the planet, including the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere, and the interactions between them. This concept encompasses:

- The major Earth systems and their components, processes, and interactions
- Biogeochemical cycles including the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nutrient cycles
- Plate tectonics and associated processes (earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building)
- Weather and climate systems, including atmospheric circulation and ocean currents
- Ecosystems and biomes as integrated systems

**Pedagogical approaches:** Teaching Earth systems at KS3 requires developing pupils' understanding of complexity, interconnection, and scale. Rather than treating physical geography as a catalogue of landforms or processes, effective curricula present the Earth as a dynamic, interconnected system. This includes using systems language (inputs, processes, outputs, feedback) to help pupils analyse geographical phenomena, and exploring how human activities interact with and modify Earth systems.

## Curriculum Design Principles: From Intent to Implementation

### Continuity and Progression

The Geographical Association (2023) identifies three related planning concepts that underpin effective KS3 curriculum design:

**Continuity** refers to the maintenance and development of different aspects of geography within the curriculum. This means ensuring that key concepts, themes, and skills recur throughout the three years of KS3, rather than being taught once and forgotten.

**Progression** means the measurable advances in knowledge, understanding and skills made by students over time. In geography, this involves:

- Moving from describing features and patterns to explaining processes and causes
- Developing from concrete understanding of observable phenomena to more abstract conceptual thinking
- Increasing the complexity and scale of geographical understanding
- Developing more sophisticated use of geographical vocabulary and concepts
- Moving from teacher-supported enquiry to more independent investigation

**Sequencing** refers to the deliberate ordering of curriculum content to build learning effectively. The Ofsted Research Review (2021) found that "careful and deliberate sequencing is required if we wish students to build progressively and securely on their prior learning." Effective sequencing in KS3 geography:

- Builds from concrete to abstract (e.g., from studying local weather to understanding global atmospheric circulation)
- Moves from familiar to unfamiliar (e.g., from UK geography to regional studies of less familiar locations)
- Develops prerequisite knowledge before dependent content (e.g., establishing rock types before river erosion processes)
- Returns to and builds upon prior learning in new contexts (spiral curriculum design)

### Big Ideas and Threads

Many successful KS3 curricula identify "big ideas" or organising threads that run through the three-year programme. These may include:

- **Interconnection:** How places, processes, and phenomena are linked across space
- **Sustainability:** The challenges of meeting human needs within environmental limits
- **Inequality:** The uneven distribution of resources, opportunities, and life chances across the world
- **Change:** The dynamic nature of places, environments, and human societies
- **Scale:** How geographical phenomena appear differently at local, regional, national, and global scales

The Oak National Academy geography curriculum, for example, uses threads such as "inequality" to help pupils understand patterns of development, population, settlement and trade, informed by the broader key concepts of environment, space, place and Earth systems (Oak National Academy, 2023).

### The Role of Substantive and Disciplinary Knowledge

The Ofsted Research Review (2021) distinguishes between:

**Substantive knowledge** refers to the content of geography—what geographers know about the world. This includes locational knowledge, place knowledge, and understanding of human and physical processes.

**Disciplinary knowledge** refers to how geographical knowledge is created, tested, and debated. This includes understanding how geographers investigate the world, the methods they use, and how geographical claims are evaluated.

Effective KS3 curricula integrate both types of knowledge. For example, when studying rivers, pupils learn substantive knowledge about erosion processes and landforms, whilst also developing disciplinary knowledge about how geographers investigate river systems through fieldwork and why different interpretations of river behaviour exist.

## Pedagogical Approaches for KS3 Geography

### Enquiry-Based Learning

Enquiry-based learning is widely advocated for KS3 geography. The Geographical Association (2023) notes that fieldwork learning outcomes should be derived directly from the curriculum unit of which the activity is part, with classroom teaching setting the scene for fieldwork and following up afterwards to consolidate learning.

Effective geographical enquiry at KS3 involves:

- Starting with questions that are genuinely geographical and appropriately challenging
- Providing structured support for pupils to investigate using geographical sources and methods
- Ensuring enquiries build geographical knowledge and understanding, not just generic research skills
- Concluding with opportunities for pupils to communicate findings using geographical conventions

### The Use of Varied Examples

The Ofsted Research Review (2021) emphasises the importance of using varied examples to develop deep understanding. Rather than studying a phenomenon once, effective curricula revisit geographical concepts using different examples to develop transferable understanding. For example:

- Studying volcanoes in Iceland, Italy, and Japan to understand different volcanic contexts and impacts
- Examining urbanisation in Brazil, Nigeria, and the UK to appreciate diverse urban experiences
- Comparing river systems in the UK and Bangladesh to understand how similar processes create different outcomes in different contexts

### Developing Geographical Vocabulary

The National Curriculum requires pupils to communicate geographical information "at length" using appropriate vocabulary. Effective KS3 curricula:

- Identify and explicitly teach tier 2 and tier 3 geographical vocabulary
- Provide regular opportunities for pupils to use geographical terms in speech and writing
- Use etymology to help pupils understand and remember technical terms
- Expect precise use of geographical language in pupil work

### Low-Stakes Retrieval Practice

Research-informed practice suggests that regular low-stakes testing aids checking for understanding and helps identify misconceptions. At KS3, this might include:

- Regular map-based quizzes to consolidate locational knowledge
- Retrieval practice of key vocabulary and concepts
- Quick diagnostic questions to check understanding of processes
- Exit tickets to assess learning at lesson end

## Common Misconceptions at KS3

Understanding common misconceptions allows teachers to anticipate and address them proactively.

### Locational Knowledge Misconceptions

- **Confusing scale:** Pupils may confuse cities with countries, or continents with countries (e.g., placing Russia between Africa and Asia)
- **Equatorial bias:** Assuming all areas near the equator are hot deserts, failing to understand tropical rainforest and savanna climates
- **Static understanding:** Viewing borders and place names as permanent rather than historically contingent

### Physical Geography Misconceptions

- **River processes:** Confusing erosion and deposition, or believing rivers flow from north to south
- **Weather and climate:** Using these terms interchangeably, or believing cold weather disproves climate change
- **Tectonics:** Thinking continents drift on ocean floors, or misunderstanding the relationship between earthquakes and volcanoes
- **Coastal processes:** Believing all coastlines erode, failing to understand deposition and dynamic equilibrium

### Human Geography Misconceptions

- **Development:** Associating development solely with economic wealth, ignoring social and environmental dimensions
- **Population:** Assuming rapid population growth in all countries, failing to understand demographic transition
- **Globalisation:** Viewing globalisation as uniformly positive or negative, rather than geographically uneven
- **Migration:** Confusing internal and international migration, or assuming migration is primarily from poor to rich countries

### Conceptual Misconceptions

- **Place stereotypes:** Viewing places as uniformly characterised by particular features (e.g., all of Africa as savanna with wildlife)
- **Environmental determinism:** Assuming climate and terrain directly determine human behaviour and development
- **Scale confusion:** Failing to recognise how processes operate differently at different scales

## Assessment in KS3 Geography

The Ofsted Research Review (2021) is critical of assessment approaches that fragment the curriculum into disconnected assessments, noting that "the nature of the geography curriculum, being cumulative, means that knowledge of complexity is often not reached until pupils are nearing the end of the key stage."

Effective KS3 assessment:

- Aligns with curriculum intent and measures what has been taught
- Uses a range of methods including written work, oral contributions, map work, and fieldwork
- Focuses on assessing geographical understanding rather than generic skills
- Provides feedback that helps pupils improve their geographical thinking
- Identifies and addresses misconceptions

The Geographical Association (2023) advises that assessment should be manageable and purposeful, providing useful information about what pupils know and can do, whilst avoiding excessive workload for teachers.

## Transition and Progression

### From KS2 to KS3

The transition from primary to secondary geography presents both opportunities and challenges. Ofsted research (2020) found that most primary schools were revising their geography curricula, but almost half did not teach the breadth of knowledge set out in the National Curriculum, particularly in KS2.

Effective transition at KS3:

- Assesses and builds upon prior learning rather than assuming it
- Consolidates and extends KS2 locational knowledge before introducing new locations
- Revisits map skills before expecting independent application
- Makes explicit connections to primary learning to help pupils see progression

### From KS3 to KS4

The Ofsted Subject Report: Geography (2023) found that "in many schools there was little sense of knowledge building across topics" at KS3, with each topic sitting in isolation. However, the exception was in KS3 where leaders had often planned how knowledge learned in one topic would be used in later topics.

Effective KS3 curricula prepare pupils for GCSE by:

- Developing secure foundational knowledge that GCSE specifications assume
- Introducing and reinforcing key concepts that GCSEs develop in greater depth
- Building geographical skills including map work, data analysis, and extended writing
- Developing the habits of geographical thinking that GCSE requires
- Maintaining rigorous geographical study rather than treating KS3 as merely a "taster" for GCSE
