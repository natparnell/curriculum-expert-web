# A-Level Geography Content

## Overview and Regulatory Context

A-Level Geography represents the culmination of pre-university geographical education in England, with specifications governed by the Department for Education's subject content criteria (December 2014) and Ofqual's general regulations for GCE qualifications. The qualification builds upon GCSE foundations while introducing greater conceptual sophistication, extended writing requirements, and independent research through the Non-Examined Assessment (NEA).

The DfE subject content specifies that A-Level Geography must provide students with knowledge and understanding of geographical concepts, processes, and interactions; the ability to apply geographical knowledge to unfamiliar contexts; skills in geographical investigation including fieldwork and research; competence in using quantitative and qualitative data; and the ability to think critically, construct arguments, and evaluate evidence.

All awarding organisations (AQA, Edexcel, OCR, Eduqas) must meet these core content requirements while having flexibility in how they structure optional content and assessment (Geographical Association, 2023).

## Assessment Structure

### Component Weightings

A-Level Geography typically comprises three components:

**Physical Geography (40% of A-Level)**
- Assessed through written examination
- Focus on systems thinking, natural processes, and human-environment interactions
- Includes extended writing questions requiring evaluation and synthesis

**Human Geography (40% of A-Level)**
- Assessed through written examination  
- Focus on global systems, human processes, and changing places
- Emphasises application of knowledge to contemporary issues

**Geographical Investigation/NEA (20% of A-Level)**
- Independent fieldwork investigation of 3,000–4,000 words
- Students define their own question, collect primary and secondary data, and analyse findings
- Marked by centres and moderated by awarding organisations

### Assessment Objectives

Ofqual specifies four Assessment Objectives (AOs) common to all specifications:

**AO1:** Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of places, environments, concepts, processes, interactions, and change at a variety of scales

**AO2:** Apply knowledge and understanding in different contexts to interpret, analyse, and evaluate geographical information and issues

**AO3:** Use a variety of relevant quantitative, qualitative, and fieldwork skills to investigate geographical questions and issues

**AO4:** Select, adapt, and use a variety of quantitative and qualitative skills to analyse and evaluate geographical questions, issues, and problems

## Core Physical Geography Content

### Water and Carbon Cycles

The water and carbon cycles form the foundation of physical geography at A-Level, taught through a systems approach that emphasises interconnectedness and dynamic equilibrium.

**Systems Concepts**
- Open and closed systems with inputs, outputs, stores, and flows
- Energy transfers: solar energy drives evaporation and transpiration
- Feedback mechanisms: positive feedback amplifies changes; negative feedback dampens changes
- Dynamic equilibrium: systems adjust to changing conditions while maintaining overall stability
- Thresholds and tipping points: critical points where small changes trigger large responses

**The Water Cycle**
- Global distribution: oceans (97.5%), ice caps (1.74%), groundwater (0.76%), surface water (0.01%), atmosphere (0.001%)
- Key processes: precipitation, interception, infiltration, throughflow, percolation, evaporation, transpiration
- Drainage basins as open systems with inputs, outputs, stores, and flows
- River regimes and hydrographs: seasonal variation; lag time, rising limb, peak discharge, falling limb

**The Carbon Cycle**
- Global carbon stores: lithosphere (fossil fuels), hydrosphere (dissolved CO2), biosphere (vegetation, soils), atmosphere
- Key processes: photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, combustion, natural sequestration
- Terrestrial and oceanic carbon cycling
- Carbon budget: balance between sources and sinks

**Water-Carbon Interactions**
- Climate change impacts: melting ice, increased evaporation, permafrost thaw, ocean acidification
- Human influences: deforestation, fossil fuel combustion, land use change
- Case studies: Amazon rainforest, Arctic permafrost, coral reefs

### Coastal Systems and Landscapes

**Coastal Processes**
- Marine processes: wave formation (wind speed, duration, fetch), refraction, constructive vs destructive waves
- Erosion: hydraulic action, abrasion, attrition, solution
- Transport: longshore drift, traction, saltation, suspension
- Deposition: beaches, spits, bars, tombolos

**Coastal Landforms**
- Erosional: cliffs, wave-cut platforms, caves, arches, stacks, stumps
- Depositional: beaches, spits, bars, tombolos, barrier islands
- Sub-aerial processes: weathering, mass movement

**Coastal Management**
- Hard engineering: sea walls, groynes, rock armour, revetments, gabions
- Soft engineering: beach nourishment, dune regeneration, marsh creation, managed retreat
- Sustainable approaches: Integrated Coastal Zone Management
- Case studies: Holderness Coast, Jurassic Coast, Bangladesh

### Hazards

**Tectonic Hazards**
- Plate tectonics: constructive, destructive, conservative boundaries; hotspots
- Earthquakes: seismic waves, magnitude scales, intensity scales
- Volcanoes: magma composition, eruption types, VEI
- Secondary hazards: tsunamis, liquefaction, landslides, lahars, pyroclastic flows
- Case studies: Japan 2011, Haiti 2010, Eyjafjallajökull 2010

**Storm Hazards**
- Tropical storms: formation conditions, structure (eye, eyewall, rainbands), tracks
- Impacts: primary and secondary
- Case studies: Hurricane Katrina 2005, Cyclone Nargis 2008, Typhoon Haiyan 2013

**Hazard Management**
- Risk equation: Risk = Hazard × Vulnerability ÷ Capacity
- Prediction, preparedness, response, recovery
- Disaster risk reduction: UN Sendai Framework

## Non-Examined Assessment (NEA)

### Purpose and Scope

The NEA constitutes 20% of the A-Level and requires students to:
- Define a geographical question for investigation
- Design and undertake independent fieldwork
- Use secondary data to supplement primary research
- Analyse data using appropriate techniques
- Draw conclusions and evaluate limitations
- Report findings in 3,000–4,000 words

### Investigation Design

**Question Formulation**
- Questions should be geographical, focused, and feasible
- Types: spatial comparisons, changes over time, variable relationships

**Methodology**
- Primary data techniques appropriate to the question
- Sampling strategies and their limitations
- Ethical considerations and risk assessment

**Common Topics**
- Changing places: perceptions, demographic change, regeneration
- Urban environments: housing quality, environmental quality
- Coastal systems: beach profiles, erosion rates
- Rivers: channel characteristics, flood risk

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Teaching Systems Thinking

The Royal Geographical Society emphasises that water and carbon cycles are understood through a systems approach. Effective strategies include:
- Physical models demonstrating inputs, outputs, stores
- Drawing feedback loops
- Applying systems concepts across topics
- Using simulations to explore system behaviour

### Developing Extended Writing

A-Level requires substantial extended writing. Effective approaches include:
- PEEL paragraph structure
- Synoptic links between specification areas
- Regular timed essay practice
- Use of mark schemes and exemplars
- Focus on evaluation and alternative perspectives

### Fieldwork Pedagogy

The Geographical Association and Field Studies Council recommend:
- Progressive skill development from Year 12 to 13
- Integrating fieldwork with classroom learning
- Using fieldwork data for classroom analysis
- Critical evaluation of methods and data quality

## Common Student Misconceptions

**Systems Thinking**
- Confusing positive and negative feedback
- Believing systems naturally tend toward equilibrium
- Treating cycles as completely closed systems

**Physical Geography**
- Thinking all coasts erode at similar rates
- Believing hard engineering is always better than soft
- Confusing magnitude and intensity for earthquakes

**Human Geography**
- Assuming globalisation is uniform and inevitable
- Treating developed/developing as binary categories
- Assuming migration is always poor to rich countries
