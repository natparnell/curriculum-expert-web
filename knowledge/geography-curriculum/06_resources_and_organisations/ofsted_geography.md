# Ofsted and Geography Education

## Overview

Ofsted, the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills, plays a significant role in shaping geography education in England through its inspection framework, research reviews, and subject reports. Understanding Ofsted's expectations and findings is essential for geography subject leaders, teachers, and senior leaders seeking to develop high-quality provision in their schools.

Ofsted's engagement with geography education intensified with the introduction of the Education Inspection Framework (EIF) in 2019, which brought a sharper focus on the curriculum through the three Is: Intent, Implementation, and Impact. This was followed by the publication of a comprehensive research review in June 2021 and a subject report, *Getting Our Bearings*, in September 2023. Together, these documents provide a coherent picture of what Ofsted considers high-quality geography education.

## The Ofsted Research Review (2021)

### Purpose and Context

Published in June 2021, the *Research Review Series: Geography* was the first of Ofsted's subject-specific research reviews. It aimed to identify the factors that contribute to high-quality geography education based on available research evidence. The review was concerned with the fundamental question of "what it means to get better at geography" and sought to establish a shared understanding of the subject's knowledge base and how it develops.

The research review drew on a range of sources, including academic research, professional association publications (particularly from the Geographical Association and Royal Geographical Society), and Ofsted's own inspection evidence. It was intended to inform both curriculum developers and inspectors about the characteristics of effective geography education.

### Key Concepts: Substantive and Disciplinary Knowledge

A central contribution of the research review was its clear articulation of two forms of knowledge in geography:

**Substantive knowledge** refers to the content that pupils learn—the facts, concepts, and information that constitute geographical understanding. This includes knowledge of locations, places, physical and human processes, and environmental issues. The review emphasised that substantive knowledge in geography should be broad, covering the full scope of the subject rather than narrow topics that happen to interest teachers.

**Disciplinary knowledge** refers to how geographical knowledge is created, contested, and validated. It encompasses understanding of geographical methods, including fieldwork, spatial analysis, and the use of geographical information systems (GIS). The review stressed that pupils should learn how geographers investigate the world, not merely what geographers have discovered.

The relationship between these two forms of knowledge is symbiotic. Substantive knowledge provides the content for disciplinary thinking, while disciplinary knowledge enables pupils to question, interrogate, and extend their substantive understanding. Effective curricula plan for the development of both.

### Curriculum Planning Principles

The research review identified several principles for effective geography curriculum planning:

**Component knowledge**—teachers should break down complex geographical concepts into smaller, manageable components that can be taught explicitly before being synthesised into more sophisticated understanding.

**Sequencing**—the order in which content is taught matters. Curriculum planning should consider both logical progression within topics and the accumulation of knowledge across topics and key stages.

**Breadth and balance**—curricula should cover the full breadth of geography as defined in the national curriculum, avoiding over-emphasis on certain topics at the expense of others. Place knowledge, physical geography, human geography, and geographical skills all require appropriate attention.

**The national curriculum as a minimum**—the national curriculum should be seen as the baseline for curriculum design, not the ceiling. High-quality curricula go beyond statutory requirements to provide rich, ambitious geographical education.

## The Subject Report: Getting Our Bearings (2023)

### Purpose and Methodology

Published in September 2023, *Getting Our Bearings: Geography Subject Report* built on the foundations of the 2021 research review by examining how geography was actually being taught in schools across England. The report drew on evidence gathered through routine inspections and research visits to a sample of primary and secondary schools, including Reception classes and sixth forms.

The report was structured around the three Is of the EIF, examining curriculum intent, implementation, and impact in both primary and secondary phases. It aimed to identify common strengths and weaknesses while recognising that there are many valid ways to achieve high-quality geography education.

### Primary Findings

The subject report identified significant improvements in geography education since the previous subject report in 2011. Leaders had invested considerable effort in rewriting curriculum plans to better identify what should be taught and how pupils' knowledge should build over time. The ambitious nature of geography curricula had also improved, with greater attention to representing the distinctive character of the subject.

However, the report also identified persistent challenges:

**Curriculum isolation**—while knowledge often built effectively within individual topics, there was frequently little sense of knowledge building across topics. Each topic sat in isolation rather than contributing to a coherent progression of geographical understanding.

**EYFS to Key Stage 1 transition**—changes to the Early Years Foundation Stage had introduced more geographical content, particularly vocabulary, but the Key Stage 1 curriculum sometimes did not progress significantly beyond what pupils had learned in Reception.

**Curriculum narrowing**—some curricula did not match the scope and ambition of the national curriculum, often because place knowledge or geographical skills were inadequately addressed.

**Time allocation**—schools varied widely in the time allocated to geography, with insufficient time making it difficult to achieve ambitious curriculum goals.

**Topic dilution**—when geography was combined with history in cross-curricular topics, geography often took second place, with little substantial geographical content being taught.

### Secondary Findings

In secondary schools, the report found notable improvements but also significant concerns:

**Exam specification as curriculum**—at Key Stage 4, exam specifications had frequently become the de facto curriculum, with leaders simply working through content point by point. This resulted in pupils struggling to see connections between topics or understand the bigger picture of geography as a discipline.

**Key Stage 3 as the weak link**—despite improvements, Key Stage 3 remained the weakest phase of secondary geography education, with some pupils receiving very little specific geographical education.

**Fieldwork limitations**—fieldwork at Key Stages 4 and 5 rarely extended beyond minimum exam board requirements, and the COVID-19 pandemic had further reduced opportunities for practical geographical investigation.

**Disciplinary knowledge gaps**—while substantive knowledge had improved, disciplinary knowledge remained a weaker area of curriculum thinking in many schools.

## The Deep Dive Inspection Process

### What is a Deep Dive?

Under the Education Inspection Framework, inspectors conduct "deep dives" into specific subjects to gather evidence about curriculum intent, implementation, and impact. Geography may be selected for a deep dive in both primary and secondary schools, particularly where it is a subject of interest or concern.

A deep dive involves multiple activities:

**Top-level view**—inspectors begin by understanding leaders' overall vision for the subject and how curriculum decisions have been made.

**Document scrutiny**—inspectors examine curriculum documentation, including planning, progression maps, assessment information, and pupils' work.

**Lesson observations**—inspectors visit lessons to see the curriculum in action and how teachers bring intended learning to life.

**Discussions with stakeholders**—inspectors talk with subject leaders, teachers, and pupils to understand their experiences and perspectives on geography education.

**Work scrutiny**—inspectors examine pupils' books and assessments to evaluate what pupils are learning and how this compares with curriculum intentions.

### Key Questions for Subject Leaders

Subject leaders should be prepared to articulate:

**Intent:**
- What is the vision for geography in the school?
- How does the curriculum align with the national curriculum and go beyond it?
- How has content been selected and sequenced?
- What do pupils learn in each year, and how does this build over time?
- How does the curriculum address the breadth of geography (place, physical, human, skills)?

**Implementation:**
- How is the curriculum translated into classroom practice?
- What pedagogical approaches are used, and why?
- How are geographical skills, including fieldwork, taught?
- How is disciplinary knowledge developed alongside substantive content?
- What support is provided for non-specialist teachers?

**Impact:**
- How do you know pupils are learning what is intended?
- What does pupils' work reveal about their geographical understanding?
- How do pupils talk about their geography learning?
- What do assessment and monitoring reveal about curriculum effectiveness?
- How well are pupils prepared for the next stage of their geographical education?

## Implications for Curriculum Development

### From Intent to Implementation

The Ofsted documents emphasise that good intentions must be realised in classroom practice. Subject leaders need to ensure that:

**Planning translates into teaching**—curriculum documentation should guide but not replace thoughtful teaching. Teachers need to understand not just what to teach but why and how.

**Pedagogy serves the curriculum**—teaching methods should be selected because they effectively enable pupils to learn geographical content, not because they are fashionable or familiar.

**Assessment informs teaching**—assessment should reveal what pupils have learned and inform subsequent teaching decisions, rather than simply generating data.

### Addressing the Primary-Secondary Transition

Ofsted has identified the primary-secondary transition as a particular challenge for geography. Primary and secondary schools can address this by:

**Improving communication**—primary and secondary teachers should understand each other's curricula and expectations, ensuring that primary geography prepares pupils effectively for secondary study.

**Developing subject knowledge**—primary teachers, who are typically non-specialists, benefit from subject-specific professional development that builds their confidence and capability in teaching geography.

**Monitoring progression**—schools should track pupils' geographical learning across the transition, identifying and addressing gaps or redundancies.

### Fieldwork and Practical Geography

The Ofsted reports consistently identify fieldwork as an area requiring attention. Effective fieldwork:

**Is integral to the curriculum**—not an add-on or treat, but an essential component of geographical education that develops both substantive and disciplinary knowledge.

**Builds progressively**—pupils should engage with increasingly sophisticated fieldwork from the early years through to sixth form, developing their skills and independence over time.

**Involves genuine investigation**—fieldwork should involve pupils in collecting, analysing, and presenting data to answer geographical questions, not simply visiting places.

**Uses the local environment**—effective fieldwork often begins with the school grounds and local area, using these familiar contexts to develop skills before applying them elsewhere.

## Addressing Common Weaknesses

### Ensuring Breadth and Balance

Some curricula over-emphasise certain aspects of geography at the expense of others. Subject leaders should audit their curricula to ensure appropriate coverage of:

- **Place knowledge**—locational knowledge of the UK, Europe, and the wider world
- **Physical geography**—processes and patterns in the natural environment
- **Human geography**—human processes, settlements, economic activity, and development
- **Environmental geography**—sustainability, environmental change, and human-environment interactions
- **Geographical skills**—mapwork, fieldwork, GIS, and data handling

### Building Knowledge Across Topics

To address the common finding that topics exist in isolation, subject leaders should:

**Identify vertical threads**—themes or concepts that recur across multiple topics, such as sustainability, development, or spatial inequality, allowing pupils to make connections and deepen understanding over time.

**Plan for retrieval**—intentionally revisit prior learning, ensuring that knowledge from earlier topics is available for use in subsequent learning.

**Make connections explicit**—teach pupils how different geographical topics relate to each other, modelling the interconnected nature of the subject.

### Supporting Non-Specialist Teachers

Particularly in primary schools, geography is often taught by non-specialists who may lack confidence in the subject. Subject leaders can support these teachers by:

**Providing clear guidance**—accessible curriculum documentation that explains not just what to teach but the geographical thinking behind it.

**Developing subject knowledge**—professional development that builds teachers' own geographical understanding alongside their pedagogical skills.

**Offering resources**—high-quality resources, including maps, images, and data, that support effective teaching without requiring extensive preparation time.

**Modelling practice**—opportunities to observe effective geography teaching and discuss approaches with colleagues.

## Ofsted's Recommendations for Improvement

### For School Leaders

The 2023 subject report made several recommendations for school leaders:

**Support subject leaders**—ensure that geography subject leaders have the time, training, and authority to lead the subject effectively. This includes developing their understanding of curriculum concepts and how these shape a school's curriculum.

**Address time allocation**—review the time given to geography, particularly in primary schools, ensuring it is sufficient to achieve ambitious curriculum goals.

**Protect curriculum integrity**—when geography is combined with other subjects in topics, ensure that geographical learning is not diluted or marginalised.

**Invest in professional development**—provide subject-specific CPD for areas such as GIS, fieldwork, and teaching procedural knowledge.

### For Primary ITE Providers

The report specifically identified initial teacher education for primary teachers as an area for improvement:

**Increase geography training**—primary trainees currently spend limited time learning how to teach geography. ITE providers should ensure trainees have adequate time to develop subject knowledge and pedagogical understanding.

**Address misconceptions**—training should help primary teachers understand common geographical misconceptions that pupils hold and how to address them.

**Build confidence**—many primary teachers lack confidence in teaching geography. ITE should address this through practical, engaging experiences of the subject.

### For Curriculum Developers

**Resist exam specifications as ceilings**—at Key Stage 4 and 5, curricula should be designed to develop full geographical understanding, not merely to cover exam content.

**Prioritise Key Stage 3**—invest in developing a strong Key Stage 3 curriculum that builds on primary foundations and prepares pupils effectively for GCSE.

**Develop disciplinary knowledge**—ensure curricula explicitly teach how geographical knowledge is created and contested, not just what geographers know.

## Conclusion

Ofsted's research review and subject report provide valuable guidance for geography educators seeking to develop high-quality provision. The key messages are clear: geography education should be ambitious, covering the full breadth of the subject; curricula should build knowledge coherently both within and across topics; and geographical education should develop both substantive knowledge and disciplinary understanding of how that knowledge is created.

The deep dive process under the EIF brings these expectations into sharp focus, requiring subject leaders to articulate their curriculum intent clearly and demonstrate how this is realised in classroom practice. Schools that engage seriously with Ofsted's findings and recommendations are well-positioned to provide geography education that equips pupils to understand and engage with our complex, changing world.

Importantly, Ofsted consistently emphasises that there is no single correct way to deliver high-quality geography education. The research review and subject report identify common features of effective practice while recognising that contexts vary and schools must make decisions appropriate to their circumstances. The goal is not to replicate a particular model but to engage thoughtfully with the principles that underpin excellent geography education.
