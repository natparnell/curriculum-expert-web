# Royal Geographical Society (with IBG)

## Overview and Mission

The Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers), commonly abbreviated as RGS-IBG, is the United Kingdom's leading learned society and professional body for geography. Founded in 1830 as the Geographical Society of London, its core purpose remains the advancement of geographical science. The Society absorbed the older African Association (founded by Sir Joseph Banks in 1788), the Raleigh Club, and the Palestine Association before merging with the Institute of British Geographers in January 1995 to become the Royal Geographical Society (with IBG).

The merger created the largest and most vigorous geographical society in Europe, combining the RGS's traditional focus on exploration and fieldwork with the IBG's academic research strengths. Today, the Society has approximately 16,000 Fellows and Members and continues to champion geography through research funding, educational programmes, public engagement, and professional support.

The Society's headquarters are located in South Kensington, London, adjacent to the Royal Albert Hall. Its building houses extensive collections, including maps, photographs, manuscripts, and artefacts from nearly two centuries of geographical exploration and research.

## Educational Role and School Engagement

The RGS-IBG is deeply committed to promoting the relevance and benefits of geography in education. The Society provides extensive resources, professional development opportunities, and guidance to support geography teachers across all key stages. Its education work is guided by the principle that geography is essential for understanding the world in which we live and for developing informed, responsible global citizens.

### Geography in Schools Strategy

The Society's schools strategy focuses on several interconnected aims:

- **Promoting geography's value** — Reinforcing the relevance of geographical knowledge and skills in the modern world
- **Supporting teachers** — Providing high-quality teaching resources, CPD opportunities, and professional networks
- **Engaging students** — Offering fieldwork opportunities, careers guidance, and enrichment activities
- **Developing fieldwork capacity** — Ensuring all students have access to meaningful geographical field experiences
- **Advancing pedagogy** — Supporting innovation in geographical teaching and learning

The Society works closely with partner organisations including Esri UK (supporting GIS education), Ordnance Survey (advancing geospatial understanding), and the Geographical Association to maximise its impact in schools.

## Teaching Resources

The RGS-IBG provides an extensive catalogue of award-winning teaching resources designed to support geographical learning in the classroom and in the field. These resources are developed by experienced teachers and geographers, ensuring they are educationally sound, up-to-date, and engaging for students.

### Resource Categories

The Society's resources cover a comprehensive range of geographical topics and are organised to support teaching across all key stages:

- **Key Stage Two (ages 7-11)** — Resources introducing core geographical concepts, local area studies, and beginning fieldwork skills
- **Key Stage Three (ages 11-14)** — Materials supporting the transition to secondary geography and building foundational knowledge
- **Key Stage Four/GCSE (ages 14-16)** — Extensive resources aligned to all major examination specifications
- **Key Stage Five/A Level (ages 16-18)** — Advanced materials supporting independent investigation and synoptic assessment

### Geography at Home

The Geography at Home initiative provides resource modules spanning Key Stages Two to Five, designed for students to work through at home with parents and carers. Each module provides:

- Background information about the geographical topic
- Structured lesson plans with clear learning objectives
- All necessary resources and activity materials
- Extension activities for deeper exploration
- Links to real-world geographical issues and current affairs

These resources proved particularly valuable during periods of remote learning and continue to support homework, independent study, and parent engagement with geographical education.

- Background context and geographical significance
- Key data and statistics
- Multiple perspectives on the issue
- Discussion questions and activities
- Links to curriculum specifications
