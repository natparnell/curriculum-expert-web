# The Geographical Association (GA)

## Overview and Purpose

The **Geographical Association (GA)** is the leading subject association for geography education in the United Kingdom. Founded in **1893** by five geographers including the renowned **Sir Halford John Mackinder**, the GA has served for over 130 years as the primary professional body supporting geography teachers, teacher educators, academics, and students across all phases of education from Early Years to Post-16.

The organisation's stated purpose is **"improving geographical knowledge of the public through promoting geographical education."** Today, the GA represents approximately **10,000 members** including individual teachers, schools, universities, and institutions across more than 60 countries worldwide. While UK-based, the association maintains strong international links with geographical organisations in the USA, Australia, and Europe.

### Historical Context

The GA emerged during a pivotal period in the development of geography as an academic discipline. Sir Halford Mackinder, one of its founding members, was instrumental in establishing geography's credibility both as a university subject and as an essential component of school education. The association began as an informal gathering of educators sharing lantern slides—a cutting-edge visual technology of the era—before evolving into a formal professional body.

In **2010**, the GA incorporated under the Companies Act 2006 as a private company limited by guarantee and received charitable status (registration number 1135148). This structural change enabled the association to purchase its Sheffield headquarters, securing a permanent base for its operations after occupying the site since 1997.

## Organisational Structure

### Governance

The GA operates under the oversight of a **Governing Body** comprising 14 Directors who serve as both company members and charity Trustees. Members of the Governing Body are appointed through election procedures outlined in the association's By-laws, with the body having the power to co-opt up to three additional individuals to fill specialist roles.

### Leadership

The association is currently led by:
- **Chief Executive:** Steve Brace
- **President:** Hina Robinson (2024-2025)

The GA headquarters in **Sheffield** houses a professional staff team providing day-to-day services and strategic leadership under the Chief Executive's direction.

### Regional Network

A distinctive feature of the GA's structure is its network of **41 affiliated regional branches**. Each branch operates with an autonomous constitution while maintaining alignment with national priorities. These branches deliver:
- Post-16 lectures for students, teachers, and the general public
- Regional professional development programmes
- **Worldwise** geography quiz competitions
- Local networking and support opportunities

### Phase Committees and Special Interest Groups

The GA's Education Group oversees policy formulation through various committees and special interest groups focusing on specific phases (primary, secondary, post-16) and thematic areas of geography education. This structure ensures that member expertise informs the association's strategic priorities and resource development.

## Professional Journals

The GA publishes three **termly professional journals**, each targeting a distinct educational phase and audience. These publications represent a cornerstone of membership benefits and serve as vital channels for disseminating research, practical teaching ideas, and policy developments.

## Curriculum Making: The GA's Distinctive Approach

Perhaps the most significant conceptual contribution of the Geographical Association to geography education is its theory of **"curriculum making."** This framework, developed through the work of **David Lambert** (former GA Chief Executive) and colleagues, provides a sophisticated yet practical approach to curriculum development.

### Defining Curriculum Making

The GA defines curriculum making as:

> "The creative act of interpreting a national curriculum or examination specification and turning it into a coherent, challenging and engaging sequence of teaching and learning."

Crucially, curriculum making is distinguished from curriculum design, development, or planning—activities that need not involve teachers directly. **Curriculum making is what teachers do** in classrooms every day.

### The Three Ingredients

Effective curriculum making requires teachers to hold three elements in dynamic balance:

1. **The discipline of geography** – its key ideas, concepts, and purposes
2. **Subject-specialist teaching techniques** – pedagogical approaches that work for geography
3. **Their students** – understanding learners, their prior knowledge, and how they engage with geographical content

The teacher's role is to interpret and synthesise these elements, creating educational encounters that bring geography alive for learners.

### The Curriculum Making Triangle

The GA represents curriculum making visually through a triangle diagram (often called the **subject didactic triangle**), with three corners representing:
- **Curriculum content** (what geography to teach)
- **The teacher** (professional knowledge and choices)
- **The pupils** (learners and their needs)

Effective curriculum making occurs at the centre of this triangle, where teachers make professional decisions about content within curriculum frameworks while adapting their teaching to the specific pupils in their classrooms.

### The Power of Artefacts

A key insight from the GA's curriculum making work concerns the **"power of a well-chosen artefact."** Memorable geography lessons often centre on compelling resources—video clips, photographs, data sets, literary extracts, first-hand accounts, or iconic diagrams—that serve as "linchpins" for learning sequences.

The distinction between a generic curriculum resource and a **curriculum artefact** lies in the significance invested by the curriculum maker and the purpose behind its use. The word "artefact" derives from the Latin *arte factum* ("skilfully made"), emphasising the craft involved in deploying resources effectively.

### GeoCapabilities and Curriculum Leadership

The GA's curriculum making approach connects to international research on **GeoCapabilities**—the idea that geography education contributes to human capability development by enabling students to:
- Think beyond their immediate experience
- Engage with alternative perspectives
- Imagine different futures
- Participate effectively in a complex world

This capabilities approach positions geography teachers as **curriculum leaders** who make professional decisions about what geographical knowledge is worth teaching and why.

## Teaching Resources and Publications

Beyond journals, the GA produces an extensive range of **teaching resources and guidance materials** spanning all educational phases.

### Resource Categories

| Resource Type | Target Audience | Content |

## The Geography Quality Mark

The **Geography Quality Mark (GQM)** scheme offers schools and geography departments recognition for quality, progress, and creative thinking in geography leadership, curriculum development, learning, and teaching.

### Award Structure

The GQM operates at three levels:
- **Bronze** – Establishing foundations for quality geography
- **Silver** – Developing and embedding good practice
- **Gold** – Demonstrating excellence and innovation

Schools achieving Gold may apply for recognition as a **Centre of Excellence**, signalling outstanding geography provision.

### Self-Assessment Framework

The scheme employs a **self-assessment framework** encouraging departments to:
- Evaluate their current provision systematically
- Identify priorities for development
- Gather evidence of practice and pupil outcomes
- Submit documentation for external scrutiny

Evidence suggests that schools using the GQM framework find it a **"powerful and enabling tool for curriculum development"** regardless of whether they ultimately pursue formal accreditation.

## Worldwise Programme

The **Worldwise** initiative engages students directly with geography through competitive and collaborative activities:

- **Local and online geography quizzes** testing knowledge and understanding
- **Photography competitions** encouraging geographical observation
- **Essay competitions** developing extended writing and argumentation
- **Fieldwork challenge weekends** providing immersive experiences

Worldwise activities connect classroom learning to real-world geographical engagement, raising the profile of the subject among students and celebrating geographical achievement.

## Policy Engagement and Advocacy

The GA serves as the **voice of geography education** in policy discussions, actively engaging with government to promote the subject's interests.
