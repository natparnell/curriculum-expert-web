# Textbook Analysis and Evaluation

## Introduction: The Role of Textbooks in Geography Education

Textbooks remain a cornerstone of geography education in English schools, serving multiple functions beyond mere content delivery. According to Ofsted's geography research review (2021), high-quality curriculum resources, including textbooks, play a vital role in supporting teachers—particularly non-specialists—to deliver coherent geographical education. This document provides a comprehensive framework for analysing and evaluating geography textbooks, ensuring they align with curriculum intentions, pedagogical approaches, and principles of equitable representation.

The evaluation of geography textbooks requires attention to disciplinary rigour, pedagogical support, progression across key stages, and increasingly, critical examination of whose voices and perspectives are represented. The Geographical Association (GA) emphasises that textbook selection should be driven by curriculum needs rather than convenience or habit, with careful consideration given to how resources support the development of both substantive and disciplinary geographical knowledge.

## Section 1: Foundational Evaluation Criteria

### 1.1 Curriculum Alignment and Specification Coverage

The primary criterion for textbook evaluation is alignment with the intended curriculum. This involves examining whether the textbook content maps coherently onto the National Curriculum programmes of study and, at Key Stage 4, the chosen examination specification.

**National Curriculum Coverage (KS1-3)**

The geography National Curriculum (2014) specifies core knowledge requirements across four key stages. Effective textbooks should:

- Address all statutory requirements for the relevant key stage without significant omissions
- Provide appropriate depth of coverage for each topic, avoiding superficial treatment of complex geographical concepts
- Locate content within the broader framework of geographical learning, making connections to prior and subsequent learning explicit
- Support the development of locational knowledge, place knowledge, human and physical geography understanding, and geographical skills and fieldwork

The Ofsted research review (2021) notes that many geography curricula suffer from coverage that is "a mile wide and an inch deep." Textbooks that attempt to cover too many topics at the expense of depth should be viewed critically. David Gardner and colleagues, in their work on curriculum planning for the GA, advocate for textbooks that enable "fewer topics in greater depth" rather than comprehensive but shallow coverage.

**GCSE Specification Alignment (KS4)**

For GCSE geography, textbooks must align precisely with the chosen examination board specification (AQA, Edexcel, OCR, or Eduqas). Evaluation should consider:

- Whether the textbook corresponds to the specific specification (A or B for AQA/Edexcel) being followed
- Coverage of all mandatory topics and optional units where applicable
- Integration of required geographical skills throughout content chapters
- Support for fieldwork requirements and the independent investigation at A Level
- Attention to the assessment objectives (AO1-AO4) and their weighting in final assessments

The examination boards provide approved textbook lists, and while approval does not guarantee quality, it does indicate basic specification coverage. Teachers should verify that content corresponds to current specifications, as geography specifications underwent significant reform in 2016 and remain subject to periodic review.

### 1.2 Substantive and Disciplinary Knowledge Balance

Ofsted's geography research review (2021) distinguishes between substantive knowledge (the content of geography—facts, concepts, and procedures) and disciplinary knowledge (how geographical knowledge is created, contested, and verified). Quality geography textbooks should address both dimensions.

**Substantive Knowledge**

Evaluation of substantive content should examine:

- **Accuracy and currency**: Factual information should be accurate and up-to-date, with attention to changing contexts (e.g., population figures, development indicators, climate data)
- **Conceptual development**: Core geographical concepts (space, place, scale, interdependence, sustainability) should be developed progressively and explicitly
- **Breadth and depth**: Coverage should balance overview knowledge with opportunities for deeper investigation of case studies
- **Case study selection**: Cases should be geographically diverse, contemporary where appropriate, and selected for their capacity to illuminate broader principles rather than isolated factual learning

**Disciplinary Knowledge**

The research review emphasises that pupils should understand "where geographical knowledge originates, and how they can learn the practices of geographers." Textbooks supporting this aim should:

- Explain how geographical data is collected, analysed, and interpreted
- Introduce geographical theories and models as contested interpretations rather than fixed facts
- Include examples of geographical enquiry and investigation
- Develop understanding of different geographical perspectives and the reasons for disagreement within the discipline
- Support the development of cartographic, graphical, and statistical literacy

Textbooks that present geographical knowledge as static and uncontested fail to develop pupils' disciplinary understanding. The GA's curriculum framework encourages resources that "enable pupils to think geographically" rather than simply absorb geographical information.

### 1.3 Progression and Cognitive Demand

Effective textbooks structure learning to support progression in geographical understanding and skills. Evaluation should examine:

**Vertical Progression**

- Content should build systematically from foundational concepts to more complex understanding
- Prior learning should be activated and connected to new content
- Expectations should increase appropriately across key stages and year groups
- Connections between topics should be made explicit, supporting pupils to develop holistic geographical understanding

The concept of "vertical coherence" through threads or themes, as implemented in the Oak National Academy geography curriculum, provides a useful model. Textbooks that return to key concepts at increasing levels of sophistication support deeper learning than those treating topics as discrete units.

**Cognitive Demand**

- Tasks and questions should require increasingly sophisticated thinking
- Text should move from concrete description to abstract conceptualisation where appropriate
- Opportunities for extended writing, analysis, and evaluation should increase through key stages
- Differentiation strategies should support access for all pupils without capping ambition

Mary Myatt's work on curriculum coherence emphasises that textbooks should support pupils' capacity to engage with "lively, demanding, and important" geographical questions rather than simplifying content to the point of triviality.

## Section 2: Pedagogical Features and Support

### 2.1 Enquiry-Based Learning Support

The GA advocates for enquiry-based approaches to geography teaching, and textbooks should support rather than constrain this pedagogy. Evaluation criteria include:

**Question-Driven Structure**

Quality geography textbooks frame learning around enquiry questions that:

- Are genuinely geographical (addressing space, place, environment, or sustainability)
- Are open-ended rather than closed factual recall
- Engage pupils' curiosity and connect to their lived experience
- Require synthesis of knowledge and application of skills to answer

Textbooks dominated by declarative statements and closed questions encourage passive reception rather than active geographical thinking.

**Investigation Support**

Effective textbooks provide:

- Guidance for fieldwork and practical geographical investigation
- Examples of geographical enquiry that model disciplinary practices
- Data sources and datasets that pupils can analyse and interpret
- Opportunities for pupils to formulate their own questions and investigations

The Ofsted subject report "Getting Our Bearings" (2023) found that fieldwork and practical enquiry were weaknesses in many schools; textbooks that support these aspects of geography are particularly valuable.

### 2.2 Assessment and Progress Monitoring

Textbooks increasingly include assessment materials, and these require careful evaluation:

**Formative Assessment**

- Questions and tasks should be embedded throughout content to check understanding
- Feedback mechanisms should help pupils identify and address misconceptions
- Progress checks should relate clearly to curriculum objectives
- Self-assessment opportunities should develop pupils' metacognitive awareness

**Summative Assessment**

- End-of-unit assessments should sample the full range of curriculum content and skills
- Question types should mirror those used in external examinations at appropriate key stages
- Mark schemes and success criteria should be transparent and rigorous
- Assessment should support spaced retrieval and interleaving of content

Gardner, Weeden, and Butt's work on assessing progress in Key Stage 3 geography (GA, 2015) provides a framework for evaluating textbook assessment materials against principles of valid and reliable geography assessment.

### 2.3 Teacher Support Materials

Accompanying teacher resources significantly impact textbook utility. Evaluation should consider:

- **Lesson planning support**: Clear guidance on using textbook content within well-structured lessons
- **Differentiation guidance**: Strategies for supporting pupils with different prior attainment and learning needs
- **Subject knowledge development**: Background information to support non-specialist or early-career teachers
- **Resource provision**: Additional materials (slides, worksheets, video links) that supplement the textbook
- **Assessment support**: Guidance on interpreting pupil responses and providing effective feedback

The Teachers' Standards require that assessment procedures be "rigorous and robust, supporting consistent and accurate judgements" (DfE ITT criteria, 2023). Textbook assessment materials should support teachers in meeting this requirement.

## Section 3: Representation, Diversity, and Decolonisation

### 3.1 Critical Examination of Textbook Content

Recent scholarship and professional discourse have highlighted significant concerns about representation in geography textbooks. The decolonising geography movement challenges educators to examine whose voices, perspectives, and knowledge systems are privileged in curriculum resources.

**Evaluating Representation**

Textbook analysis should critically examine:

- **Geographical focus**: Does content disproportionately focus on certain regions (typically the UK, Europe, and North America) at the expense of African, Asian, Latin American, and Pacific perspectives?
- **Agency and voice**: Are people in the Global South represented as passive recipients of development or as active agents shaping their own futures?
- **Complexity of contexts**: Does content avoid stereotypical representations of places (e.g., Africa as uniformly poor and conflict-ridden; the Caribbean as merely a tourist destination)?
- **Indigenous knowledge**: Are indigenous knowledge systems and geographical understandings acknowledged alongside academic geography?
- **Historical context**: Is colonial history addressed in explanations of contemporary geographical patterns?

Research by Hummer (2014) and colleagues has documented persistent patterns of biased representation in geography textbooks, with African contexts particularly subject to oversimplified and deficit-focused portrayals. Uhlenwinkel (2017) and UNESCO (2017) emphasise the importance of diverse identity representation for developing global citizenship.

### 3.2 Decolonising Geography Education

The Decolonising Geography network and associated resources provide frameworks for evaluating textbooks through a decolonial lens:

**Questions for Evaluation**

- Does the textbook challenge or reproduce colonial ways of seeing the world?
- Are maps and spatial representations examined critically for the perspectives they embed?
- Is the history of geographical knowledge production acknowledged (including its colonial roots)?
- Do case studies and examples disrupt or reinforce colonial narratives about development, progress, and modernity?
- Are diverse epistemologies (ways of knowing) represented, or is Western scientific rationality presented as the only valid approach?

Peak (2024) demonstrates that decolonisation can be addressed across the geography curriculum, including in topics like plate tectonics and hazards that might appear culturally neutral. Textbooks that treat such topics purely through technical lenses miss opportunities to develop critical geographical consciousness.

### 3.3 Cultural Diversity and Inclusion

Beyond decolonisation, textbooks should reflect the cultural diversity of contemporary Britain and the wider world:

- **Inclusive imagery**: Visual materials should represent diverse people in varied roles and contexts
- **Multiple perspectives**: Controversial geographical issues (climate change, migration, development) should be presented through multiple lenses
- **Language and terminology**: Content should use respectful, person-centred language and avoid deficit terminology
- **Accessibility**: Physical design (font, layout, contrast) and language complexity should support pupils with additional needs

The GA's guidance on cultural diversity in geography education (2024) provides practical support for evaluating resources against principles of inclusive representation.

## Section 4: Practical Evaluation Frameworks

### 4.1 Systematic Textbook Review Process

Schools and departments should adopt systematic approaches to textbook evaluation:

**Phase 1: Pre-Evaluation**

1. Clarify curriculum requirements (National Curriculum, specification, departmental scheme of work)
2. Identify specific needs (pupil population, teacher expertise, resource constraints)
3. Establish evaluation team (including geography specialists and, where possible, pupils)
4. Develop evaluation criteria weighted to departmental priorities

**Phase 2: Desk Review**

1. Map textbook content against curriculum requirements
2. Examine progression and coherence
3. Review pedagogical features and support materials
4. Analyse representation and diversity
5. Check currency and accuracy of information

**Phase 3: Classroom Trailing**

1. Use sample chapters with target year groups
2. Gather pupil feedback on accessibility and engagement
3. Evaluate teacher usability and support needs
4. Assess integration with existing resources and approaches

**Phase 4: Decision and Monitoring**

1. Compare evaluated options against criteria
2. Make selection decision with rationale
3. Plan implementation including teacher development
4. Establish review timeline for ongoing evaluation

### 4.2 Evaluation Checklist

### 4.3 Publisher Evaluation and Approval Processes

Understanding publisher processes informs textbook evaluation:

**GA Publishers' Award**

The Geographical Association recognises quality geography resources through its annual Publishers' Award. Textbooks receiving this award (such as Hachette's "Progress in Geography" series, highly commended in 2025) have been evaluated by geography education experts against criteria of curriculum value, geographical accuracy, and pedagogical effectiveness.

**Examination Board Approval**

GCSE and A Level textbooks may be "approved" by examination boards, indicating alignment with specification requirements. However, approval does not indicate pedagogical quality or currency, and schools should not rely solely on approval status when selecting resources.

## Section 5: Key Stage Transitions and Coherence

### 5.1 KS2 to KS3 Transition

The transition from primary to secondary geography presents particular textbook considerations:

**Building on KS2 Foundations**

The KS2 National Curriculum establishes foundations in locational knowledge, place knowledge, and basic geographical skills. Effective KS3 textbooks should:

- Acknowledge and activate prior KS2 learning without unnecessary repetition
- Address gaps in KS2 coverage that may exist due to curriculum variability
- Raise cognitive demand appropriately for Year 7 pupils
- Support teachers who may be uncertain about pupils' primary geography experience

Ofsted's review of geography in outstanding primary schools (2021) noted significant variation in primary geography provision. KS3 textbooks that assume common prior experience may disadvantage pupils from schools with weaker geography provision.

### 5.2 KS3 to GCSE Coherence

The relationship between KS3 and GCSE geography has been problematic, with the Ofsted subject report (2023) finding that many KS3 curricula were dominated by GCSE preparation at the expense of broader geographical education.

**Evaluation Criteria for KS3-GCSE Coherence**

- KS3 textbooks should develop foundational understanding without being constrained by GCSE content
- Case studies at KS3 should be selected for educational value rather than GCSE overlap
- Skills development should be continuous from KS3 into KS4
- GCSE textbooks should acknowledge and build upon KS3 foundations

The Oak National Academy's KS3-4 curriculum demonstrates vertical coherence through conceptual threads that develop across key stages. Textbooks supporting such approaches contribute to more coherent pupil experience than those treating KS3 and GCSE as disconnected courses.

### 5.3 Managing Multiple Textbook Series

Schools often use different textbooks for different key stages or ability groups, requiring evaluation of coherence across resources:

- Do approaches to key concepts remain consistent or contradictory?
- Is there unnecessary repetition or problematic gaps?
- Do assessment approaches align sufficiently for progress tracking?
- Can teachers and pupils navigate between resources effectively?

## Section 6: Digital and Supplementary Resources

### 6.1 Digital Textbook Features

Many contemporary textbooks are available in digital formats with additional features:

**Evaluation of Digital Elements**

- **Interactivity**: Do interactive elements enhance learning or provide mere distraction?
- **Accessibility**: Can digital content be accessed on school devices? Are offline options available?
- **Integration**: Does digital content complement or duplicate print materials?
- **Updates**: Can digital content be updated for currency? At what cost?
- **Data**: What pupil data is collected and how is it used?

The GA notes that digital resources should be evaluated against the same criteria as print materials, with additional attention to technical functionality and data protection.

### 6.2 Supplementary Resource Ecosystems

Major textbook series often come with extensive supplementary materials:

**Evaluation Considerations**

- Are supplementary materials genuinely additional or necessary for effective use?
- Do they reduce teacher workload or add complexity?
- Is there coherence between core textbook and supplementary resources?
- Are costs sustainable over the planned adoption period?

Schools should be wary of textbook schemes that require extensive supplementary purchases to be fully functional, particularly where core materials lack essential content or support.

## Section 7: Common Pitfalls and Misconceptions

### 7.1 Textbook Misconceptions Among Teachers

**Misconception 1: "Approved" Means High Quality**

Examination board approval indicates alignment with specification requirements, not pedagogical quality, accuracy, or currency. Approved textbooks require the same critical evaluation as non-approved alternatives.

**Misconception 2: Comprehensive Coverage Equals Better Curriculum**

Textbooks offering extensive topic lists may sacrifice depth for breadth. Ofsted (2021) criticised curricula that were "a mile wide and an inch deep." Quality textbooks focus on fewer topics developed with appropriate depth.

**Misconception 3: Textbooks Should Be Followed Exactly**

Textbooks are resources to support curriculum implementation, not prescribed curricula themselves. Effective departments adapt and supplement textbook content to
