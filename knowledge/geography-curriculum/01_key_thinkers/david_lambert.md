# David Lambert

## Biography

David Lambert is Emeritus Professor of Geography Education at UCL Institute of Education (IOE), University College London, and one of the most influential geography educators of his generation. His career spans five decades, bridging the worlds of school teaching, teacher education, academic research, and professional leadership through the Geographical Association.

### Early Career and Teaching (1973–1986)

Lambert began his academic journey with a BA from the University of Newcastle in 1973, followed by postgraduate professional training (PGCE) at the University of Cambridge. He spent twelve years as a comprehensive school geography teacher, a foundational experience that would deeply shape his later theoretical work. During this period, he also became Deputy Headteacher in 1985, gaining valuable senior leadership experience within schools.

While teaching, Lambert wrote award-winning school textbooks, establishing himself as a significant curriculum developer before transitioning into higher education. This dual identity as both practitioner and curriculum theorist would become a hallmark of his career.

### Transition to Teacher Education (1986–1998)

In 1986–87, Lambert joined the Institute of Education (now UCL IOE) as a teacher educator, following in the footsteps of influential figures such as Norman Graves and Frances Slater who had established the IOE as a centre for geography education research. Lambert's work at the IOE developed Norman Graves's innovative approach to "rational curriculum planning," building on the theoretical foundations laid in the 1970s and 1980s.

He was promoted to Reader in Education in 1999 and later to Professor of Geography Education. He also served as Assistant Dean for Initial Teacher Education (Research), reflecting his institutional leadership within teacher education.

### Geographical Association Chief Executive (1998–2008)

Lambert served as Chief Executive of the Geographical Association from 1998 to 2008, a transformative decade for geography education in England. During his tenure, he oversaw the GA's response to significant curriculum changes and established the Association as a key voice in national curriculum debates. His leadership period coincided with the introduction of the National Curriculum for Geography in 1991 and its subsequent revisions, positioning the GA as a critical friend to government while supporting classroom teachers through periods of reform.

### Return to Academia and International Work (2008–present)

After stepping down as GA Chief Executive, Lambert returned to full-time academic work at the IOE, where he continued to develop his theoretical contributions to geography education. He has held visiting professorships and developed international collaborations, most notably through the GeoCapabilities project.

Lambert has supervised numerous doctoral students and contributed to the development of geography education research communities internationally. He now holds the title of Emeritus Professor of Geography Education at UCL IOE.

## Key Ideas and Contributions

### 1. The GeoCapabilities Approach

Lambert's most significant theoretical contribution is the **GeoCapabilities approach**, developed through an international research project (2013–2017) funded by the European Union's Comenius programme, with additional pilot work supported by the American Association of Geographers.

**Core Principles:**

- **Capabilities Approach to Education:** Drawing on the work of economist Amartya Sen and philosopher Martha Nussbaum, Lambert applies a capabilities framework to geography education. This approach considers how individuals can develop the potential to lead lives they have reason to value.

- **Thinking Geographically:** The GeoCapabilities approach argues that students develop greater life capabilities when they acquire geographical knowledge that enables them to "think geographically"—to understand spatial relationships, environmental processes, and human-environment interactions in sophisticated ways.

- **Powerful Disciplinary Knowledge (PDK):** At the heart of GeoCapabilities is the concept of "powerful disciplinary knowledge"—the distinctive forms of understanding that geography as a discipline offers, which are not available through everyday experience or common sense.

- **Teachers as Curriculum Leaders:** The project creates teacher education materials designed to develop teachers as curriculum leaders who can articulate the value of geographical education and make informed curriculum decisions.

### 2. Powerful Knowledge

Lambert has been a leading advocate for **Michael Young's concept of "powerful knowledge"** in the context of geography education. Working closely with Young and colleagues at the IOE, Lambert has argued for a curriculum based on:

- **Disciplinary distinctiveness:** The unique ways of thinking that geography offers, including spatial thinking, understanding of place, environmental perspectives, and the ability to work across scales from local to global.

- **Specialised knowledge:** Knowledge that is systematically developed by academic communities and is not accessible through everyday experience alone.

- **Future orientation:** Knowledge that opens possibilities for students, enabling them to understand and engage with a changing world.

Lambert distinguishes between "knowledge of the powerful" (the status quo, often used to maintain social hierarchies) and "powerful knowledge" (knowledge that empowers learners). Geography education, he argues, should provide access to powerful disciplinary knowledge that enables students to understand and potentially transform their worlds.

### 3. Curriculum vs Pedagogy Distinction

One of Lambert's most influential contributions to professional discourse has been his insistence on **distinguishing curriculum from pedagogy**—a distinction that has significant implications for how teachers understand their role.

**Curriculum** refers to:
- What knowledge is selected for students to learn
- The sequencing and progression of that knowledge
- The substantive and disciplinary concepts that structure the subject
- The overall architecture of students' educational experience

**Pedagogy** refers to:
- How that knowledge is taught
- Teaching methods, strategies, and classroom techniques
- The craft of engaging students with content
- The relational aspects of teaching and learning

Lambert argues that while pedagogy is important, the curriculum question—**"what should students learn and why?"**—is logically prior and too often neglected. This argument has gained significant traction in England, particularly following Ofsted's renewed emphasis on curriculum in the 2019 Education Inspection Framework.

### 4. Curriculum Making

Building on his work with the GA, Lambert has developed the concept of **"curriculum making"** as an active, creative process in which teachers interpret and enact curriculum frameworks. Rather than viewing curriculum as simply delivered or implemented, Lambert sees teachers as **curriculum makers** who:

- Make professional judgments about content selection and sequencing
- Adapt national requirements to local contexts and student needs
- Create coherent learning journeys through geographical content
- Engage with the "big ideas" of geography to design meaningful programmes of study

This approach positions teachers as professionals with expertise in both their subject and their students, rather than as technicians delivering predetermined content.

### 5. Conceptual Approaches to Geography Education

In his influential book *Teaching Geography 11-18: A Conceptual Approach* (2010), co-authored with John Morgan, Lambert argues for **curriculum planning founded on a set of major geographical concepts** including:

- **Place:** Understanding the distinctive characteristics of locations and how they are experienced and represented
- **Space:** Understanding spatial distributions, patterns, and relationships
- **Scale:** The ability to work across and move between different geographical scales
- **Sustainability:** Understanding environmental challenges and possibilities
- **Diversity:** Recognition and understanding of human and environmental diversity
- **Interdependence:** Understanding connections and relationships between places and processes

This conceptual approach moves beyond topic-based curriculum planning toward designing learning that develops deep geographical understanding.

## Legacy and Current Relevance

David Lambert's work continues to shape geography education in several ways:

1. **Curriculum Renaissance:** His advocacy for serious curriculum thinking has contributed to what many see as a "curriculum renaissance" in English schools, with increasing attention to what is taught and why, not just how it is taught.

2. **International Impact:** The GeoCapabilities project has created an international network of geography educators applying capabilities approaches in diverse national contexts.

3. **Teacher Professionalism:** His work on curriculum making positions teachers as knowledgeable professionals whose judgments about content and sequencing matter.

4. **Social Justice:** Through his work on powerful knowledge and capabilities, Lambert provides a rationale for geography education that emphasises social justice and the empowerment of learners.

5. **Research-Practice Links:** Throughout his career, Lambert has maintained connections between research and practice, ensuring that theoretical developments inform classroom practice and that classroom realities shape research agendas.

Lambert remains an active voice in geography education through his writing, conference presentations, and engagement with professional communities. His influence on how geography educators think about curriculum, knowledge, and teacher professionalism is likely to endure for decades to come.
