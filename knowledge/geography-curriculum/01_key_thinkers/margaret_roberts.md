## Biography

### Early Teaching Career

Margaret Roberts began her teaching career in comprehensive schools in London and Leicestershire before moving to Sheffield, where she continued classroom practice while developing her ideas about geography education. During this period, she gained firsthand experience of the challenges and opportunities facing geography teachers in comprehensive schools—experience that would deeply inform her later work in teacher education.

In a unique twist to her career, Roberts retrained as a mathematics teacher after completing A-Level mathematics, doing teaching practice with bottom-set maths students in Sheffield comprehensive schools. This experience gave her valuable insights into numeracy across the curriculum and alternative pedagogical approaches.

### University of Sheffield and Teacher Education (1982–2006)

In 1982, Roberts joined the University of Sheffield's Division of Education, where she would spend nearly 25 years transforming geography teacher education. She coordinated the Geography PGCE course from 1982 until her retirement in 2006—one of the longest and most influential tenures in UK geography initial teacher education.

During her time at Sheffield, Roberts directly influenced a generation of geography teachers not only in Sheffield but across the United Kingdom and beyond. Her approach to teacher education emphasized:

- The inseparability of curriculum and pedagogy
- The importance of subject-specialist knowledge
- Enquiry-based approaches to teaching and learning
- The development of critical, reflective practitioners

The University of Sheffield's PGCE geography course, under her leadership, became renowned for producing teachers who were both pedagogically skilled and deeply knowledgeable about geography as a discipline.

### Geographical Association Leadership

Roberts has been a central figure in the Geographical Association for several decades. She served as **President of the GA from 2008 to 2009**, following in the footsteps of influential predecessors and bringing her distinctive perspective on enquiry-based education to the Association's strategic direction.

Her GA involvement has extended far beyond her presidential year:

- Member of the Secondary School Committee
- Regular contributor to *Teaching Geography* journal
- Author of two of the GA's most influential publications
- Presenter at numerous GA conferences
- Mentor and advisor to successive generations of geography teachers

### Honours and Recognition

In the **2021 New Year's Honours List**, Margaret Roberts was appointed **Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE)** for services to education. This national recognition acknowledged her profound and sustained impact on geography education since at least the 1990s.

The Geographical Association noted that her influence had shaped "not just how geography is taught, but how teachers think about their role in the classroom."

### Post-Retirement Contributions

Following her retirement from the University of Sheffield in 2006, Roberts has remained an active and influential voice in geography education:

- Continues to publish regularly in *Teaching Geography* and academic journals
- Delivered the prestigious **Inaugural Presidential Lecture** at the 2017 GA Annual Conference
- Published a thoroughly revised and updated **second edition** of *Geography Through Enquiry* in 2023
- Maintains engagement with contemporary debates about powerful knowledge, curriculum, and pedagogy
- Active presence at GA events and through the GeogPod podcast (Episode #2, March 2020)

## Key Ideas and Contributions

### Enquiry-Based Geography Education

Roberts is the foremost authority on enquiry-based approaches to geography education in the UK. Her work represents a sustained, decades-long exploration of what it means to teach and learn geography through enquiry.

#### Core Principles

Roberts' conception of geographical enquiry rests on several interconnected principles:

1. **Questions Drive Learning**: Enquiry is fundamentally about asking questions—students pursuing their own geographical questions rather than simply answering teachers' predetermined ones.

2. **Evidence-Based Investigation**: Enquiries must be rooted in sources of geographical evidence, including both traditional data sources and the knowledge and ideas students bring to the classroom.

3. **Process and Content Are Inseparable**: Roberts consistently argues that "what students learn and how they learn are inextricably related." Curriculum cannot be separated from pedagogy, and how students learn profoundly influences what they learn.

4. **Teacher as Expert Guide**: Roberts rejects simplistic notions of the teacher as mere "facilitator" or "manager" of learning. In her view, the teacher remains a subject specialist whose expertise is essential for guiding students through sophisticated geographical enquiries.

5. **Metacognition and Reflection**: Students should be encouraged to reflect on both what they are learning and how they are learning it, developing geographical thinking alongside geographical knowledge.

#### The Enquiry Cycle

Roberts' work describes enquiry as a cyclical process rather than a linear sequence. The cycle typically includes:

- **Starting points**: Stimulating curiosity and generating questions
- **Planning**: Deciding how to investigate the questions
- **Data collection**: Gathering evidence from multiple sources
- **Processing and analysis**: Making sense of the evidence
- **Drawing conclusions**: Developing geographical arguments
- **Evaluation**: Reflecting on the enquiry process and outcomes
- **Application**: Using what has been learned to inform future enquiries

Crucially, Roberts emphasizes that "applying what has been learned to the next enquiry" completes the cycle and leads to deeper, more sophisticated understanding over time.

### Dialogic Teaching and Classroom Talk

Drawing on the work of Robin Alexander, Neil Mercer, and others, Roberts has been a strong advocate for dialogic teaching in geography education. Her work emphasizes:

- **The collective nature of learning**: Classrooms as sites of joint enquiry where teachers and students learn together
- **The importance of quality talk**: Moving beyond traditional question-answer routines to sustained, exploratory dialogue
- **Building on student contributions**: Cumulative classroom talk where ideas are developed and refined collaboratively
- **Purposeful discussion**: Talk that is structured with specific geographical learning goals in mind

Roberts (2023) identifies six characteristics of dialogic teaching in geography:

1. **Collective**: Addressing learning tasks together
2. **Supportive**: Expressing ideas freely without fear of judgment
3. **Reciprocal**: Listening to each other and considering alternative viewpoints
4. **Deliberative**: Discussing and resolving different points of view
5. **Cumulative**: Building on contributions to create coherent lines of thinking
6. **Purposeful**: Structured with specific geographical learning goals

### Powerful Pedagogies

In recent work, Roberts has engaged extensively with Michael Young's concept of "powerful knowledge" to consider what makes geography education truly powerful. Her article "Powerful pedagogies for the school geography curriculum" (*International Research in Geographical and Environmental Education*, 2022) argues that:

> "Geography is powerful if the curriculum includes the study of relevant issues, provides students with opportunities to debate them, and encourages dialogic talk."

This approach enables students to:
- Envisage alternatives to current geographical conditions
- Think critically about geographical concepts
- Move beyond "empty verbalism" through substantive discussion
- Participate in the construction of geographical knowledge
- Develop the confidence and capability for active citizenship

### Curriculum Making

Roberts is a proponent of "curriculum making"—the idea that teachers should be active creators of curriculum rather than mere implementers of prescribed content. This perspective:

- Empowers teachers to adapt and develop curriculum for their specific contexts
- Recognizes the professional expertise of geography teachers
- Encourages creative connections between geographical content, pedagogy, and student experience
- Supports teachers in navigating the complex relationship between national curriculum requirements and local needs
