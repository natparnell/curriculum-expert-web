# Rex Walford: Innovator in Geography Education

## Biographical Overview

Rex Ashley Walford OBE (14 February 1934 – 2 January 2011) was one of the most influential figures in British geography education during the post-war period. A University Lecturer in Geography and Education at the University of Cambridge from 1973 to 1999, Walford shaped the professional development of thousands of geography teachers through his innovative approaches to teacher education, his pioneering work on games and simulations in geography, and his enthusiastic advocacy for the subject. His influence extended far beyond Cambridge through his publications, his presidency of the Geographical Association, and his ongoing commitment to geography education after formal retirement.

Walford's career was characterised by intellectual curiosity, pedagogical innovation, and an infectious enthusiasm for both geography and education. He possessed a rare combination of academic rigour and practical classroom wisdom, enabling him to bridge the gap between educational theory and classroom practice. His work on games and simulations in geography teaching revolutionised pedagogical approaches, introducing active learning methods that engaged students through experiential learning and role-play.

Beyond geography education, Walford lived a remarkably full life. He was a professional musician, drama critic, theatre director, sports enthusiast, and collector who owned and rode a Harley Davidson motorcycle. This breadth of interests informed his educational philosophy—he believed that learning should be engaging, enjoyable, and connected to real human experiences. His zesty approach to life inspired generations of teachers who passed through his PGCE course at Cambridge.

## Early Life and Education

Rex Walford was born in Edgware, Middlesex in 1934. He pursued higher education at the London School of Economics from 1952 to 1955, graduating with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in Economics. This background in economics would later influence his interest in economic geography and development issues, themes that featured prominently in his educational games and simulations.

Following his undergraduate studies, Walford attended King's College London from 1955 to 1958. It was here that he developed his commitment to education, gaining a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) in 1958. He also obtained a Bachelor of Divinity degree from King's College during this period, reflecting intellectual interests that ranged across the social sciences and humanities. This interdisciplinary foundation characterised his later approach to geography education—he saw geography as connected to history, economics, politics, and the arts, rather than as an isolated academic discipline.

## The Early Teaching Career

After qualifying as a teacher, Walford embarked on a school teaching career that provided the practical foundation for his later work in teacher education. His experience in the classroom gave him an intimate understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing geography teachers, knowledge that would inform his PGCE teaching and his publications.

Walford's early teaching coincided with a period of significant change in geography education. The 1960s and early 1970s saw the emergence of the "new geography"—quantitative approaches, systems theory, and a shift away from regional description towards thematic and problem-based study. Walford embraced these developments while also recognising the importance of engaging students through active learning methods. This synthesis of academic geography with innovative pedagogy would become his trademark contribution to the field.

## Games and Simulations in Geography

### The Pioneering Work

Walford's most influential contribution to geography education was his pioneering work on games and simulations. In 1969, he published "Games in Geography," a book that introduced teachers to the educational potential of games, simulations, and role-play exercises. This publication was groundbreaking—while games had been used sporadically in classrooms, Walford provided a systematic rationale for their use and practical guidance for implementation.

The book emerged from Walford's conviction that traditional teaching methods were not engaging all students effectively. He observed that many students found geography abstract and disconnected from their lived experiences. Games and simulations offered a solution—they made geographical concepts concrete, placed students in decision-making roles, and created emotional engagement with geographical issues.

### Educational Rationale

Walford articulated a clear educational rationale for using games in geography:

**Motivation and Engagement:**
Games captured students' interest and motivation in ways that traditional methods often failed to do. The competitive element, the opportunity for active participation, and the suspension of normal classroom routines all contributed to heightened engagement.

**Experiential Learning:**
Through games, students experienced geographical processes rather than merely reading about them. They could appreciate the complexity of development decisions, the tensions in resource management, or the challenges facing particular groups in society.

**Empathy and Perspective-Taking:**
Walford encouraged children to empathise with real people in real situations. By taking on roles—villagers in a development project, farmers facing land use decisions, urban planners—students developed understanding of different perspectives and the human dimensions of geographical issues.

**Collaborative Learning:**
Many of Walford's games required cooperation and negotiation among players. This developed social skills alongside geographical understanding, preparing students for the collaborative dimensions of citizenship.

**Higher-Order Thinking:**
Games required students to make decisions, evaluate options, anticipate consequences, and reflect on outcomes. These cognitive processes extended beyond recall to analysis, evaluation, and synthesis.

### The "Coldstream" Approach

At Cambridge, Walford developed an innovative course called "Situation and Themes," set in the fictional Coldstream secondary school. This approach immersed trainee teachers in realistic classroom scenarios, using role-play and simulation to prepare them for the complexities of teaching geography. The Coldstream approach recognised that teacher education should go beyond theoretical knowledge to develop practical wisdom and decision-making capabilities.

Trainee teachers encountered situations drawn from real classroom experiences—dealing with disruptive students, responding to unexpected questions, managing group work, assessing student learning. By working through these situations in a supportive environment, trainees developed confidence and competence before facing these challenges in actual classrooms.

The Coldstream approach exemplified Walford's belief that learning should be active, experiential, and enjoyable. Even professional education could be engaging and motivating, rather than dry and theoretical.

## The Cambridge PGCE and Teacher Education

### Leading the Geography PGCE

In 1973, Walford joined the University of Cambridge as Lecturer in Geography and Education. For the next 25 years, he ran the postgraduate (PGCE) teacher-education course for geographers, establishing Cambridge as a leading centre for geography teacher preparation. His influence on the profession was immense—generations of geography teachers across Britain and beyond were shaped by his approach.

Walford's PGCE course was distinctive in several respects:

**Integration of Theory and Practice:**
Rather than separating educational theory from classroom practice, Walford integrated them. Trainees explored theoretical ideas through practical application, and reflected on practical experiences using theoretical frameworks.

**Innovative Pedagogy:**
Walford modelled the teaching approaches he advocated. His sessions were interactive, engaging, and intellectually challenging. Trainees experienced as learners the methods they would later use as teachers.

**Intellectual Rigor:**
Despite the practical focus, Walford maintained high intellectual standards. He encouraged trainees to engage critically with geographical knowledge, to question assumptions, and to develop their own informed perspectives on geographical education.

**Supportive Community:**
Walford fostered a strong sense of community among trainees. He recognised that becoming a teacher involves personal as well as professional development, and created an environment where trainees supported one another through the challenges of the course.

**Enthusiasm and Passion:**
Above all, Walford communicated his passion for geography and education. Trainees were inspired by his enthusiasm and carried this inspiration into their own teaching careers.

### Head of the Education Department

In the early 1990s, Walford served as Head of the University Department of Education at Cambridge. In this leadership role, he influenced teacher education beyond geography, shaping the overall approach to professional preparation across subjects. His commitment to innovative, engaging, and intellectually rigorous teacher education characterised his leadership.

## Pedagogical Principles: What Teachers Can Learn from Walford

### Making Geography Concrete

One of Walford's key insights was the importance of making abstract geographical concepts concrete and experiential. For teachers today, this principle remains vital:

**Use Real-World Contexts:**
Whether through games, case studies, or fieldwork, connecting geography to real situations and real people makes the subject meaningful. Walford showed that even complex issues like development, trade, or resource management can be made accessible through appropriate pedagogical approaches.

**Encourage Active Participation:**
Students learn by doing, deciding, and experiencing. Walford's games required students to make choices, face consequences, and reflect on outcomes. This active learning approach develops deeper understanding than passive reception of information.

**Foster Empathy and Perspective:**
Geography is fundamentally about human experience in different places and contexts. Walford encouraged students to see the world from different perspectives—to understand the challenges facing farmers in developing countries, the decisions facing urban planners, or the experiences of people in different environments.

### The Power of Enthusiasm

Walford's teaching was characterised by infectious enthusiasm. This was not mere performance but reflected genuine passion for geography and education. For teachers, this offers important lessons:

**Communicate Your Passion:**
Students respond to teachers who care about their subject. Walford demonstrated that enthusiasm is catching—when teachers are engaged and excited, students are more likely to engage and care.

**Model Lifelong Learning:**
Walford's continued engagement with new ideas, his wide-ranging interests, and his zest for life modelled lifelong learning. Teachers who continue learning, exploring, and growing inspire students to do the same.

**Find Joy in Teaching:**
Despite the pressures and challenges of education, Walford found joy in teaching. This joy sustained his long career and made him an inspiring presence for colleagues and students alike.

### Balancing Innovation and Rigor

Walford successfully balanced innovative teaching methods with intellectual rigour. His games were not merely entertaining but educationally purposeful. For contemporary teachers, this balance remains essential:

**Ensure Educational Purpose:**
All teaching activities, however engaging, must serve educational goals. Walford designed games to achieve specific learning outcomes—to understand processes, develop empathy, or explore decisions.

**Maintain Intellectual Challenge:**
Engagement should not come at the cost of intellectual challenge. Walford's games required students to think, decide, evaluate, and reflect. The engagement supported higher-order thinking rather than replacing it.

**Evaluate and Reflect:**
Walford called for evaluation of games and simulations to understand their effectiveness. Teachers should assess whether innovative approaches are achieving intended learning outcomes and adjust accordingly.

## Walford's Work in Context: The History of Geography Education

### The "New Geography" Movement

Walford's career coincided with the "new geography" movement of the 1960s and 1970s. This movement sought to transform geography from a descriptive, regional subject into an analytical, thematic discipline drawing on scientific methods. Walford engaged with these developments while also recognising the importance of humanistic and experiential approaches.

His games and simulations reflected the "new geography's" interest in processes, systems, and decision-making. However, he ensured that these analytical approaches remained connected to human experience and real-world contexts. This synthesis of the scientific and humanistic traditions in geography characterised his contribution to the field.

### The National Curriculum Era

Walford's leadership of the GA and his involvement in National Curriculum development placed him at the centre of major changes in British education. The introduction of the National Curriculum in the 1990s transformed geography from an optional subject to a statutory foundation subject.

Walford's contributions helped ensure that the National Curriculum for geography was educationally sound—combining knowledge and skills, local and global content, and substantive and procedural understanding. His influence can be seen in the curriculum's emphasis on geographical enquiry, the balance between breadth and depth, and the attention to both human and physical geography.

### Contemporary Relevance

Many of the issues Walford engaged with remain relevant today:

**Active Learning in an Age of Accountability:**
The tension between engaging, experiential learning and the pressures of accountability and testing persists. Walford's work offers resources for teachers seeking to maintain active learning approaches within constrained contexts.

**Technology and Geography Education:**
Walford noted the emergence of computer-based simulations in his 1995 reflection. Today, digital technologies—including GIS, virtual fieldwork, and online simulations—offer new possibilities for the kind of experiential learning Walford championed.

**Global Learning and Citizenship:**
Walford's emphasis on empathy, perspective-taking, and understanding global interconnections aligns with contemporary concerns about global citizenship education and the role of geography in preparing students for a globalised world.

**Teacher Professionalism:**
The recognition of teaching as a profession requiring subject-specific expertise, which Walford championed, remains important in debates about teacher education and professional development.
