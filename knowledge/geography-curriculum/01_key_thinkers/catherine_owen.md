This profile explores Owen's career trajectory, her key contributions to geography education, and the ongoing influence of her work on curriculum development and teacher professional learning.

## Biography and Career

### Early Career and Classroom Experience

Catherine Owen's career in geography education began in the classroom, where she developed the practical understanding of teaching and learning that would later inform her leadership and development work. Her early experience as a geography teacher provided her with firsthand knowledge of the challenges and opportunities facing geography educators, particularly in maintaining the integrity and distinctiveness of the subject within increasingly crowded curricula.

Through her classroom practice, Owen developed particular interests in:
- Curriculum design and the sequencing of geographical learning
- The development of students' geographical thinking and understanding
- The role of fieldwork and practical enquiry in geographical education
- Supporting students in engaging with complex geographical concepts

### Geographical Association Leadership

Owen's involvement with the Geographical Association—the UK's leading subject association for geography teachers—has been central to her professional identity and influence. Her progression within the GA demonstrates both her commitment to the subject community and the respect she has earned from fellow geography educators.

**Presidency of the Geographical Association**

Owen served as President of the Geographical Association, a role that placed her at the forefront of geography education nationally. The GA Presidency is a significant leadership position within the subject community, involving:
- Representing geography education in national forums and policy discussions
- Setting the tone and direction for the association's work
- Advocating for the subject in an educational climate that has sometimes marginalised geography
- Supporting the development of the association's strategic priorities

During her presidency, Owen emphasised themes that have characterised her work more broadly: the importance of curriculum thinking, the role of teachers as curriculum makers, and the need for geography education to remain intellectually ambitious while accessible to all learners.

**Curriculum Development and Teacher Support**

Beyond her presidential role, Owen has contributed to the Geographical Association's extensive programme of curriculum development and teacher support. The GA's work in this area includes:
- Publishing curriculum guidance and teaching resources
- Organising conferences and professional development events
- Supporting local geography teacher networks
- Advocating for geography within national policy discussions

Owen's contributions have helped ensure that this work remains grounded in classroom realities while being intellectually ambitious and informed by contemporary geographical scholarship.

## Key Contributions to Geography Education

### Curriculum Making and Teacher Agency

Perhaps Owen's most significant contribution to geography education lies in her advocacy for and development of the concept of **curriculum making**. This approach positions teachers not merely as implementers of externally prescribed curricula but as active agents who make curricular decisions based on their understanding of:
- The geographical knowledge that is most worthwhile for their students
- The particular needs, interests, and contexts of their learners
- The relationship between academic geography and school geography
- The available resources and opportunities for geographical learning

**The Curriculum Making Project**

Owen's work on the Curriculum Making project, developed in collaboration with the Geographical Association and academic partners, represents a significant contribution to how we understand curriculum development in geography. The project emphasises that:

- Curriculum is not merely a document to be delivered but a process of making meaning
- Teachers are curriculum makers who bring together disciplinary knowledge, pedagogical expertise, and contextual understanding
- Effective curriculum development requires professional learning communities where teachers can collaborate and share practice
- The relationship between the academic discipline and school geography is dynamic and requires ongoing negotiation

The Curriculum Making approach has been influential in supporting geography teachers to engage deeply with questions of what to teach, why it matters, and how best to enable students' geographical learning.

### Powerful Knowledge and Geography Education

Owen's work has engaged with the concept of **powerful knowledge**, developed by the sociologist of education Michael Young and applied to geography by figures such as David Lambert. Powerful knowledge refers to the specialised, systematic knowledge that is distinct from common-sense or everyday knowledge and which gives learners capabilities they would not otherwise develop.

In geography education, the powerful knowledge concept has been used to:
- Articulate what makes geographical knowledge distinctive and valuable
- Defend the subject against pressures to become merely topical or skills-based
- Inform curriculum decisions about what geographical content is most worthwhile
- Support arguments for maintaining the integrity and ambition of geography in the curriculum

Owen's contributions have helped translate the powerful knowledge concept into practical curriculum thinking, supporting teachers in making decisions about content selection and sequencing that are informed by disciplinary thinking about what constitutes powerful geographical knowledge.

### Subject Leadership and Professional Learning

Throughout her career, Owen has been a strong advocate for the importance of **subject leadership** and **subject-specific professional learning**. In an educational climate that has sometimes emphasised generic teaching skills over subject expertise, Owen's work has consistently asserted that:

- Subject knowledge and subject pedagogical knowledge are essential for effective teaching
- Subject communities, such as the Geographical Association, play a vital role in sustaining and developing teacher expertise
- Professional learning is most effective when it is subject-specific and closely connected to classroom practice
- Subject leaders need support and development to fulfil their curriculum and pedagogical responsibilities

Her work in this area has supported the development of programmes and resources for geography subject leaders, recognising the critical role that middle leaders play in curriculum development and pedagogical improvement.

## The Geographical Association and Subject Community

### The Role of Subject Associations

Owen's career illustrates the vital role that subject associations play in the educational ecosystem. The Geographical Association, founded in 1893, serves as:
- A guardian of the subject, advocating for geography within national policy discussions
- A professional learning community, connecting geography educators across contexts
- A publisher of resources, guidance, and research related to geography education
- A network of local branches and special interest groups
- An organiser of conferences and professional development events

Through her leadership within the GA, Owen has contributed to all of these functions, helping ensure that geography teachers across England (and beyond) have access to the support, resources, and professional community they need to develop their practice.

### Curriculum Resources and Publications

Under Owen's influence and leadership, the Geographical Association has developed extensive curriculum resources that support teachers in implementing the National Curriculum while maintaining the intellectual integrity of the subject. These resources include:

- **Curriculum Making materials**: Guidance and case studies supporting teachers in developing their curricula
- **Primary geography resources**: Supporting the development of geography in the primary phase, where the subject often struggles for time and attention
- **Subject leadership materials**: Resources to support geography coordinators and heads of department
- **Assessment guidance**: Support for developing effective assessment practices in geography

These resources are characterised by their combination of academic rigour and practical classroom applicability, reflecting Owen's commitment to bridging theory and practice.

## Key Themes in Owen's Work

### The Relationship Between Academic and School Geography

A persistent theme in Owen's contributions concerns the relationship between **academic geography** (as practised in universities) and **school geography** (as taught in classrooms). This relationship is not straightforward:

- School geography cannot simply replicate academic geography—selection and transformation are necessary
- However, school geography should remain connected to and informed by the academic discipline
- Teachers need support in understanding developments in academic geography and their implications for school curriculum
- The curriculum is a selection from academic geography, made for educational purposes

Owen's work has supported geography teachers in navigating this relationship, developing curricula that are educationally appropriate while remaining true to the nature of geographical knowledge.

### Equity and Access in Geography Education

Another theme in Owen's work concerns **equity and access** in geography education. This includes:
- Ensuring that all learners, regardless of background, have access to powerful geographical knowledge
- Addressing the relationship between geography education and pupils' existing geographical experiences
- Considering how curriculum choices might include or exclude certain learners
- Supporting teachers in making geography relevant and engaging for diverse student populations

This concern for equity is reflected in the GA's commitment to supporting teachers in all contexts, including those working in challenging circumstances or with limited resources.

### The Future of Geography Education

As a leader in the field, Owen has contributed to discussions about the **future of geography education** in a changing educational landscape. Key considerations include:
- The impact of curriculum and assessment policy changes on geography
- The role of technology and digital resources in geographical learning
- The relationship between geography education and contemporary global challenges (climate change, migration, globalisation)
- The maintenance of fieldwork and practical enquiry in an era of cost constraints and health and safety concerns
- The recruitment and retention of geography teachers

Through conference presentations, publications, and policy engagement, Owen has helped geography educators navigate these challenges while maintaining their commitment to high-quality, intellectually ambitious geographical education.

## Influence and Legacy

### Impact on Curriculum Development

Owen's work on curriculum making has influenced how geography teachers and curriculum leaders approach the development of their programmes of study. The Curriculum Making framework provides:
- A conceptual language for discussing curricular decisions
- A set of principles for evaluating and developing curriculum
- A reminder of the importance of teacher agency in curriculum development
- Support for professional conversations about what to teach and why

Schools and departments that have engaged with the Curriculum Making approach report that it supports more purposeful and coherent curriculum development, moving beyond coverage-focused approaches to think more deeply about the nature and purpose of geographical learning.

### Contribution to Professional Learning

Through her work with the Geographical Association and her contributions to professional learning programmes, Owen has influenced the development of geography teachers at all stages of their careers. This includes:
- Initial teacher education and the development of new geography teachers
- Early career support for teachers in their first years
- Ongoing professional development for experienced practitioners
- Subject leadership development for coordinators and heads of department

The emphasis throughout is on subject-specific professional learning that connects to classroom practice and to the distinctive nature of geographical knowledge.

### Connection to Broader Curriculum Thinking

Owen's work connects to broader developments in curriculum thinking in England and internationally. The Curriculum Making approach resonates with:
- Michael Young's work on powerful knowledge and the future of education
- The development of knowledge-rich curriculum approaches
- Renewed interest in curriculum as a focus for educational improvement
- Recognition of the importance of subject communities in teacher development

By contributing to these broader conversations while maintaining a focus on the specific characteristics of geographical knowledge, Owen has helped ensure that geography education is well-positioned within contemporary curriculum debates.

## Critiques and Debates

### Balancing Structure and Agency

As with any approach that emphasises teacher agency, the Curriculum Making framework must navigate the tension between structure and agency:
- How much freedom should teachers have to adapt prescribed curricula?
- What are the implications for equity if curricula vary significantly between schools?
- How can teacher agency be supported without overwhelming teachers with curriculum development responsibilities?

Owen's work engages with these tensions, arguing that curriculum making is not a free-for-all but a disciplined process informed by the nature of the subject and the needs of learners.

### The Challenge of Implementation

The ambitious vision of curriculum making can be challenging to implement in practice, particularly given:
- Time constraints on teachers and subject leaders
- Limited resources for curriculum development in many schools
- The dominance of assessment and accountability measures in shaping practice
- Variability in teachers' subject knowledge and curriculum expertise

Owen's work acknowledges these challenges and has sought to provide practical support for implementation through the GA's resources and professional development programmes.

## Practical Applications for Teachers

### Questions for Curriculum Reflection

Drawing on Owen's work, geography teachers and curriculum leaders might ask:

1. **What geographical knowledge is most powerful for our students?**
   - What will give them capabilities they wouldn't otherwise develop?
   - What is distinctive about geographical knowledge compared to common-sense knowledge?

2. **How are we making curriculum decisions?**
   - What is driving our content and sequencing choices?
   - How are we drawing on the academic discipline of geography?
   - How are we responding to our particular context and learners?

3. **What is the role of the subject community in our development?**
   - How are we engaging with the Geographical Association and geography networks?
   - How are we contributing to and learning from the broader subject community?

4. **How are we supporting teacher development?**
   - What opportunities do teachers have to develop their subject knowledge?
   - How are we building a culture of collaborative curriculum development?

### Strategies for Curriculum Development

Owen's work suggests several strategies for effective curriculum development:

- **Engage with the academic discipline**: Stay connected to developments in academic geography and consider their implications for school curriculum
- **Collaborate with colleagues**: Use the Curriculum Making framework to structure professional conversations about curriculum
- **Draw on subject community resources**: Make use of GA publications, conferences, and networks
- **Focus on knowledge**: Prioritise decisions about what geographical knowledge is most worthwhile
- **Maintain intellectual ambition**: Ensure that curriculum decisions support all learners in accessing powerful geographical knowledge

## Conclusion

Catherine Owen's contributions to geography education exemplify the vital role that subject leaders and subject communities play in maintaining and developing educational practice. Through her work on curriculum making, powerful knowledge, and subject-specific professional learning, she has supported geography teachers in navigating the complexities of curriculum development while maintaining their commitment to intellectually ambitious geographical education.

The themes that characterise her work—teacher agency, the importance of subject knowledge, the role of subject communities, and the connection between academic and school geography—remain highly relevant as geography educators respond to ongoing policy changes and educational challenges. Her legacy lies not only in specific publications or programmes but in the broader culture of curriculum thinking and professional collaboration that she has helped foster within the geography education community.

For geography teachers and curriculum leaders, Owen's work offers both conceptual frameworks for thinking about curriculum and practical support for developing their practice.
