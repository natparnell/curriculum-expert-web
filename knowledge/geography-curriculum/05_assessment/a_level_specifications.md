# A Level Geography Specifications: AQA, Edexcel, and OCR

## Overview

A Level Geography in England is offered by three main awarding bodies: AQA, Pearson Edexcel, and OCR. Each specification shares common structural elements mandated by Ofqual's subject criteria, including the requirement for synoptic assessment and an independent investigation (Non-Examined Assessment, or NEA). However, each board organises content differently, employs distinct assessment approaches, and offers varying degrees of flexibility in topic selection.

Understanding these differences is essential for teachers designing curriculum sequences, selecting case studies, and preparing students for the specific demands of their chosen specification.

## AQA A Level Geography (7037)

### Specification Structure

AQA's A Level Geography specification is organised into two examination papers and one non-examined assessment component:

| Component | Content | Weighting |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Paper 1: Physical Geography | Water and carbon cycles; Hot desert systems and landscapes; Coastal systems and landscapes; Glacial systems and landscapes; Hazards; Ecosystems under stress | 40% |
| Paper 2: Human Geography | Global systems and global governance; Changing places; Contemporary urban environments; Population and the environment; Resource security | 40% |
| NEA: Independent Fieldwork Investigation | Student-designed investigation | 20% |

### Physical Geography Options

AQA requires students to study **two** physical geography topics from a choice of six. The **Water and Carbon Cycles** topic is compulsory for all students.

### Human Geography Options

Students study **two** human geography topics from a choice of five. **Changing Places** is the compulsory human topic.

### Assessment Characteristics

AQA papers employ a consistent question structure with MCQs, short-answer questions, essay questions (20 marks), and fieldwork questions embedded within Papers 1 and 2.

## Pearson Edexcel A Level Geography

### Specification Structure

Edexcel's specification organises content into four examination papers plus the NEA:

| Component | Content | Weighting |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Paper 1: Dynamic Landscapes | Tectonic Processes and Hazards; Coastal or Glaciated Landscapes | 30% |
| Paper 2: Dynamic Places | Globalisation; Regenerating Places; Diverse Places | 30% |
| Paper 3: Physical Systems and Sustainability | Water Cycle, Carbon Cycle, Climate Change Futures | 20% |
| Paper 4: Human Systems and Geopolitics | Superpowers; Global Development and Connections | 20% |
| NEA: Independent Investigation | Student-designed investigation | 20% |

### Distinctive Features

**Dedicated Synoptic Papers:** Papers 3 and 4 are explicitly designed as synoptic assessments examining students' ability to draw together knowledge from across the full course.

**Fieldwork Integration:** Unlike AQA, Edexcel does not include fieldwork questions on written examination papers. All fieldwork assessment is concentrated in the NEA.

## OCR A Level Geography (H481)

### Specification Structure

OCR's specification comprises three examination components plus the NEA:

| Component | Content | Weighting |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Physical Systems (H481/01) | Landscape Systems (choose two from Coastal, Glacial, or Dryland); Earth's Life Support Systems | 24% |
| Human Interactions (H481/02) | Changing Spaces, Making Places; Global Connections (choose two from Trade, Migration, or Human Rights) | 24% |
| Geographical Debates (H481/03) | Two topics from: Climate Change, Disease Dilemmas, Exploring Oceans, Future of Food, Hazardous Earth | 32% |
| NEA: Investigative Geography | Independent investigation | 20% |

### Unique Features

The Geographical Debates paper is inherently synoptic, requiring students to evaluate contested perspectives using knowledge from across their course.

## The Independent Investigation (NEA)

### Common Requirements

| Feature | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Word count | 3,000–4,000 words |
| Weighting | 20% of total A Level |
| Primary data | Must involve fieldwork |
| Independence | Student-designed question, methodology, and analysis |

### AQA Requirements

Students must complete a Candidate Record Form (CRF) with proposal, declaration, and teacher sign-off. The investigation is "not restricted to fieldwork," allowing secondary data research combined with fieldwork elements.

### Edexcel Requirements

Online submission through the Learner Work Transfer (LWT) system is now required. Assessment uses four objectives (15 marks each) covering design, data collection, analysis, and evaluation.

### OCR Requirements

Students must complete an Independent Investigation Proposal Form before data collection. The NEA is marked out of 60 across design (15), data collection (10), presentation (10), analysis (15), and conclusions (10).

## Synoptic Assessment

### What is Synopticity?

Synoptic assessment tests understanding of connections between different elements of geography including topic links, place links, scale links, and perspective links.

### By Awarding Body

- **AQA:** Embedded synoptic questions throughout Papers 1 and 2
- **Edexcel:** Dedicated synoptic Papers 3 and 4 with resource booklets
- **OCR:** Geographical Debates paper integrating physical and human geography

### Teaching for Synopticity

Effective approaches include planning explicit links when sequencing topics, using concept mapping, and practising with past synoptic questions.

## Comparative Summary

| Feature | AQA (7037) | Edexcel | OCR (H481) |
|---------|-----------|---------|------------|
| Examination papers | 2 (80%) | 4 (80%) | 3 (80%) |
| Physical topics | 2 from 6 | Tectonics + 1 from 2 | 2 from 3 + Water/Carbon |
| Human topics | 2 from 5 | Globalisation + Regeneration + 1 | Places + 2 from 3 |
| Synoptic approach | Embedded | Dedicated Papers | Debates Paper |
| Fieldwork in exams | Yes | No | No |
| NEA flexibility | High | Moderate | Moderate |

## Implications for Curriculum Planning

Schools select specifications based on content preferences, assessment philosophy, and staff expertise. Effective A Level teaching begins with foundational topics, integrates fieldwork early, builds synoptic awareness progressively, and allocates 6-8 weeks for the NEA.
