# Formative Assessment in Geography

Formative assessment, commonly referred to as Assessment for Learning (AfL), represents a fundamental shift from viewing assessment as something that happens *to* pupils at the end of a unit, to understanding it as an integral part of the daily teaching and learning process. In geography education, formative assessment serves as the bridge between curriculum intent and pupil outcomes, enabling teachers to systematically check understanding, identify misconceptions, and adapt their teaching to meet the diverse needs of learners.

The Geographical Association (2024) identifies formative assessment strategies as encompassing questioning, feedback, peer- and self-assessment, and the formative use of summative tests. These strategies are not additional activities layered onto an already full curriculum but rather embedded approaches that enhance the quality of geographical learning and teaching.

## The Principles of Assessment for Learning in Geography

### Defining Formative Assessment

Formative assessment is defined by its purpose: to inform teaching and learning whilst both are still happening. The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) Teaching and Learning Toolkit identifies feedback as having one of the highest impacts on pupil attainment, with an average effect size of 0.61. However, the quality and timeliness of that feedback determine its effectiveness. Dylan Wiliam (2011), in his influential work *Embedded Formative Assessment*, argues that formative assessment is not a single technique but a collection of practices that share the common feature of providing information about pupil learning that can be used to adjust teaching.

In geography, this means creating regular opportunities within lessons to check whether pupils have understood geographical concepts, can apply geographical skills, and are developing the ability to think geographically. The Geographical Association (2024) emphasises that formative assessment should give pupils "an understanding of how they are doing, how to improve their learning experiences and how to help them to do better."

### The Role of the Teacher

Teachers of geography must systematically check pupils' understanding so that they identify misconceptions and provide clear feedback. This requires a shift from the traditional model of teaching as knowledge transmission to teaching as responsive facilitation. Teachers use the information obtained through assessment to respond to pupils and adapt their teaching as necessary.

The Ofsted inspection framework expects teachers to ensure that ongoing feedback is provided to pupils and that the curriculum builds pupils' knowledge incrementally. In geography deep dives, inspectors look for evidence that teachers are using assessment to check understanding and address gaps before moving on to new content.

## Questioning Strategies in the Geography Classroom

### The Importance of Teacher Questioning

Questioning is perhaps the most ubiquitous form of formative assessment in the classroom. Every geography lesson contains dozens, if not hundreds, of questions posed by teachers. However, not all questioning is equally effective for assessment purposes. The Geographical Association (2025) identifies five 'dialogic moves' based on Howe's research that counter the limitations of the traditional Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) pattern:

1. **Wait after questions** – providing thinking time before expecting a response
2. **Invite more detail** – asking follow-up questions that probe deeper understanding
3. **Pass on** – asking other students to respond to or build upon a peer's answer
4. **Stay neutral** – avoiding immediate judgement that might close down discussion
5. **Include** – ensuring all pupils have opportunities to contribute

These moves transform questioning from a simple checking mechanism into a sophisticated tool for uncovering thinking and promoting deeper geographical understanding.

### Wait Time and Its Impact

Mary Budd Rowe's seminal research on wait time demonstrated that when teachers wait at least three seconds after posing a question, the length and quality of pupil responses increases significantly. In geography, where complex spatial relationships and abstract concepts require processing, wait time is particularly valuable.

The think-pair-share strategy, widely used across geography classrooms, formalises this approach. Pupils first consider a question individually (think), then discuss their ideas with a partner (pair), before sharing with the wider class (share). This ensures that all pupils engage with the question, not just those who raise their hands, and provides processing time that benefits particularly those who need longer to formulate their thoughts.

### Bloom's Taxonomy and Geographical Questioning

Effective questioning in geography requires a deliberate balance between lower-order and higher-order questions. Bloom's Taxonomy provides a useful framework for ensuring that questioning promotes cognitive development alongside geographical learning:

**Remembering (Level 1):** Questions that recall facts and terminology
- "What is the capital city of Brazil?"
- "Name three types of weathering"

**Understanding (Level 2):** Questions that check comprehension
- "Explain why rain shadows occur on the leeward side of mountains"
- "Describe the difference between weather and climate"

**Applying (Level 3):** Questions that require using knowledge in new contexts
- "How would the water cycle operate differently in a desert environment?"
- "Apply the concept of push-pull factors to migration from rural to urban areas"

**Analysing (Level 4):** Questions that break down information and examine relationships
- "What factors contribute to the flooding risk in this river catchment?"
- "Compare the causes of earthquakes at constructive and destructive plate boundaries"

**Evaluating (Level 5):** Questions that require judgement based on criteria
- "To what extent is tourism the best strategy for economic development?"
- "Assess the effectiveness of coastal management strategies at this location"

**Creating (Level 6):** Questions that require generating new ideas or products
- "Design a sustainable urban plan for this growing city"
- "Develop a campaign to reduce plastic pollution in local waterways"

Geography teachers should aim for a progression across lessons and units, starting with questions that establish foundational knowledge before moving to more demanding analytical and evaluative questions.

### Hinge Questions

Hinge questions, a concept developed by Dylan Wiliam, are diagnostic multiple-choice questions used at a critical 'hinge point' in a lesson—moments where the teacher needs to check whether pupils are ready to move on. Well-designed hinge questions have distractors (wrong answers) that reveal specific misconceptions.

In geography, a hinge question might be:

*"Which statement best explains why the UK has a temperate climate?"
A) It is surrounded by sea
B) It is located at 50-60°N latitude and affected by the North Atlantic Drift
C) It is a small island
D) It has mountains in the north and west*

Pupils responding with A demonstrate partial understanding but have confused maritime influence with the primary determinant. Those choosing C may hold a misconception about size affecting climate. The teacher can immediately see who has understood and who needs additional support.

### No-Hands-Up Questioning

Traditional classroom practice involves teachers posing questions and pupils raising hands to answer. This approach has significant limitations as a formative assessment tool: it allows some pupils to opt out entirely, creates inequitable participation patterns, and provides the teacher with information only about those who volunteer.

No-hands-up questioning, sometimes implemented using lollipop sticks with pupil names, random selection, or planned cold calling, ensures that all pupils remain engaged and that the teacher gathers representative information about the class's understanding. As Teach Like a Champion (2022) notes, however, random selection alone lacks the intentionality of strategic cold calling—teachers should also use their knowledge of pupils to target questions that will reveal specific learning needs or provide opportunities for particular pupils to succeed publicly.

## Feedback Strategies in Geography

### The Problem with Traditional Marking

The workload challenge associated with teacher marking has been well documented. The Department for Education's (2016) report *Eliminating Unnecessary Workload Around Marking* found that "marking has evolved into an unhelpful burden for teachers, when the time it takes is not repaid in positive impact on pupils' progress." The report recommended that all marking should be "meaningful, manageable and motivating."

This finding has particular relevance for geography, where teachers often face large class sizes and may see hundreds of pupils across a week. Traditional approaches involving extensive written comments in exercise books are neither sustainable nor necessarily effective.

### Principles of Effective Feedback

Effective feedback in geography, as in all subjects, should be:

**Specific and actionable** – Generic comments such as "good work" or "try harder" provide pupils with no guidance for improvement. Effective feedback identifies what has been done well and precisely what needs to be improved, with concrete steps for doing so.

**Timely** – Feedback has most impact when it is provided during or immediately after the learning activity. Geography teachers should build opportunities for feedback into lesson planning rather than relying solely on post-lesson marking.

**Focused** – Attempting to correct every error in a piece of work overwhelms pupils and dilutes the impact of feedback. Dylan Wiliam recommends "detective marking" where the teacher identifies the number of errors but not their location, requiring pupils to find and correct them.

**Forward-looking** – The most effective feedback focuses on the next piece of work rather than the last. This 'feedforward' approach asks: what will you do differently next time based on what you have learned from this work?

### Oral Feedback

Given the limitations of written marking, oral feedback represents a powerful alternative. The Geographical Association (2024) notes that teachers should "think about ways you can provide feedback during a lesson and build time for this into your planning."

Oral feedback can take multiple forms:

- **Whole-class feedback** – Addressing common misconceptions identified through circulating during independent work
- **Individual conversations** – Brief targeted discussions with pupils during lessons
- **Verbal feedback stamps** – Recording that oral feedback has been provided for accountability purposes

Research suggests that oral feedback has equivalent or greater impact on learning compared to written feedback, whilst taking significantly less teacher time.

### Whole-Class Feedback

Whole-class feedback has emerged as a particularly effective strategy for geography teachers. Rather than writing individual comments in every book, the teacher reviews all work, identifies patterns of strength and areas for development, and presents these to the class as a whole.

A typical whole-class feedback session might involve:

1. Sharing excellent examples of geographical thinking or writing, anonymised or with permission
2. Identifying common misconceptions, such as confusing weathering and erosion
3. Modelling how to improve responses, perhaps by showing how to structure a more detailed explanation
4. Providing dedicated time for pupils to apply the feedback to their own work

This approach makes feedback a visible, collective process rather than a private transaction between teacher and pupil, and allows pupils to learn from each other's work as well as their own.

### Success Criteria and Rubrics

Clear success criteria enable pupils to self-assess and peer-assess effectively. In geography, success criteria should move beyond generic descriptions of quality to identify specific characteristics of excellent geographical work.

For example, success criteria for a piece of extended writing about river landscapes might include:

- Uses geographical terminology accurately (meanders, erosion, deposition, oxbow lake)
- Explains processes in sequence, showing how one leads to another
- Links features to the processes that created them
- Includes relevant case study examples
- Structures the explanation logically with clear paragraphing

When pupils understand what excellence looks like, they are better positioned to evaluate their own work and that of their peers.

## Peer and Self-Assessment

### Developing Pupil Autonomy

Peer and self-assessment are not primarily about reducing teacher workload—they are about developing pupils' ability to evaluate their own learning and take responsibility for their progress. The Geographical Association (2024) notes that "peer-assessment can, therefore, help students to develop and hone their own self-assessment skills."

As the Education Endowment Foundation identifies, peer tutoring (which includes peer assessment) has positive impacts on both the tutor and the tutee. In geography, this might involve pupils checking each other's map work, evaluating the quality of geographical explanations, or providing feedback on the structure of extended writing.

### Structuring Effective Peer Assessment

Effective peer assessment requires careful scaffolding. Pupils need:

**Clear criteria** – What exactly should they be looking for? Generic prompts such as "check your partner's work" are insufficient. Specific prompts such as "has your partner used at least three pieces of map evidence to support their conclusion?" enable focused, useful feedback.

**Modelling** – Teachers should model what constructive feedback looks like, perhaps by providing examples and asking pupils to evaluate their quality.

**Protocols** – Structured approaches such as "two stars and a wish" (two things done well, one thing to improve) or TAG (Tell your partner something they did well, Ask a question, Give a suggestion) provide scaffolds that ensure feedback is balanced and constructive.

**Training** – Like any skill, peer assessment requires explicit teaching and regular practice. Teachers should not expect pupils to provide high-quality feedback without having been taught how to do so.

### Self-Assessment Strategies

Self-assessment develops pupils' metacognitive awareness—their understanding of their own learning processes. In geography, self-assessment might involve:

**Traffic lighting** – Pupils indicate their confidence level with green (confident), amber (partially confident), or red (not confident) for specific learning objectives or skills

**Pre-topic questions** – The Geographical Association (2024) suggests using sticky notes for pupils to generate questions at the start of a new topic, creating a display that is removed as each question is answered throughout the unit

**Target setting** – Building on feedback received, pupils identify specific targets for their next piece of work

**Self-assessment sheets** – Structured proformas that guide pupils through evaluating their work against success criteria, with space for identifying their own next steps

Research from the Education Endowment Foundation suggests that self-regulation strategies have significant positive impacts on learning, with an average effect size of 0.62.

## Embedding Formative Assessment in Geography Planning

### Planning for Assessment Opportunities

Formative assessment is most effective when it is planned rather than improvised. Geography teachers should identify where in each lesson they will check understanding and how they will respond if misconceptions are revealed.

The Geographical Association (2024) advises teachers to ask themselves: "Where are the opportunities for questions and dialogue into which I can integrate formative assessment?" Every lesson contains such opportunities, but they are most powerful when deliberately designed.

### Responsive Teaching

The ultimate purpose of formative assessment is to enable responsive teaching—adjusting instruction based on what assessment reveals about pupil learning. This might involve:

- **Re-teaching** – If a hinge question reveals that a significant proportion of the class has not understood a key concept, the teacher may need to re-teach it using a different approach
- **Differentiation** – If assessment reveals a spread of understanding, the teacher might provide different activities for different groups
- **Addressing misconceptions** – If common misconceptions are identified, the teacher can explicitly address and correct them
- **Accelerating** – If pupils demonstrate secure understanding, the teacher can move more quickly or provide greater challenge

### Using Assessment to Inform Curriculum Design

Formative assessment should also inform medium- and long-term planning. Patterns across classes and over time reveal which geographical concepts pupils typically find challenging, where misconceptions commonly arise, and which skills require more emphasis. This information should feed into curriculum review and refinement.

## Assessment for Learning Across Key Stages

### Primary Geography

In primary geography, formative assessment must be age-appropriate and integrated into active learning. Young children learn geography through exploration, investigation, and talk. Assessment opportunities arise through:

- **Observation** – Watching how children use maps, globes, and atlases
- **Discussion** – Listening to children's geographical talk during fieldwork and enquiry activities
- **Questioning** – Using open questions that encourage children to explain their geographical thinking
- **Children's questions** – Taking children's own geographical questions seriously as evidence of their developing curiosity and understanding

The Geography South West Stepping Stones guidance notes that short map skill checks and other quick AfL activities can be valuable, though assessment should always remain contextualised within geographical enquiry rather than becoming decontextualised testing.

### Secondary Geography

At secondary level, formative assessment becomes increasingly focused on the development of geographical writing, analysis, and evaluation. Key strategies include:

- **Modelling** – Showing pupils what excellent geographical responses look like
- **Scaffolding** – Providing structures that help pupils develop extended geographical explanations
- **Drafting and redrafting** – Using feedback to improve work before final submission
- **Exam technique practice** – Regular low-stakes practice of examination skills with immediate feedback

### Transition Between Key Stages

Formative assessment has a particularly important role at transition points. Year 6 teachers can pass on rich information about pupils' geographical understanding and skills to Year 7 teachers, whilst secondary teachers can use early assessment to identify and address gaps that might otherwise widen over time.

## Conclusion

Formative assessment in geography is not a set of additional activities but a fundamental approach to teaching that places pupil learning at the centre of every decision. Through skilled questioning, timely feedback, and the development of pupil self-assessment, geography teachers can ensure that they are constantly adapting their teaching to meet the needs of their learners.

The evidence is clear: formative assessment has one of the strongest impacts on pupil achievement of any educational intervention. For geography teachers, the challenge is not whether to engage with AfL but how to embed it effectively within the rich, complex domain of geographical learning. The strategies outlined in this article provide a foundation for that work, but like all aspects of teaching, formative assessment requires ongoing reflection, adaptation, and professional learning.

As Dylan Wiliam (2011) notes, the goal is not perfect assessment but rather a relentless focus on using assessment to improve teaching and learning. In geography, this means using every question, every piece of feedback, and every opportunity for pupil reflection to deepen geographical understanding and develop the next generation of geographically informed citizens.
