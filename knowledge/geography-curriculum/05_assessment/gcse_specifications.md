# GCSE Geography Specifications: AQA, Edexcel and OCR Comparison

## Overview

The GCSE Geography landscape in England is dominated by three major awarding bodies: AQA, Pearson Edexcel, and OCR. Each offers specifications that, whilst sharing common DfE-mandated requirements, differ significantly in structure, content emphasis, and assessment approach. Understanding these differences is essential for curriculum leaders making specification choices and for teachers seeking to understand the broader assessment landscape.

All GCSE Geography specifications must comply with the Department for Education's subject content requirements (first published 2014, with subsequent clarifications). These statutory requirements establish the minimum content and assessment structure that all specifications must follow, ensuring comparability across awarding bodies whilst allowing each board to develop distinctive approaches.

## DfE Subject Content Requirements: The Common Framework

The DfE's geography GCSE subject content document establishes non-negotiable requirements that bind all awarding bodies. These statutory requirements create the foundation upon which each specification is built.

### Core Content Requirements

All GCSE Geography specifications must include:

- **Locational knowledge**: Extending from local to global scales, including the accurate location of places and environments at various scales
- **Place knowledge**: Contextual understanding of regions, countries, and environments across the world
- **Physical geography processes**: Including weather and climate, ecosystems, and geomorphological processes
- **Human geography processes**: Including population, urbanisation, economic activity, and development
- **Geographical skills**: Including cartographic, graphical, numerical, and statistical skills
- **Fieldwork**: Both physical and human geography investigations involving primary data collection

### Assessment Structure Requirements

The DfE mandates a three-component assessment structure:

- **Component 1**: Living with the physical environment (35% of qualification)
- **Component 2**: Challenges in the human environment (35% of qualification)
- **Component 3**: Geographical applications (30% of qualification)

Component 3 must include:
- A critical thinking and problem-solving element based on a contemporary geographical issue
- Fieldwork assessment (both familiar and unfamiliar contexts)

### Fieldwork Requirements

The DE requirements (paragraphs 11, 12, 21, 22 and 24 of the subject content document) specify that:

- Fieldwork must include exploration of physical and human processes and their interactions
- Students must collect primary physical and human data
- Fieldwork must take place outside the classroom on at least two occasions
- One fieldwork investigation must relate to physical geography themes
- One fieldwork investigation must relate to human geography themes
- Fieldwork must be assessed through examination, with questions relating to both students' own fieldwork experiences and unfamiliar contexts

Notably, the 2022 pandemic-related modifications temporarily adjusted fieldwork requirements for examination purposes, but these have now been fully reinstated for all cohorts.

## AQA GCSE Geography (8035)

AQA's specification is the most widely entered GCSE Geography qualification in England, with approximately 50% market share. The specification is characterised by clear topic organisation and comprehensive support materials.

### Specification Structure

AQA organises content into three examined papers:

**Paper 1: Living with the Physical Environment (35%)**
- Section A: The Challenge of Natural Hazards
- Section B: The Living World
- Section C: Physical Landscapes in the UK

**Paper 2: Challenges in the Human Environment (35%)**
- Section A: Urban Issues and Challenges
- Section B: The Changing Economic World
- Section C: The Challenge of Resource Management

**Paper 3: Geographical Applications (30%)**
- Section A: Issue Evaluation
- Section B: Fieldwork
- Section C: Geographical Skills

### Content Distinctiveness

AQA's specification includes several distinctive content choices:

**Hazards focus**: AQA requires study of tectonic hazards, weather hazards, and climate change as a unifying theme. This provides clear progression from Key Stage 3 study of hazards and connects to contemporary issues of climate adaptation.

**Ecosystems emphasis**: The Living World topic includes both a small-scale UK ecosystem and a major world biome (hot deserts or tropical rainforests). This dual-scale approach supports understanding of processes at different scales.

**UK physical landscapes**: Students study two from coastal, river, and glacial landscapes. This choice allows departments to select landscapes relevant to their local context whilst ensuring all students study UK-specific geomorphology.

**Resource management**: Students specialise in one resource from food, water, or energy. This specialisation allows depth over breadth and enables departments to select resources most relevant to their students' interests and local contexts.

### Assessment Approach

AQA's assessment is characterised by:

- **Extended writing emphasis**: Significant marks allocated to 6-mark and 9-mark extended responses
- **Synoptic questioning**: Paper 3 Issue Evaluation requires students to draw together knowledge from across the specification
- **Skills integration**: Graphical, cartographic, and statistical skills are integrated throughout all papers
- **Fieldwork assessment**: Both familiar fieldwork (students' own experiences) and unfamiliar fieldwork contexts are assessed

The 9-mark 'Evaluate' question in Paper 1 and Paper 2 requires students to reach substantiated judgements, demonstrating higher-order geographical thinking.

### Fieldwork Requirements

AQA specifies that students must:

- Undertake two fieldwork enquiries outside the classroom
- One enquiry in a physical geography context
- One enquiry in a human geography context
- Collect primary data as part of these enquiries

The fieldwork must include exploration of physical and/or human processes and their interactions. While AQA provides extensive guidance on enquiry sequences, centres have flexibility in their specific fieldwork choices.

Common AQA fieldwork topics include:
- **Physical**: River processes and management, coastal processes and management, urban heat islands, microclimates
- **Human**: Urban regeneration, retail change, tourism impact, population characteristics

### Support and Resources

AQA provides extensive support including:
- Comprehensive specification and specimen materials
- Detailed fieldwork guidance documents
- Exemplar responses at different levels
- Online CPD and training events
- The AQA Geography Teachers' Facebook group (unofficial but widely used)

## Pearson Edexcel GCSE Geography

Pearson Edexcel offers two distinct GCSE Geography specifications: Specification A and Specification B. This dual-offering allows centres to select the approach that best fits their department's strengths and student needs.

### Edexcel GCSE Geography A

Specification A follows a thematic structure similar to AQA but with distinctive content emphases.

**Paper 1: The Physical Environment (37.5%)**
- Topic 1: The Changing Landscapes of the UK
- Topic 2: Weather Hazards and Climate Change
- Topic 3: Ecosystems, Biodiversity and Management

**Paper 2: The Human Environment (37.5%)**
- Topic 4: Changing Cities
- Topic 5: Global Development
- Topic 6: Resource Management

**Paper 3: Geographical Investigations: Fieldwork and UK Challenges (25%)**
- Topic 7: Geographical Investigations (fieldwork)
- Topic 8: UK Geographical Issues

### Edexcel GCSE Geography B

Specification B adopts an issues-based approach, organising content around contemporary geographical challenges.

**Paper 1: Global Geographical Issues (37.5%)**
- Topic 1: Hazardous Earth
- Topic 2: Development Dynamics
- Topic 3: Challenges of an Urbanising World

**Paper 2: UK Geographical Issues (37.5%)**
- Topic 4: The UK's Evolving Physical Landscape

- Topic 6: Geographical Investigations (fieldwork)

**Paper 3: People and Environment Issues – Making Geographical Decisions (25%)**
- Topic 7: People and the Biosphere
- Topic 8: Forests Under Threat
- Topic 9: Consuming Energy Resources

### Key Differences Between Edexcel A and B

**Structural approach**: Specification A separates physical and human geography into distinct papers. Specification B integrates UK content into Paper 2 whilst placing global issues in Paper 1.

**Content emphasis**: Specification B's Paper 3 focuses explicitly on environmental issues and resource management through a decision-making exercise. Specification A includes UK challenges within Paper 3 alongside fieldwork.

**Fieldwork placement**: In Specification A, fieldwork is Topic 7 in Paper 3 alongside UK challenges. In Specification B, fieldwork is Topic 6 within Paper 2 (UK Geographical Issues).

**Investigation requirement**: Specification B requires students to undertake two geographical investigations:
- One from either 'Coastal change and conflict' or 'River processes and pressures'
- One from either 'Dynamic urban areas' or 'Changing rural areas'

### Assessment Distinctiveness

Edexcel specifications feature several distinctive assessment approaches:

**Command word precision**: Edexcel has refined command words in recent years, with particular attention to 'explain' and 'suggest' questions. From June 2024, the board provided additional guidance on 4-mark questions with scaffolded responses.

**DME structure**: Specification B's Decision Making Exercise (Paper 3) is a distinctive feature, requiring students to evaluate options for managing environmental challenges. This synoptic assessment draws together knowledge from across the specification.

**Calculation emphasis**: Edexcel places particular emphasis on mathematical skills, with dedicated calculation questions across all papers.

**Structured responses**: Many questions include scaffolding (partial sentences, bullet points) to support students in developing extended responses.

### Fieldwork Requirements

Both Edexcel specifications require:

- Fieldwork undertaken outside the classroom on at least two occasions
- Investigation of both physical and human geography
- Collection of primary data

For Specification A, fieldwork is assessed through:
- Questions on students' own fieldwork (familiar fieldwork)
- Questions on unfamiliar fieldwork contexts
- Integration with UK challenges in Paper 3

For Specification B, the Geographical Investigations topic (Topic 6) requires:
- Understanding of the enquiry process
- Application to both physical and human investigations
- Assessment through Paper 2

Edexcel provides detailed fieldwork guides for both specifications, including guidance on conducting high-quality fieldwork at GCSE.

## OCR GCSE Geography

OCR offers two GCSE Geography specifications: Specification A (Geographical Themes) and Specification B (Geography for Enquiring Minds). OCR specifications are distinctive in their approach to content organisation and assessment.

### OCR GCSE Geography A (Geographical Themes)

**Paper 1: Living in the UK Today (40%)**
- Landscapes of the UK
- People of the UK
- UK Environmental Challenges

**Paper 2: The World Around Us (40%)**
- Ecosystems of the Planet
- People of the Planet
- Environmental Threats to Our Planet

**Paper 3: Geographical Skills (20%)**
- Geographical Skills
- Fieldwork

### OCR GCSE Geography B (Geography for Enquiring Minds)

**Paper 1: Our Natural World (35%)**

**Paper 2: People and Society (35%)**
- Urban Futures
- Dynamic Development
- UK in the 21st Century
- Resource Reliance

**Paper 3: Geographical Exploration (30%)**
- Geographical Skills
- Fieldwork
- Decision-making exercise

### OCR Distinctive Features

**Content organisation**: OCR A organises content thematically around UK and global scales. OCR B uses a more conceptual approach with explicit focus on futures and sustainability.

**Assessment weighting**: OCR A gives 40% weighting to both Paper 1 and Paper 2, with only 20% for Paper 3 (skills and fieldwork). OCR B follows the more common 35%-35%-30% distribution.

**Fieldwork approach**: OCR B requires fieldwork on at least two occasions in both physical and human geographical contexts outside the classroom. The specification emphasises the enquiry process explicitly.

**Synoptic element**: OCR B includes a decision-making exercise in Paper 3, similar to Edexcel B's DME. OCR A focuses more explicitly on skills assessment in Paper 3.

### Assessment Characteristics

OCR assessments are characterised by:

- **Clear structure**: Papers are organised into clearly defined sections with consistent question types
- **Skills emphasis**: Strong focus on graphical, cartographic, and statistical skills
- **Extended writing**: 8-mark extended response questions requiring developed reasoning
- **Fieldwork assessment**: Questions on both familiar and unfamiliar fieldwork contexts

OCR provides extensive support materials including specimen papers, mark schemes with indicative content, and examiner reports.

- **Edexcel**: Skills embedded throughout; mathematical skills given explicit focus
- **OCR**: Dedicated skills paper (OCR A) or integrated with decision-making (OCR B)

## Fieldwork Requirements in Detail

### DfE Minimum Requirements

All GCSE Geography fieldwork must:

1. **Take place outside the classroom**: Virtual fieldwork or classroom-based simulations do not meet requirements
2. **Occur on at least two occasions**: These may be part of the same day trip or separate visits
3. **Include both physical and human geography**: One investigation must address physical geography; one must address human geography
4. **Involve primary data collection**: Students must collect their own data; secondary data alone is insufficient
5. **Address processes and interactions**: Fieldwork should explore physical and/or human processes and their interactions

### Awarding Body Variations

**AQA**: Provides flexibility in topic choice whilst requiring clear enquiry sequences. Centres must complete a fieldwork statement confirming compliance.

**Edexcel**: Requires two distinct investigations. Specification B specifies investigation contexts (coastal/river and urban/rural). Provides detailed fieldwork guides.

**OCR**: Requires fieldwork in both physical and human contexts. Specification B explicitly links fieldwork to the enquiry process.

### Fieldwork Statement Requirements

Centres must complete a fieldwork statement for each cohort, confirming:
- All students have undertaken fieldwork outside the classroom
- Fieldwork includes both physical and human geography
- Primary data has been collected
- Fieldwork addresses the requirements of the specification

This statement is submitted to the awarding body and may be requested during inspection.

### Ofsted and Fieldwork

Ofsted's 2023 geography subject report highlighted that fieldwork is "paramount" to quality geography education. Inspectors evaluate:

- Whether fieldwork is embedded in curriculum planning
- The quality and variety of fieldwork experiences
- How fieldwork develops students' geographical understanding
- Whether fieldwork builds progression across key stages

Schools with strong fieldwork provision demonstrate:
- Clear rationale for fieldwork choices
- Integration with classroom learning
- Development of enquiry skills
- Opportunities for data collection, presentation, analysis, and evaluation

## Pedagogical Considerations

### Choosing a Specification

When selecting a GCSE specification, departments should consider:

**Curriculum continuity**: Which specification best aligns with Key Stage 3 curriculum and A-Level pathways?

**Staff expertise**: Which content areas match department strengths?

**Local context**: Which physical landscapes and human case studies are accessible for fieldwork?

**Student needs**: Which assessment structure best supports your student cohort?

**Resource availability**: What support materials, CPD, and exemplars are available?

### Teaching for Assessment

Regardless of specification, effective GCSE Geography teaching requires:

**Explicit skills instruction**: Cartographic, graphical, and statistical skills must be taught explicitly, not assumed from prior learning.

**Extended writing development**: Regular practice with 6-mark, 8-mark, and 9-mark questions using mark schemes and success criteria.

**Synoptic assessment preparation**: Students must practise making connections between topics, particularly for Paper 3-style assessments that require integrated geographical thinking.

**Fieldwork integration**: Fieldwork should not be treated as an isolated requirement but embedded throughout teaching to develop enquiry skills.

**Mathematical skills**: All specifications require mathematical skills at least at Key Stage 3 level; regular practice with percentages, ratios, and data analysis is essential.

### Synoptic Assessment Approaches

All specifications include synoptic assessment in some form, though the approach varies:

**AQA Issue Evaluation**: Students receive a pre-release booklet 12 weeks before the examination. This contains information about a contemporary geographical issue. The examination tests students' ability to analyse this information, draw on their wider geographical knowledge, and evaluate possible responses.

Teaching for Issue Evaluation requires:
- Regular practice with similar resource-based enquiries throughout the course
- Development of critical thinking skills to evaluate sources
- Understanding of how to integrate pre-release material with broader geographical knowledge
- Practice in reaching substantiated judgements based on evidence

**Edexcel B Decision Making Exercise**: Paper 3 presents students with an environmental management scenario requiring them to evaluate options and recommend a course of action. This tests similar skills to AQA's Issue Evaluation but with greater emphasis on decision-making processes.

**OCR B Decision-making exercise**: Similar to Edexcel B, requiring students to evaluate geographical information and make recommendations.

### Common Student Misconceptions

Across all specifications, certain misconceptions recur:

**Scale confusion**: Students often struggle to distinguish between local, national, and global scales of geographical processes. Effective teaching explicitly addresses scale and requires students to identify appropriate scales for different enquiries.

**Process vs outcome**: Students frequently describe geographical outcomes (e.g., "the river erodes the bank") without understanding the processes involved (hydraulic action, abrasion, etc.). Process-focused teaching addresses this gap.

**Place-specific vs generalised knowledge**: Students sometimes apply case study knowledge inappropriately, treating specific examples as universal. Teaching must distinguish between general geographical principles and place-specific characteristics.

**Fieldwork as experience vs enquiry**: Students often view fieldwork as a visit rather than an investigation. Explicit teaching of the enquiry cycle (questioning, planning, data collection, presentation, analysis, conclusion, evaluation) develops proper understanding.

**Command word misinterpretation**: Students frequently lose marks through misunderstanding command words. Systematic teaching of command words (describe, explain, evaluate, assess, compare) with exemplars addresses this issue.

### Progression from Key Stage 3

Effective GCSE teaching builds on Key Stage 3 foundations:

**Locational knowledge**: Building from basic place location at KS3 to more sophisticated understanding of interconnections between places at GCSE.

**Process understanding**: Developing from recognition of processes at KS3 to explanation of processes and their interactions at GCSE.

**Skills progression**: Extending from basic map and graph skills at KS3 to more complex analytical skills including GIS, statistical testing, and advanced cartography at GCSE.

**Enquiry development**: Building from structured enquiries at KS3 to more independent investigations at GCSE, preparing students for the complete enquiry cycle required for fieldwork.

### Specification Selection: Practical Guidance

When advising on specification choice, consider these practical factors:

**Department capacity for fieldwork**: Specifications differ in fieldwork flexibility. AQA offers greatest topic choice; Edexcel B specifies investigation contexts. Departments with limited fieldwork opportunities may prefer specifications offering more flexibility.

**Mathematics emphasis**: Edexcel specifications place greater explicit emphasis on mathematical skills. Departments confident in integrating mathematics may find this advantageous; others may prefer AQA or OCR.

**Synoptic assessment preference**: AQA's pre-release approach requires 12 weeks of preparation using provided materials. Edexcel B's DME is unseen in the examination. Different approaches suit different teaching styles and student needs.

**Textbook and resource availability**: AQA has the widest range of published resources due to market share. Edexcel and OCR have fewer resources but still adequate support.

**A-Level alignment**: Consider which specification best prepares students for your centre's A-Level provision. AQA GCSE aligns closely with AQA A-Level; Edexcel GCSE provides good foundation for Edexcel A-Level.

**CPD accessibility**: AQA offers the most extensive CPD programme due to candidate numbers, though all boards provide adequate training opportunities.

### Supporting Diverse Learners

All specifications must be accessible to the full ability range:

**Scaffolding extended writing**: Use writing frames, sentence starters, and structured planning tools to support students developing extended responses.

**Visual organisers**: Graphic organisers help students structure comparative and evaluative thinking required for higher-tariff questions.

**Tiered case studies**: Provide case studies at different levels of complexity, allowing all students to engage whilst enabling greater depth for more able students.

**Fieldwork differentiation**: Ensure fieldwork tasks can be completed by all students whilst offering extension opportunities for those ready for greater challenge.

**Regular retrieval practice**: Low-stakes quizzing supports knowledge retention for students of all abilities.

### Conclusion

The GCSE Geography specification landscape offers genuine choice whilst maintaining comparability through DfE requirements. No single specification is objectively 'best'; each has strengths suited to different contexts, department strengths, and student needs.

AQA's dominance reflects its clear structure, extensive resources, and flexibility. Edexcel's dual offering allows departments to choose between thematic (A) and issues-based (B) approaches. OCR provides distinctive alternatives with different assessment weightings and approaches.

The critical factor in specification success is not the choice itself but how well the selected specification is taught. All specifications reward:
- Thorough coverage of content with appropriate depth
- Explicit teaching of geographical skills
- Integration of fieldwork throughout the course
- Development of extended writing capabilities
- Preparation for synoptic thinking

Effective geography departments select specifications based on careful analysis of their context, teach the specification with appropriate pedagogical approaches, and continuously develop their practice through reflection, CPD, and engagement with the wider geography education community.

The statutory fieldwork requirement remains the defining practical element of all GCSE Geography courses. Ensuring high-quality fieldwork experiences that develop genuine enquiry skills, rather than merely meeting minimum requirements, distinguishes excellent geography provision. Ofsted's emphasis on fieldwork as "paramount" reflects its centrality to the discipline and its power to engage students with the real-world application of geographical thinking.

As the education landscape evolves, all awarding bodies continue to refine their specifications and assessment materials. Regular engagement with board updates, examiner reports, and subject-specific CPD ensures teachers remain current with developments and best positioned to support their students' success in GCSE Geography.
