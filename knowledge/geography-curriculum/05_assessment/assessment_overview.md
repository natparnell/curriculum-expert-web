# Assessment in Geography Education

## Introduction

Assessment in geography education serves multiple interconnected purposes: it informs teaching, supports pupil learning, provides accountability data, and enables curriculum evaluation. Since the removal of National Curriculum levels in 2014, geography departments and primary schools have developed diverse approaches to assessment that reflect the distinctive nature of geographical knowledge and skills. This resource examines the theoretical foundations, practical implementation, and current debates surrounding assessment in geography across all key stages.

## The Purposes of Assessment in Geography

### Formative Assessment: Assessment for Learning

Formative assessment, or Assessment for Learning (AfL), is the ongoing process of gathering evidence about pupil learning to inform and adapt teaching. Black and Wiliam's seminal research (1998) demonstrated that formative assessment practices can significantly raise attainment, particularly for lower-achieving pupils. In geography, formative assessment serves to:

- Identify pupils' prior knowledge and misconceptions about places, processes, and geographical concepts
- Provide feedback that moves learning forward, particularly regarding geographical thinking and enquiry skills
- Enable pupils to understand what quality geographical work looks like
- Support the development of metacognitive strategies for geographical investigation

The Geographical Association (GA) emphasises that effective formative assessment in geography involves "questioning, feedback, peer and self-assessment and formative use of summative tests" (GA, 2024). Gardner, Weeden and Butt (2015) provide comprehensive guidance on implementing these strategies within geographical contexts, including the use of geographical enquiries as vehicles for ongoing assessment.

### Summative Assessment: Assessment of Learning

Summative assessment evaluates pupil achievement at specific points, typically at the end of a unit, term, or key stage. In geography, summative assessment serves accountability functions while also providing information for progression decisions. Ofsted's geography subject report (2023) noted that "summative assessment was used well in most secondary schools," though it identified concerns about the quality and frequency of formative assessment in some settings.

Key purposes of summative assessment in geography include:

- Measuring achievement against curriculum objectives and assessment criteria
- Providing data for reporting to parents and external accountability measures
- Identifying patterns of strength and weakness to inform curriculum planning
- Preparing pupils for the assessment demands of GCSE and A-level qualifications

### Diagnostic Assessment

Diagnostic assessment occurs at the beginning of learning sequences to identify pupils' starting points. In geography, this might involve assessing:

- Prior knowledge of locations and place-specific information
- Understanding of key geographical concepts such as space, place, scale, and interdependence
- Existing skills in map reading, data interpretation, and geographical writing
- Misconceptions about physical and human processes

The GA recommends that secondary geography departments establish effective links with feeder primary schools to understand pupils' geographical learning. Some departments use the first unit of Year 7 as a diagnostic assessment, incorporating extended writing tasks that reveal pupils' capacity for geographical explanation and argumentation.

## Assessment Without Levels: The Post-2014 Landscape

### The Removal of National Curriculum Levels

The Commission on Assessment without Levels (2015) recommended the removal of National Curriculum levels, arguing that they had become overly complex and were being used inappropriately for in-school summative assessment. This change gave schools and geography departments significant freedom to design their own assessment approaches at Key Stages 1-3.

The Commission's final report emphasised that "different forms of assessment have different strengths and weaknesses" and that schools should develop assessment systems suited to their contexts and curriculum designs. For geography, this has meant developing approaches that:

- Reflect the distinctive nature of geographical knowledge and skills
- Enable progression to be tracked across the four National Curriculum strands
- Support pupils' development as geographers rather than merely measuring performance

### The GA Assessment and Progression Framework

In response to curriculum changes, the Geographical Association published "An Assessment and Progression Framework for Geography" (2016, updated). This framework addresses the GA's concern that the 2014 National Curriculum's emphasis on "locational and place knowledge, human and physical processes" might erode progression in curriculum and assessment planning.

The framework provides:

- Clear statements about end-of-Key Stage expectations for Key Stages 1-3
- A progression model that emphasises increasingly sophisticated geographical thinking
- Guidance on developing age-related expectations without reverting to numeric levels
- Approaches for formative and summative assessment that align with the framework

Hesslewood (2016) describes adopting a progression framework "that has no numbers on it," focusing instead on qualitative descriptions of developing geographical capability. Harris (2015) presents a "learning ladder" approach based on descriptive criteria rather than levels, enabling pupils to see their progression in geographical understanding.

### Approaches to Progression Tracking

Schools have developed varied approaches to tracking progression without levels:

**Learning Ladders and Progression Maps**: These describe what pupils should know and be able to do at different stages, using geographical language rather than generic level descriptors. The Oak National Academy curriculum provides such frameworks, mapping progress across key stages.

**GCSE Assessment Objectives at KS3**: Some three-year KS3 programmes use GCSE Assessment Objectives (AOs) to structure assessment. This approach aims to create coherent progression towards external examinations but risks narrowing the curriculum if applied too rigidly in earlier years.

**Mastery Approaches**: Some schools have adapted mastery models, identifying key geographical concepts and skills that pupils must secure before progressing. This works well for foundational knowledge but requires careful adaptation for geography's enquiry-based aspects.

## Assessment in Primary Geography

### Statutory Requirements and Non-Statutory Guidance

At Key Stages 1 and 2, geography is part of the statutory National Curriculum but does not have statutory assessment requirements beyond teacher assessment at the end of Key Stage 2 (which combines English, mathematics, and science). Schools are free to develop their own assessment approaches, guided by the GA's framework and the RGS's primary geography resources.

The Royal Geographical Society notes that "teachers and schools are free to use their own assessment methods in geography at Key Stages 1-3" but recommends using the GA progression documents to "benchmark progress across and between key stages" (RGS, 2024).

### Formative Assessment Strategies in Primary Geography

Effective formative assessment in primary geography includes:

**Talk and Discussion**: Geography provides rich opportunities for pupils to discuss places, processes, and issues. Teachers use talk to assess understanding and probe misconceptions about geographical concepts.

**Map and Atlas Work**: Regular opportunities to use maps enable teachers to assess developing spatial awareness and map skills. The progression from pictorial maps to Ordnance Survey maps provides clear developmental milestones.

**Fieldwork and Observation**: Primary geography fieldwork, whether in the school grounds or local area, generates evidence of pupils' geographical observation, questioning, and recording skills.

**Written and Drawn Work**: Pupils' written descriptions, annotated maps, and field sketches provide evidence of their geographical understanding and communication skills.

### The Primary Geography Quality Mark

The GA's Primary Geography Quality Mark (PGQM) provides a framework for evaluating and improving the quality of primary geography, including assessment practice. The award process involves:

- Self-evaluation against key indicators
- Moderation of assessment practice by expert geography educators
- Recognition of high-quality geography in schools

Schools working towards the PGQM develop assessment approaches that align with the GA's framework and demonstrate how assessment supports pupil progress in geography.

## Assessment in Secondary Geography

### Key Stage 3 Assessment

Ofsted (2013) expects "subject specialists to use assessment effectively to support the teaching of the curriculum and to serve student learning." At Key Stage 3, this involves:

**Regular Formative Assessment**: Ongoing assessment through questioning, classwork, and homework that provides feedback on geographical understanding and skills development.

**Assessment of Geographical Enquiry**: Evaluation of pupils' capacity to undertake geographical investigations, including framing questions, collecting and analysing data, and drawing conclusions.

**Progress Monitoring**: Tracking pupils' development across the four National Curriculum strands (locational knowledge, place knowledge, human and physical geography, geographical skills and fieldwork).

**Preparation for GCSE**: Ensuring that Key Stage 3 assessment develops the knowledge, skills, and understanding required for GCSE geography, without merely replicating GCSE assessment formats.

The GA's guidance on "Assessing Progress in Key Stage 3 Geography" provides resources and case studies showing how departments have developed effective assessment systems without levels.

### GCSE Assessment

GCSE geography assessment is determined by examination board specifications, with all specifications requiring:

**Written Examinations**: Assessing knowledge and understanding of physical and human geography topics, including case studies of specific places.

**Fieldwork Assessment**: All specifications require pupils to undertake fieldwork and be assessed on their fieldwork skills. The assessment approach varies:

- **AQA**: Fieldwork skills assessed through questions embedded in Paper 3 (Geographical Applications)
- **Edexcel**: Fieldwork assessed through the "Geographical Investigations" paper, which includes questions on both the pupils' own fieldwork and unseen fieldwork contexts
- **Eduqas**: Unique approach providing "methodological and conceptual frameworks for field enquiries in each assessment series"

**Assessment Objectives**: All GCSE specifications assess against common Assessment Objectives:

- AO1: Demonstrate knowledge of locations, places, processes, and environments
- AO2: Demonstrate geographical understanding of concepts and how they are used in relation to places and environments
- AO3: Apply knowledge and understanding to interpret, analyse, and evaluate geographical information and issues
- AO4: Use a range of geographical skills to investigate geographical questions and issues

### A-Level Assessment

A-level geography specifications require:

**Written Examinations**: Assessing advanced geographical knowledge, understanding, and skills across physical and human geography topics.

**Independent Investigation**: All specifications require pupils to undertake an Independent Investigation (NEA - Non-Examined Assessment), involving:

- Independent fieldwork and data collection
- Independent analysis and evaluation
- A written report of 3000-4000 words

The Independent Investigation assesses pupils' capacity to design and conduct geographical research independently, drawing on the fieldwork skills and methodologies developed throughout the course.

## Effective Assessment Practices in Geography

### Questioning Strategies

Effective questioning is fundamental to formative assessment in geography. Strategies include:

** hinge Questions**: Questions that check understanding at critical points in a lesson, enabling teachers to decide whether to move on or revisit material. In geography, these might check understanding of causal relationships in physical processes or the application of concepts to new contexts.

** Socratic Questioning**: Probing questions that develop geographical thinking by requiring pupils to clarify, justify, and extend their responses.

** Wait Time**: Providing adequate thinking time after asking questions, particularly for complex geographical enquiries requiring application of knowledge to new contexts.

### Feedback Practices

Effective feedback in geography:

- Focuses on the geographical learning, not just the task
- Identifies specific strengths and areas for development in pupils' geographical thinking
- Provides guidance on how to improve, including reference to models of quality geographical work
- Is manageable for teachers and actionable for pupils

The GA emphasises that feedback should "move learning forward" and that this often requires whole-class feedback on common issues alongside individual feedback on specific geographical thinking.

### Peer and Self-Assessment

Developing pupils' capacity for peer and self-assessment is particularly valuable in geography, where enquiry and argumentation are central. Approaches include:

- Using success criteria that describe quality geographical work
- Providing models and exemplars at different levels of achievement
- Structured peer feedback protocols for geographical enquiries
- Self-assessment of geographical skills and fieldwork competencies

### Assessment of Fieldwork

Fieldwork assessment presents particular challenges and opportunities:

** Skills Assessment**: Evaluating pupils' competence in fieldwork techniques, including sampling, data collection, and health and safety procedures.

** Enquiry Assessment**: Assessing pupils' capacity to design and conduct geographical investigations, including hypothesis formulation, methodology selection, and data presentation.

** Reflection Assessment**: Evaluating pupils' ability to evaluate their fieldwork and suggest improvements, developing metacognitive awareness of geographical investigation.

## Common Assessment Challenges in Geography

### Balancing Knowledge and Skills

A persistent challenge is assessing the full range of geographical learning, including both substantive knowledge (what geographers know) and disciplinary knowledge (how geographers think and work). Assessment systems that focus only on factual recall miss the distinctive contribution of geography's enquiry-based approach.

### Managing Assessment Burden

Ofsted's geography subject report (2023) identified that "limited formative assessment was taking place, even when leaders believed that this was happening regularly." This often reflects the assessment burden on teachers. Effective geography departments design assessment systems that:

- Generate rich information without excessive marking
- Use a range of assessment formats (oral, written, practical)
- Focus teacher assessment on key geographical learning
- Involve pupils in self- and peer-assessment

### Ensuring Progression

Without National Curriculum levels, ensuring progression in assessment requires:

- Clear understanding of how geographical thinking develops
- Regular moderation within and between departments
- Use of the GA's progression framework or equivalent
- Attention to the transition between key stages, particularly from primary to secondary

### Preparing for Examinations Without Narrowing the Curriculum

At Key Stage 4 and 5, there is a risk that assessment becomes dominated by examination preparation. Effective geography departments:

- Maintain a broad geographical curriculum alongside examination preparation
- Use assessment to develop geographical thinking, not just examination technique
- Ensure fieldwork serves educational purposes beyond assessment requirements
- Develop pupils' geographical independence, not just their capacity to answer examination questions

## Current Developments and Future Directions

### The Curriculum and Assessment Review

The government's Review of Curriculum and Assessment (2024-25) includes consideration of geography. The GA's response, informed by over 400 teachers, emphasises the importance of:

- High-quality geography for all pupils across Key Stages 1-3
- Assessment that supports the distinctive nature of geographical learning
- Recognition of geography's contribution to pupils' understanding of the world and their place within it

### Digital Assessment Tools

Technology offers opportunities for assessment in geography, including:

- GIS-based assessment of spatial understanding
- Online fieldwork data collection and analysis
- Digital portfolios documenting geographical learning over time
- Adaptive assessment tools that respond to pupil performance

However, technology should serve geographical learning rather than drive assessment design.

### Research-Informed Practice

The geography education research community continues to inform assessment practice, with recent work focusing on:

- The assessment of geographical thinking and enquiry
- Progression in specific geographical concepts
- The relationship between assessment and curriculum design
- Effective feedback practices in geographical contexts

Teachers and departments can access research summaries through the GA's journals and conference proceedings, supporting evidence-informed assessment development.

## Conclusion

Assessment in geography education has evolved significantly since the removal of National Curriculum levels. The freedom to design context-appropriate assessment systems has enabled innovation, but it has also required departments and schools to develop assessment literacy and to engage seriously with what it means to assess geographical learning effectively.

The Geographical Association's frameworks and guidance, alongside the examination specifications at Key Stages 4 and 5, provide structure for assessment development. Ultimately, effective assessment in geography serves learning: it helps pupils understand what it means to think geographically, provides teachers with information to adapt their teaching, and enables schools to evaluate and improve their geography curricula.

As Ofsted's geography subject report emphasised, the quality of assessment matters more than its quantity. Geography departments and primary teachers should focus on assessment practices that genuinely illuminate and advance pupils' geographical learning, rather than on generating data for its own sake. This requires ongoing professional development, moderation, and engagement with the geography education community's shared expertise.
