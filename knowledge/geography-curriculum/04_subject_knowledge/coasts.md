# Coasts and Coastal Management

## Overview

Coastal geography represents one of the most dynamic and engaging topics within the UK geography curriculum, offering students tangible connections between physical processes, human management decisions, and real-world controversies. The study of coasts encompasses the interaction between marine and terrestrial environments, examining how waves, tides, and currents shape the coastline, and how human societies respond to the challenges and opportunities presented by coastal environments.

Within the National Curriculum for Geography, coastal studies feature prominently at Key Stage 3, where pupils are expected to understand "physical geography relating to coasts," and at GCSE level, where coastal landscapes constitute a major optional unit across all examination board specifications. The topic provides exceptional opportunities for fieldwork, enabling students to observe processes firsthand, collect primary data, and engage with contemporary management debates.

The UK coastline spans approximately 11,073 miles (17,820 kilometres) when measured at the Ordnance Survey 1:10,000 scale, presenting extraordinary diversity from the towering cliffs of Scotland and Cornwall to the shifting salt marshes of East Anglia and the engineered sea walls protecting major coastal towns.

## Wave Processes and Coastal Energy

### Understanding Wave Formation

Waves represent the primary mechanism through which energy is transferred from wind to the coastline. The Geographical Association (2023) emphasises that students must understand wave generation before they can comprehend coastal processes. Wave formation depends upon three key factors: wind speed, wind duration, and fetch—the distance of open water over which wind blows.

**Fetch** represents a critical concept. The longer the fetch, the greater the distance waves have to build up energy and height. This explains why the west coast of the British Isles, exposed to the full fetch of the Atlantic Ocean stretching over 3,000 miles, experiences significantly larger and more powerful waves than the east coast.

### Constructive and Destructive Waves

**Constructive waves** occur in calm conditions:
- Low wave height (under 1 metre)
- Long wavelength (exceeding 10 metres)
- Low wave frequency (fewer than 10 waves per minute)
- Powerful swash exceeds backwash
- Net movement of sediment up the beach

**Destructive waves** form under storm conditions:
- High wave height (exceeding 1 metre)
- Short wavelength (less than 10 metres)
- High wave frequency (more than 13 waves per minute)
- Weak swash, powerful backwash
- Net removal of beach material

The Royal Geographical Society (2023) notes that teaching students to recognise these wave types through photographs, video footage, and field observations significantly enhances understanding.

## Coastal Erosion Processes

### Hydraulic Action

Waves compress air in cracks, exerting forces exceeding 30 tonnes per square metre, gradually enlarging cracks and weakening rock structure. This process is most powerful at cliff bases.

### Abrasion

Waves hurl rock fragments against the coastline, grinding away rock like sandpaper. Effectiveness depends on material hardness, sediment concentration, wave velocity, and coastal rock resistance.

### Attrition

Rock fragments collide, becoming smaller, rounder, and smoother. As attrition reduces particle size, sediment becomes more susceptible to longshore drift transport.

### Solution

Seawater chemically weathers soluble rocks like limestone and chalk. Ocean acidification may increase this process in coming decades.

## Coastal Landforms of Erosion

### Headlands and Bays

Differential erosion creates alternating resistant headlands and less resistant bays. Headlands experience concentrated wave energy through refraction; bays accumulate beaches where energy is reduced.

The Geographical Association recommends the Dorset coast as an exemplar: Lulworth Cove, Stair Hole, and Durdle Door demonstrate these principles.

### Caves, Arches, Stacks, and Stumps

1. **Caves** form where hydraulic action exploits weaknesses
2. **Arches** develop when caves break through headlands
3. **Stacks** form when arch roofs collapse (e.g., Old Harry Rocks, Bedruthan Steps)
4. **Stumps** remain when stacks undercut and collapse

Old Harry's Wife collapsed in 1896, demonstrating coastal change within historical time.

### Wave-Cut Platforms

Flat rocky platforms at sea level formed through cliff base erosion. Platform width influences erosion rates—narrow platforms allow direct wave attack, while wide platforms dissipate energy.

## Coastal Transportation and Deposition

### Longshore Drift

Sediment moves in a zigzag pattern: swash carries material at the wave angle, backwash returns it perpendicular to the coast. Direction can change seasonally. Interfering with this process (e.g., through groynes) affects down-drift beaches.

### Coastal Deposition Landforms

**Spits:** Form when longshore drift crosses coastline changes. Orford Ness (Suffolk) extends 10+ miles. Hurst Castle Spit (Hampshire) has medieval structures.

**Bars:** Spits that close off bays creating lagoons. Slapton Sands (Devon) creates Slapton Ley lagoon.

**Tombolos:** Bars connecting islands to mainland. Chesil Beach (Dorset) connects Isle of Portland—18 miles of shingle beach.

## Coastal Management Strategies

The UK faces significant challenges: 30% of England's coastline experiences active erosion. Shoreline Management Plans provide strategic frameworks over 100-year timescales.

### Hard Engineering

**Sea walls:** Reflective, £5,000–£10,000/m, require maintenance. Examples: Blackpool, Southend-on-Sea, Brighton. Reflected energy can scour beaches.

**Groynes:** Trap sediment up-drift, deplete down-drift. Brighton seafront maintains tourism beaches while causing erosion further east.

**Rock armour:** Boulders absorbing wave energy. Environmentally intrusive but flexible.

**Gabions:** Wire cages with rock. Cheaper but less durable.

**Revetments:** Sloping structures absorbing energy. Appropriate for low-lying coasts.

### Soft Engineering

**Beach nourishment:** Adding sand/shingle. Bournemouth's programme maintains beaches at lower cost than hard engineering. Requires periodic replenishment.

**Dune regeneration:** Planting marram grass with fencing and boardwalks.

**Managed realignment:** Controlled retreat creating intertidal habitats. Medmerry (West Sussex): £28 million, 470 acres habitat, 348 properties protected. Completed 2013.

### Shoreline Management Plans

Four approaches:
1. **Hold the line:** Maintain existing defences
2. **Advance the line:** Build seaward (rarely used)
3. **Managed realignment:** Controlled retreat
4. **No active intervention:** Allow natural evolution

Happisburgh (Norfolk) demonstrates tensions: "no active intervention" caused property value collapse and community displacement.

## Teaching Approaches

### Progression Across Key Stages

**KS2:** Focus on places, basic concepts, observation
**KS3:** Process understanding, local case studies, fieldwork
**GCSE:** Systems, evaluation, stakeholder perspectives
**A-Level:** Dynamic systems, sediment cells, political dimensions

### Fieldwork

- Beach profiling
- Sediment analysis
- Defence evaluation
- Erosion measurement
- Stakeholder surveys

### Common Misconceptions

- Waves transfer energy, not water mass
- Not all waves are the same
- Hard engineering is not always best
- Sea level varies locally
- Coastal change can be rapid
