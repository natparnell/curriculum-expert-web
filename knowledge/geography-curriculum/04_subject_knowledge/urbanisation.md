# Urbanisation and Urban Issues

This knowledge file covers urban growth processes, the emergence of megacities, urban challenges in both the UK and in Low-Income Countries (LICs) and Newly Emerging Economies (NEEs), and approaches to urban sustainability. It is designed to support geography teachers in delivering comprehensive, progressive urban geography across Key Stages 3 to 5, with clear pedagogical approaches and common pupil misconceptions addressed throughout.

## What is Urbanisation?

### Defining the Process

Urbanisation refers to the increasing proportion of a country's population living in towns and cities. It is a fundamental human geographical process that has transformed human settlement patterns over the past two centuries. The process involves two key components: rural-urban migration (people moving from countryside to cities) and natural increase in urban areas (births exceeding deaths in cities).

The United Nations estimates that by 2008, for the first time in human history, more than half the world's population lived in urban areas. By 2050, this figure is projected to reach 68%, representing an additional 2.5 billion urban dwellers. This represents one of the most significant demographic shifts in human history, with profound implications for resource consumption, environmental sustainability, and social organisation.

### Historical Patterns of Urbanisation

The process of urbanisation unfolded differently across the world. In High-Income Countries (HICs), particularly in Europe and North America, rapid urbanisation accompanied the Industrial Revolution from the late 18th century onwards. Cities such as Manchester, Birmingham, and London grew exponentially as rural populations sought employment in factories and mills.

By contrast, most Low-Income Countries (LICs) and Newly Emerging Economies (NEEs) began urbanising much later, often only gaining momentum after the Second World War. This delayed but accelerated pattern means that many developing countries are experiencing urban growth rates far exceeding those seen historically in HICs. The urban population of Africa is projected to triple between 2010 and 2050, representing one of the fastest urban transitions in human history.

## Causes of Urbanisation

### Push Factors from Rural Areas

Push factors are negative conditions that drive people away from rural areas. These include:

**Economic factors:** Rural poverty, limited employment opportunities beyond subsistence farming, declining agricultural commodity prices, and mechanisation reducing the need for agricultural labour. In many LICs, the Green Revolution of the 1960s-70s increased agricultural productivity but displaced millions of rural workers who subsequently migrated to cities.

**Environmental factors:** Drought, desertification, soil erosion, and climate change impacts reducing agricultural viability. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that climate-induced displacement will increasingly drive rural-urban migration, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

**Social factors:** Limited access to education and healthcare in rural areas, ethnic or religious conflict, and lack of infrastructure such as electricity and clean water.

### Pull Factors to Urban Areas

Pull factors are positive attractions that draw people toward cities:

**Economic opportunities:** Employment in manufacturing, services, and the informal economy. Cities concentrate economic activity, offering higher wages and diverse livelihood opportunities. Even when formal employment is scarce, cities offer more diverse informal economic possibilities than rural areas.

**Services and amenities:** Better access to healthcare, education, electricity, water supply, sanitation, and entertainment. Major hospitals and universities are overwhelmingly concentrated in urban centres.

**Social and cultural factors:** The perception of urban life as modern and desirable, freedom from traditional rural social constraints, and the presence of family members or community networks already established in cities.

### Understanding Migration Decision-Making

Lee's Push-Pull Theory (1966) remains a foundational framework for understanding migration decisions, though contemporary geographers recognise that migration is rarely a simple response to push and pull factors. Migration decisions involve weighing multiple factors, including the costs and risks of migration, the presence of intervening obstacles (such as distance or borders), and individual and household circumstances.

The concept of **cumulative causation** helps explain how urbanisation becomes self-reinforcing: as more people move to cities, urban economies grow, services improve, and more people are attracted, while rural areas experience further relative decline.

## The Rise of Megacities

### Defining and Measuring Megacities

A megacity is defined by the United Nations as an urban agglomeration with a population of 10 million or more inhabitants. This threshold was first crossed in 1950 by New York City; by 2023, there were approximately 34 megacities worldwide, with projections suggesting 43 by 2030.

Megacities can be distinguished from **millionaire cities** (cities with over 1 million people) and **world cities** (cities with significant global economic and political influence). Some cities, such as London and Tokyo, qualify under all three categories, while others, such as Lagos or Dhaka, are megacities without yet achieving equivalent global influence.

### The Geography of Megacities

As of 2023, the majority of megacities are located in Asia (Tokyo, Delhi, Shanghai, Dhaka, Karachi, Istanbul, Mumbai, Beijing, Osaka, Chongqing), with significant concentrations also in Latin America (São Paulo, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro) and Africa (Cairo, Lagos, Kinshasa). Only two megacities (New York and Los Angeles) are located in North America.

This distribution reflects the contemporary geography of global population and economic growth. While HICs urbanised earlier and established large cities then, the fastest urban growth now occurs in NEEs and LICs. Tokyo remains the world's largest urban agglomeration with approximately 37 million people, though Delhi is projected to overtake it by 2028.

### Characteristics of Megacities

Megacities exhibit several distinctive characteristics that differentiate them from smaller urban centres:

**Economic primacy:** Megacities typically dominate the economies of their countries, often generating a disproportionate share of national GDP. São Paulo, for example, accounts for approximately 10% of Brazil's population but generates over 20% of its GDP.

**Complex social geographies:** Megacities contain extreme socioeconomic diversity, often with wealthy districts and informal settlements existing in close proximity. This spatial juxtaposition of wealth and poverty is a defining feature of many megacities in the developing world.

**Governance challenges:** Providing infrastructure, services, and security for populations exceeding 10 million presents extraordinary governance challenges. Many megacities span multiple administrative jurisdictions, complicating coordinated planning.

**Environmental footprints:** Megacities consume vast quantities of resources and generate significant pollution. However, their density can also enable more efficient resource use per capita compared to dispersed settlement patterns.

### Emerging Megacities and Future Projections

Urban demographers identify several rapidly growing cities likely to achieve megacity status by 2035-2040, including Ahmedabad (India), Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam), and Luanda (Angola). The emergence of new megacities represents both opportunities for economic development and significant challenges for sustainable urban management.

## Urban Challenges in LICs and NEEs

### The Growth of Informal Settlements

The most visible manifestation of rapid urbanisation in LICs and NEEs is the proliferation of informal settlements—variously called favelas (Brazil), barrios (Venezuela), shanty towns (Kenya, South Africa), or bustees (India). The UN-Habitat estimates that approximately 1 billion people worldwide live in informal settlements, with this number projected to reach 3 billion by 2050.

Informal settlements are characterised by:
- Self-built housing using available materials (corrugated iron, wood, plastic sheeting)
- Lack of formal land tenure or property rights
- Absence of planned infrastructure (paved roads, sewage systems, piped water)
- Limited or no government services (waste collection, street lighting, postal delivery)
- Location on marginal land (steep hillsides, floodplains, industrial wasteland, close to transport infrastructure)

### Living Conditions in Informal Settlements

Despite significant variation between and within settlements, residents of informal settlements commonly face:

**Inadequate shelter:** Housing is often structurally precarious, vulnerable to fire, flooding, and landslides. In Mumbai's Dharavi, one of Asia's largest informal settlements, an estimated 500,000 people live in approximately 2 square kilometres, with population densities exceeding 300,000 people per square kilometre.

**Limited access to basic services:** Water may be available for only a few hours daily, delivered through communal taps. Sanitation is often absent or inadequate, with open sewers and pit latrines creating serious health hazards.

**Health risks:** The combination of overcrowding, poor sanitation, and limited healthcare access creates high vulnerability to infectious diseases. Respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, and tuberculosis are endemic in many informal settlements.

**Economic vulnerability:** While informal settlements often host vibrant informal economies, residents typically lack job security, labour protections, and social safety nets.

**Social challenges:** Informal settlements can experience high crime rates, substance abuse, and gender-based violence, though these stereotypes often overstate problems while overlooking community strengths and resilience.

### Case Study: Rocinha, Rio de Janeiro

Rocinha is Brazil's largest favela, located in Rio de Janeiro's South Zone between the wealthy districts of São Conrado and Gávea. With an estimated population of 150,000-200,000 residents, it illustrates both the challenges and the dynamism of informal settlements.

**Challenges:** Rocinha has historically faced violence related to drug trafficking, limited government service provision, and environmental risks including flooding and landslides. The steep topography makes infrastructure installation difficult and expensive.

**Strengths:** Rocinha possesses a highly developed internal economy with over 6,000 businesses, banks, healthcare facilities, and community organisations. Residents have developed sophisticated informal governance structures and community-led improvement initiatives. The favela's location adjacent to wealthy neighbourhoods enables some residents to access formal employment as domestic workers, security guards, and service workers.

### Urban Services and Infrastructure Deficits

Beyond housing, rapidly urbanising cities in LICs and NEEs face acute infrastructure deficits:

**Transport:** Most megacities in the developing world lack adequate public transport systems. Traffic congestion costs economies billions in lost productivity. Delhi loses an estimated 4-5% of its GDP annually to traffic congestion.

**Water and sanitation:** The World Bank estimates that 700 million urban residents globally lack access to improved sanitation facilities. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 25% of urban households are connected to sewerage networks.

**Waste management:** Many rapidly growing cities lack formal waste collection systems. Lagos generates approximately 13,000 tonnes of waste daily but can only collect and process 40% of this volume.

**Energy:** Unreliable electricity supplies constrain economic development. Load shedding (planned power outages) remains common in cities across South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

### Environmental Challenges

Urban areas in LICs and NEEs face severe environmental challenges:

**Air pollution:** Rapidly growing cities with increasing vehicle ownership, industrial activity, and energy generation often experience dangerous air quality. The World Health Organisation estimates that 9 out of 10 people globally breathe polluted air, with the highest exposures in developing country cities.

**Water pollution:** Inadequate sewage treatment and industrial waste disposal contaminate urban water bodies. The Yamuna River flowing through Delhi receives approximately 800 million litres of untreated sewage daily.

**Climate vulnerability:** Many rapidly growing cities are located in coastal zones vulnerable to sea-level rise and storm surges (Miami, Mumbai, Jakarta, Lagos), floodplains (Dhaka, Kinshasa), or areas of seismic risk (Mexico City, Istanbul, Tehran).

## Urban Challenges in the UK

### Deindustrialisation and Urban Decline

Unlike cities in LICs and NEEs facing the challenges of rapid growth, many UK cities have experienced the challenges of economic restructuring and population loss. Deindustrialisation—the decline of manufacturing industry—profoundly affected UK cities from the 1970s onwards.

Cities such as Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield, and Glasgow lost significant population as manufacturing employment collapsed. Between 1971 and 2001, Liverpool's population declined from 610,000 to 440,000—a loss of over 25%. This population loss created a distinctive set of urban challenges:

- **Housing market collapse:** Depopulation left extensive areas of vacant and derelict housing, particularly in inner-city terraces built for industrial workers.
- **Economic deprivation:** Loss of manufacturing employment created concentrated unemployment and poverty.
- **Social fragmentation:** Population turnover disrupted community structures and social networks.
- **Physical dereliction:** Factory closures left contaminated industrial land (brownfield sites) and obsolete infrastructure.

### Contemporary Urban Challenges

Despite significant regeneration investment (discussed below), UK cities continue to face challenges:

**Housing affordability:** Many UK cities, particularly London and the South East, face acute housing affordability crises. The ratio of median house prices to median earnings in London exceeds 13:1, among the highest globally. This creates difficulties for younger people entering the housing market and drives social segregation.

**Inequality and segregation:** UK cities exhibit pronounced spatial segregation by income, ethnicity, and social class. Indices of Multiple Deprivation identify concentrated pockets of deprivation within otherwise prosperous cities. The 2011 England riots highlighted the persistence of urban alienation and deprivation.

**Environmental quality:** Air pollution exceeds legal limits in many UK cities. London exceeded annual legal limits for nitrogen dioxide within the first month of 2018. Climate change adaptation presents growing challenges, including flood risk management and urban heat island effects.

**Infrastructure capacity:** Transport congestion, particularly in London and major regional cities, constrains economic productivity. The UK's infrastructure investment as a proportion of GDP lags behind comparable European countries.

### Case Study: Urban Change in London

London exemplifies both the opportunities and challenges of urban life in a HIC. As a global city, London generates approximately 22% of UK GDP and attracts international investment and talent. However, London also faces:

- **Housing crisis:** Average house prices exceed £500,000, and private rents consume over 50% of median income for many households.
- **Social polarisation:** The coexistence of extreme wealth (Knightsbridge, Mayfair) and deprivation (Tower Hamlets, Newham) within the same city.
- **Environmental pressures:** Air quality violations, pressure on green space, and climate vulnerability (flood risk, heatwaves).
- **Infrastructure strain:** Overcrowded transport networks and delayed major infrastructure projects (Heathrow expansion, Crossrail 2).

## Urban Regeneration and Sustainability

### Approaches to Urban Regeneration

Urban regeneration refers to efforts to reverse economic, social, and physical decline in urban areas. UK regeneration has evolved through several phases:

**Property-led regeneration (1980s):** The Thatcher government established Urban Development Corporations (UDCs) with powers to acquire land, grant planning permissions, and invest in infrastructure. The London Docklands Development Corporation transformed former docklands into a new financial district (Canary Wharf) and residential areas. Critics argue this approach prioritised physical development over social needs and excluded local communities from decision-making.

**Partnership and community involvement (1990s):** The Single Regeneration Budget and New Deal for Communities emphasised partnerships between public, private, and voluntary sectors, with greater community involvement. Sheffield's regeneration following steel industry collapse exemplified this approach.

**Sustainable communities (2000s-present):** Current approaches emphasise creating "sustainable communities" that are environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable. The Manchester Northern Quarter regeneration illustrates mixed-use development combining housing, employment, culture, and public space.

### Case Study: Stratford and the London 2012 Olympics

The London 2012 Olympic Games catalysed one of the UK's largest urban regeneration projects. The Lower Lea Valley, one of England's most deprived areas, was transformed to host the Games and subsequently converted to residential, commercial, and parkland use.

**Physical transformation:** Contaminated industrial land was remediated; new housing, schools, and healthcare facilities were constructed; transport infrastructure was upgraded (Stratford International Station, DLR extension).

**Social outcomes:** The regeneration created employment and training opportunities for local residents, though critics question whether benefits reached the most disadvantaged communities.

**Legacy:** The Olympic Park (now the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park) provides 560 acres of parkland, and the former Athletes' Village was converted to affordable housing. The regeneration accelerated Stratford's transition from a deprived post-industrial area to a major metropolitan centre.

### Sustainable Urban Development

Sustainable urban development seeks to meet present needs without compromising future generations' ability to meet their needs. Key principles include:

**Compact city model:** Concentrating development in existing urban areas rather than peripheral greenfield sites reduces land take, enables efficient public transport, and preserves green space.

**Mixed-use development:** Combining residential, commercial, and recreational uses reduces travel distances and creates vibrant communities.

**Sustainable transport:** Prioritising walking, cycling, and public transport over private vehicle use reduces emissions and congestion. London's congestion charge (introduced 2003) and Ultra Low Emission Zone (expanded 2023) exemplify demand management approaches.

**Green infrastructure:** Urban parks, green roofs, sustainable drainage systems (SuDS), and urban forests provide multiple benefits including biodiversity, flood management, air quality improvement, and urban cooling.

**Circular economy:** Designing urban systems to minimise waste and maximise resource recycling. Bristol's aspirations to become a circular city illustrate this approach.

### Approaches in LICs and NEEs

Sustainable urban development in rapidly growing cities presents distinctive challenges:

**Informal settlement upgrading:** Rather than clearance, many cities now pursue incremental upgrading of informal settlements—paving lanes, installing water and sanitation, regularising tenure. The Orangi Pilot Project in Karachi demonstrated that community-led sanitation upgrading can achieve significant improvements at low cost.

**Transit-oriented development:** Cities such as Curitiba (Brazil) and Bogotá (Colombia) developed Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems providing efficient, affordable public transport. Curitiba's BRT, introduced in 1974, carries approximately 2 million passengers daily and has shaped the city's linear development pattern.

**Smart city technologies:** Some rapidly growing cities are leapfrogging to smart city technologies—digital monitoring and management of urban systems. Nairobi's adoption of mobile payment systems (M-Pesa) for utility bills illustrates technology-enabled service improvements.

## Pedagogical Approaches to Teaching Urban Geography

### Progression Across Key Stages

Teaching urban geography effectively requires careful attention to progression from Key Stage 3 through to A Level:

**Key Stage 3 (Ages 11-14):** Focus on developing foundational understanding of urbanisation as a process, using accessible case studies such as Rio de Janeiro (NEE) and contrasting cities in the UK. Emphasise the human experiences behind statistics—why people move, what life is like in different urban environments. Use visual resources extensively: photographs, videos, virtual fieldwork, and interactive maps.

**GCSE (Ages 14-16):** Develop greater conceptual sophistication. Introduce the distinction between HICs, NEEs, and LICs. Require detailed case study knowledge of one UK city and one city in a NEE or LIC. Develop skills in interpreting urban data, including population pyramids, population density maps, and land use models.

**A Level (Ages 16-18):** Engage with theoretical perspectives on urbanisation, including world systems theory, post-colonial critiques of urban development models, and political ecology approaches to urban environmental challenges. Explore contemporary debates about planetary urbanisation, smart cities, and the right to the city.

### Common Pupil Misconceptions

Effective urban geography teaching must address common misconceptions:

**Misconception: "All slums/favelas are terrible places where no one would choose to live."**
Correction: While informal settlements face significant challenges, they are also vibrant communities where people build livelihoods, social networks, and cultural lives. Many residents have lived in the same settlement for generations and have strong attachments to place. Avoid "poverty tourism" approaches that present only misery and deprivation.

**Misconception: "Urbanisation is always bad for the environment."**
Correction: While rapid urban growth creates environmental pressures, cities can also enable resource-efficient living through density, public transport, and shared infrastructure. The environmental impact depends critically on urban form, governance, and technology.

**Misconception: "People in LICs move to cities because they don't know any better."**
Correction: Migration decisions are rational responses to structural conditions—rural poverty, limited opportunities, and the genuine attractions of urban life. Migrants are typically pursuing better lives for themselves and their families, not making ignorant choices.

**Misconception: "The UK doesn't have urban problems like developing countries."**
Correction: While the nature of urban challenges differs, UK cities face serious issues including housing affordability, inequality, environmental quality, and infrastructure capacity. Comparing UK and developing country cities can illuminate both differences and unexpected similarities.

### Effective Teaching Strategies

**Enquiry-based learning:** Structure urban geography around enquiry questions such as "Why are so many people moving to Lagos?" or "How sustainable is London's transport system?" This promotes active engagement and develops geographical thinking.

**Case study depth and breadth:** Balance detailed knowledge of specific cities with broader understanding of urban processes across contexts. The Geographical Association recommends studying at least one UK and one global city at GCSE, with contrasting economic development contexts.

**Visual and multimedia resources:** Urban geography lends itself to rich visual teaching. Use documentary films (such as those exploring life in favelas), drone footage, virtual reality fieldwork, and interactive mapping platforms such as Google Earth and Urban Observatory.

**Contemporary relevance:** Urban geography is constantly changing. Incorporate current events—climate disasters affecting cities, urban protests, policy changes—into teaching to maintain relevance and engagement.

**Fieldwork opportunities:** Where possible, undertake urban fieldwork in local towns and cities. Even smaller UK towns demonstrate urban processes and can be analysed using the same frameworks applied to megacities.

## Summary

Urbanisation represents one of the defining processes of our age, transforming where and how billions of people live. Teaching urban geography effectively requires engaging with both the statistical scale of urban change and the human experiences behind the numbers.

Key takeaways for geography teachers:

1. **Context matters:** Urbanisation unfolds differently in HICs, NEEs, and LICs. Avoid one-size-fits-all models and attend to specific historical, economic, and political contexts.

2. **Complexity not caricature:** Informal settlements face serious challenges but are also sites of community, economic activity, and cultural vitality. Present nuanced portrayals that respect residents' agency.

3. **Interconnectedness:** Urban geography connects to virtually every other geographical theme—climate, development, globalisation, hazards, sustainability. Make these connections explicit.

4. **Contemporary relevance:** Urban processes are unfolding now. Connect teaching to current events and ongoing urban transformations.

5. **Critical perspectives:** Encourage students to question whose interests urban development serves, and to consider alternative visions of urban futures.

By developing deep knowledge of urban processes, comparative case studies, and pedagogical strategies for addressing misconceptions, geography teachers can prepare students to understand and engage with the urban world they inhabit and will inherit.
