# Weather, Climate and Climate Change

## Overview

Weather, climate and climate change represent foundational concepts in geographical education, forming a core component of the National Curriculum for Geography and GCSE specifications across all examination boards. This knowledge domain encompasses atmospheric processes that govern global weather patterns, the distinctive characteristics of the UK's maritime climate, and the pressing contemporary challenge of anthropogenic climate change. Effective teaching of this topic requires pupils to understand the difference between weather and climate, comprehend the tricellular model of atmospheric circulation, analyse the factors influencing UK weather patterns, and engage critically with the causes, evidence and responses to climate change.

The Royal Meteorological Society's Curriculum for Climate Literacy (2024) emphasises that climate change education must move beyond simple factual transmission to develop genuine climate literacy—enabling pupils to understand the science, evaluate evidence, appreciate the geopolitical complexities, and consider appropriate responses at individual, local, national and international scales. The Geographical Association similarly stresses the importance of justice-focused climate change education that empowers pupils as informed citizens rather than merely alarming them with catastrophic narratives.

## Distinctions Between Weather and Climate

### Defining Weather

Weather refers to the short-term state of the atmosphere at a specific place and time, encompassing variables including temperature, precipitation, humidity, air pressure, wind speed and direction, and cloud cover. Weather conditions can change rapidly—within minutes or hours—and are highly variable both spatially and temporally. The Met Office defines weather as "what you experience when you step outside"—the immediate atmospheric conditions that determine whether you need an umbrella, sunscreen or warm clothing.

Key weather elements that pupils should understand include:

- **Temperature**: Measured in degrees Celsius, reflecting the kinetic energy of air molecules
- **Precipitation**: Water falling from the atmosphere in liquid (rain, drizzle) or solid (snow, hail, sleet) form
- **Humidity**: The amount of water vapour present in the air, typically expressed as relative humidity
- **Air pressure**: The weight of air pressing down on the Earth's surface, measured in millibars
- **Wind**: The horizontal movement of air from high to low pressure areas
- **Cloud cover**: The fraction of sky obscured by clouds, expressed in oktas (eighths)

### Defining Climate

Climate represents the average weather conditions of a place over a significant period—typically 30 years or more, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization. Climate encompasses not only average conditions but also the variability, extremes and seasonal patterns that characterise a location. As the old saying has it: "Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get."

The National Curriculum requires pupils to understand climate at multiple scales:

- **Microclimate**: Local climatic conditions in small areas (a garden, school playground, urban canyon)
- **Local climate**: Conditions across a town or small region
- **Regional climate**: Characteristic weather patterns of larger areas (e.g., Mediterranean climate, British maritime climate)
- **Global climate**: The overall atmospheric conditions of the entire Earth

### Why the Distinction Matters

The distinction between weather and climate is crucial for understanding climate change. A single cold winter or hot summer represents weather variability, not climate change. Climate change refers to statistically significant shifts in average conditions and the frequency of extreme events over decades or longer. Pupils frequently conflate short-term weather events with long-term climate trends—a misconception that requires explicit addressing.

The Royal Meteorological Society identifies this as one of the most common climate misconceptions among school leavers. Teachers should use the "loading the dice" analogy: climate change loads the dice so that certain weather outcomes become more likely (more frequent heatwaves, more intense rainfall events) without determining any specific outcome.

## The Global Circulation of the Atmosphere

### Energy Imbalance and the Driver of Circulation

The primary driver of global atmospheric circulation is the uneven distribution of solar energy across the Earth's surface. The equator receives approximately 2.5 times more solar radiation per unit area than the poles due to:

- **The curvature of the Earth**: At higher latitudes, the same amount of solar energy spreads over a larger surface area
- **Atmospheric path length**: Solar rays pass through more atmosphere at high latitudes, causing greater scattering and absorption
- **Albedo differences**: Polar ice and snow reflect more solar radiation back to space compared to dark ocean surfaces at the equator

This energy imbalance creates temperature gradients that drive atmospheric circulation. The atmosphere and oceans act as a giant heat engine, transferring excess heat from the equator toward the poles through complex circulation patterns.

### The Tricellular Model

The tricellular model describes the large-scale atmospheric circulation as three distinct cells in each hemisphere: the Hadley cell, the Ferrel cell and the Polar cell. This model, developed from the work of George Hadley (1735) and William Ferrel (1856), provides the conceptual framework for understanding global wind patterns and pressure belts.

#### The Hadley Cell (0°–30°)

The Hadley cell is the largest and most thermally direct of the three cells, dominating the tropical atmosphere:

1. **Heating at the equator**: Intense solar heating warms the surface air, causing it to rise through convection. This rising air creates a zone of low surface pressure known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) or equatorial trough.

2. **High-level flow**: As air rises, it expands and cools. At the top of the troposphere (approximately 12–16 km), the air flows poleward, deflected eastward by the Coriolis effect.

3. **Descent in the subtropics**: Around 30° north and south, the cooled air sinks back toward the surface, creating zones of high pressure known as the subtropical anticyclones or horse latitudes.

4. **Surface return flow**: The descending air flows back toward the equator near the surface, forming the trade winds. In the Northern Hemisphere, these winds blow from the northeast (northeast trades); in the Southern Hemisphere, from the southeast (southeast trades).

The rising air at the equator carries enormous amounts of latent heat released through condensation, driving the world's most intense rainfall in tropical rainforest regions. The descending air in the subtropics creates arid conditions responsible for the world's major hot deserts (Sahara, Arabian, Kalahari, Australian deserts).

#### The Polar Cell (60°–90°)

The Polar cell is the smallest and thermally direct cell, operating in the polar regions:

1. **Cooling at the poles**: Intense radiative cooling chills the surface air, making it denser and causing it to sink. This creates zones of high surface pressure at the poles.

2. **Surface outflow**: The cold, dense air flows outward from the poles toward lower latitudes near the surface, deflected westward by the Coriolis effect to form the polar easterlies.

3. **Convergence and rising at 60°**: Around 60° north and south, the cold polar air meets warmer air from lower latitudes at the polar front. The warmer air is forced to rise over the colder, denser air, creating low-pressure zones.

4. **High-level return**: The rising air flows back toward the poles at high altitude, completing the circulation.

#### The Ferrel Cell (30°–60°)

The Ferrel cell, named after American meteorologist William Ferrel, is thermally indirect—unlike the Hadley and Polar cells, warm air sinks and cool air rises:

1. **Surface poleward flow**: Air at the surface flows from the subtropical high-pressure zones toward the polar front low-pressure zones, deflected by the Coriolis effect to create the prevailing westerly winds.

2. **Rising at the polar front**: The convergence of warm subtropical air and cold polar air at approximately 60° latitude forces air upward along the polar front.

3. **High-level equatorward flow**: The rising air flows back toward the subtropics at high altitude.

4. **Descent in the subtropics**: The air sinks to complete the circulation, though this descent is less pronounced than in the Hadley cell.

The Ferrel cell is driven mechanically by the adjacent Hadley and Polar cells rather than by thermal forcing. Its existence was controversial until the mid-20th century when upper-air observations confirmed the circulation pattern.

### Pressure Belts and Wind Systems

The tricellular model produces characteristic global pressure belts and associated surface wind systems:

| Latitude | Pressure Belt | Characteristics | Surface Winds |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 0° (equator) | Equatorial Low (ITCZ) | Rising air, low pressure, heavy rainfall, thunderstorms | Light, variable (Doldrums) |
| 30° N/S | Subtropical High | Descending air, high pressure, clear skies, arid conditions | Trade winds (toward equator), Westerlies (toward poles) |
| 60° N/S | Subpolar Low | Converging air masses, rising air, low pressure, stormy | Westerlies (poleward), Polar easterlies (equatorward) |
| 90° N/S | Polar High | Descending cold air, high pressure, clear skies, very cold | Polar easterlies |

### The Coriolis Effect

The Coriolis effect—a consequence of Earth's rotation—fundamentally shapes global wind patterns. As the Earth rotates eastward, different latitudes move at different speeds: the equator rotates at approximately 1,670 km/h, while the poles rotate at zero. When air moves north or south, it conserves its initial eastward momentum, causing apparent deflection:

- In the **Northern Hemisphere**, moving air is deflected to the **right**
- In the **Southern Hemisphere**, moving air is deflected to the **left**

The magnitude of deflection increases with latitude and with wind speed. The Coriolis effect is responsible for:
- The curvature of trade winds and westerlies
- The rotation of large-scale weather systems (depressions and anticyclones)
- The formation of jet streams

### Jet Streams

Jet streams are narrow bands of strong wind (typically 100–300 km/h) in the upper troposphere, occurring at the boundaries between atmospheric cells:

- **The Polar Front Jet (PFJ)**: Forms at the boundary between Ferrel and Polar cells (approximately 50–60° latitude), associated with the polar front
- **The Subtropical Jet (STJ)**: Forms at the boundary between Hadley and Ferrel cells (approximately 30° latitude)

Jet streams significantly influence UK weather, particularly the Polar Front Jet. When the PFJ is strong and direct, it steers Atlantic depressions toward the UK, bringing wet, windy weather. When the PFJ weakens or meanders (develops "Rossby waves"), it can allow cold polar air to spill southward or warm tropical air to move northward—creating blocking patterns that cause prolonged periods of settled weather.

## UK Weather Patterns

### The UK's Maritime Climate

The United Kingdom experiences a temperate maritime climate (Köppen classification: Cfb), characterised by:

- **Mild winters**: The North Atlantic Drift (an extension of the Gulf Stream) brings warm water to UK shores, keeping winter temperatures significantly warmer than other locations at similar latitudes
- **Cool summers**: Maritime influence prevents extreme summer heat
- **Year-round precipitation**: No distinct dry season, with rainfall distributed throughout the year
- **Changeable weather**: Rapid shifts between different air masses and weather systems
- **High humidity**: Proximity to the Atlantic Ocean keeps atmospheric moisture levels elevated

The UK's climate results from its position at the intersection of several major climate influences:

1. **Latitude** (50°–60° N): Places the UK within the mid-latitude westerlies, dominated by weather systems moving from west to east
2. **Maritime position**: Surrounded by water, moderating temperature extremes
3. **Ocean currents**: The North Atlantic Drift brings warm water from the Gulf of Mexico
4. **Atmospheric circulation**: Positioned under the Polar Front Jet and between subtropical and polar air masses

### Air Masses Affecting the UK

The UK's weather is determined primarily by the movement of air masses—large bodies of air with relatively uniform temperature and moisture characteristics. According to the Royal Meteorological Society, six main air masses influence the UK:

#### Tropical Maritime (Tm)
- **Source**: South-west Atlantic/Azores
- **Characteristics**: Warm, moist
- **UK weather**: Mild, cloudy, wet conditions; steady rainfall; warm summers
- **Seasonal variation**: Most common air mass; brings mild winters and warm, humid summers

#### Polar Maritime (Pm)
- **Source**: North Atlantic, north of the UK
- **Characteristics**: Cold, moist, unstable
- **UK weather**: Cold, showery conditions; heavy hail and thunder possible; bright intervals between showers
- **Seasonal variation**: Common in winter; can bring snow to high ground

#### Polar Continental (Pc)
- **Source**: Northern Europe/Russia
- **Characteristics**: Cold, dry, stable
- **UK weather**: Cold, frosty conditions; clear skies; occasional snow; temperatures may remain below freezing all day
- **Seasonal variation**: Most common in winter; brings severe cold snaps

#### Tropical Continental (Tc)
- **Source**: Southern Europe/North Africa
- **Characteristics**: Hot, dry, stable
- **UK weather**: Hot, sunny conditions; heatwaves; occasionally thundery breakdown
- **Seasonal variation**: Most common in summer; brings the UK's highest temperatures

#### Arctic Maritime (Am)
- **Source**: Arctic Ocean/Greenland
- **Characteristics**: Very cold, moist, unstable
- **UK weather**: Very cold with snow showers, especially on northern and eastern coasts
- **Seasonal variation**: Occasional in winter; brings severe winter weather

#### Returning Polar Maritime (rPm)
- **Source**: Arctic, but travels south over warm Atlantic before reaching UK
- **Characteristics**: Cool, moist, very unstable
- **UK weather**: Unsettled with heavy showers and thunderstorms
- **Seasonal variation**: Most common in spring and autumn

### Depressions and Anticyclones

The UK lies within the mid-latitude westerlies where air masses frequently meet, creating dynamic weather systems.

#### Depressions (Low-Pressure Systems)

Depressions (also called cyclones or lows) are areas of low atmospheric pressure where air converges and rises, creating cloud and precipitation. They form along the polar front where warm tropical air meets cold polar air.

**Structure of a depression**:
- **Warm front**: The leading edge where warm air advances, rising gradually over cold air. Produces layered cloud (cirrus, altostratus, nimbostratus) and prolonged, steady precipitation.
- **Warm sector**: The region of warm air between fronts, typically bringing mild, cloudy, drizzly conditions.
- **Cold front**: The trailing edge where cold air advances, forcing warm air up rapidly. Produces cumulonimbus clouds, heavy showers, and thunderstorms.
- **Cold sector**: The region behind the cold front with cooler, clearer, more stable conditions.

Depressions typically move from west to east across the UK, bringing a characteristic sequence of weather: cirrus clouds, steady rain from altostratus, clearing to the warm sector with drizzle, then heavy showers and thunderstorms at the cold front, followed by clearer, cooler conditions.

#### Anticyclones (High-Pressure Systems)

Anticyclones are areas of high atmospheric pressure where air descends and diverges, suppressing cloud formation and precipitation. In the UK:

- **Winter anticyclones**: Bring cold, frosty conditions with fog and temperature inversions. When persistent, they can cause severe cold spells.
- **Summer anticyclones**: Bring warm, sunny conditions with light winds. The descending air suppresses convection, often trapping pollution near the surface and creating photochemical smog in urban areas.

Anticyclones can become "blocking highs" when they persist for several days or weeks, preventing the normal progression of Atlantic depressions. This can cause prolonged heatwaves in summer or cold spells in winter.

### Seasonal Variations in UK Weather

#### Winter (December–February)
- Short daylight hours
- Depressions track south of the UK, bringing wet, windy weather
- Polar continental air can bring severe cold and snow
- Temperature inversions common in anticyclonic conditions
- West and south-west receive most rainfall; east is drier but colder

#### Spring (March–May)
- Rapidly increasing daylight
- Most changeable season with alternating air masses
- Returning Polar Maritime air brings showers and thunderstorms
- Spring warmth develops earliest in the south and east

#### Summer (June–August)
- Longest daylight hours
- Azores High occasionally extends toward the UK, bringing heatwaves
- Convective showers develop on warm days
- Thunderstorms often follow hot spells
- Regional temperature differences most pronounced

#### Autumn (September–November)
- Rapidly decreasing daylight
- Atlantic depressions become more vigorous
- Warmest sea surface temperatures of the year maintain mild conditions
- First frosts occur in sheltered northern areas
- Hurricane remnants occasionally reach the UK

## Climate Change

### Evidence of Climate Change

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. While natural climate variability has occurred throughout Earth's history, the current warming trend is unprecedented in rate and magnitude and is unequivocally caused by human activities.

#### Temperature Records

The instrumental temperature record shows:
- Global average temperature has increased by approximately **1.1°C since pre-industrial times** (IPCC, 2021)
- The last decade (2014–2023) was the warmest on record
- 2023 was the hottest year globally, with 2024 likely to exceed it
- The rate of warming has accelerated: approximately **0.18°C per decade** since 1981

In the UK specifically:
- All of the UK's ten warmest years have occurred since 2002
- 2022 was the UK's hottest year on record, with temperatures exceeding 40°C for the first time
- Central England Temperature (CET) records dating to 1659 show a warming trend of approximately 0.8°C per century

#### Ice and Snow Evidence

Multiple independent lines of evidence document the retreat of ice across the planet:

- **Arctic sea ice**: Has declined by approximately 13% per decade since satellite measurements began in 1979. The area of Arctic sea ice in September (the annual minimum) is now about 40% smaller than in 1980.
- **Glaciers**: Worldwide glacier mass balance shows consistent losses. The World Glacier Monitoring Service reports that glaciers have lost approximately 300 billion tonnes of ice annually since 2000.
- **Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets**: Both are losing mass through a combination of surface melting and dynamic discharge of ice into the ocean. Greenland is currently losing ice seven times faster than in the 1990s.
- **Snow cover**: Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover has decreased by about 10% since the 1960s.

#### Sea Level Rise

Global mean sea level has risen by approximately 21–24 cm since 1880, with the rate accelerating:
- 1.3 mm/year (1901–1990)
- 3.7 mm/year (2006–2018)

Thermal expansion of warming seawater accounts for about 50% of sea level rise, with melting ice contributing the remainder. Even if greenhouse gas emissions stopped today, sea level would continue rising for centuries due to the thermal inertia of the oceans.

#### Extreme Weather Events

Climate change is altering the frequency and intensity of extreme weather:
- **Heatwaves**: Becoming more frequent, longer and more intense globally. The 2022 UK heatwave (40°C) was made at least 10 times more likely by climate change.
- **Heavy precipitation**: A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture (approximately 7% more per 1°C warming), intensifying rainfall events. The UK has experienced a 17% increase in heavy rain events since the 1960s.
- **Droughts**: While overall rainfall may not decrease, changes in timing and increased evaporation are exacerbating drought conditions in many regions.
- **Tropical storms**: While not necessarily more frequent, they appear to be becoming more intense, with greater rainfall and stronger winds.

### Causes of Climate Change

#### The Greenhouse Effect

The greenhouse effect is a natural process that keeps Earth's surface approximately 33°C warmer than it would otherwise be, making the planet habitable. Greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere allow shortwave solar radiation to pass through but absorb and re-emit longwave infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface.

Key greenhouse gases include:
- **Water vapour (H₂O)**: The most abundant greenhouse gas, responsible for about 50% of the natural greenhouse effect
- **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)**: Accounts for approximately 20% of the natural effect but is the primary driver of anthropogenic warming
- **Methane (CH₄)**: About 28–36 times more effective at trapping heat than CO₂ over 100 years
- **Nitrous oxide (N₂O)**: Approximately 265–298 times more potent than CO₂
- **Ozone (O₃)**: Significant both in the troposphere and stratosphere

#### Anthropogenic Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Human activities have significantly increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases:

**Carbon Dioxide**:
- Pre-industrial level: approximately 280 parts per million (ppm)
- Current level (2024): approximately 425 ppm
- Rate of increase: over 2 ppm per year—unprecedented in at least 800,000 years
- Primary sources: fossil fuel combustion (coal, oil, natural gas), deforestation, cement production

**Methane**:
- Pre-industrial: approximately 700 parts per billion (ppb)
- Current level: approximately 1,900 ppb
- Primary sources: livestock agriculture, rice cultivation, fossil fuel extraction, waste decomposition in landfills

**Nitrous Oxide**:
- Pre-industrial: approximately 270 ppb
- Current level: approximately 335 ppb
- Primary sources: synthetic fertilisers, livestock manure, industrial processes

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded in its Sixth Assessment Report (2021) that it is "unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land."

#### Other Anthropogenic Factors

- **Aerosols**: Industrial aerosols reflect sunlight, causing a cooling effect that partially offsets greenhouse gas warming. Reducing air pollution (desirable for health) actually increases warming in the short term.
- **Land use change**: Deforestation and urbanisation alter surface albedo and evapotranspiration, affecting local and regional climates.
- **Agriculture**: Changes in land cover and management affect carbon storage and surface energy balance.

### Impacts of Climate Change

Climate change impacts are already being observed across natural and human systems:

#### Environmental Impacts
- **Ecosystem disruption**: Species are shifting ranges poleward and upward in elevation. Timing of seasonal events (phenology) is changing, disrupting established ecological relationships.
- **Coral bleaching**: Rising sea temperatures cause mass coral bleaching events. The Great Barrier Reef has experienced four mass bleaching events since 2016.
- **Ocean acidification**: Oceans have absorbed approximately 25% of anthropogenic CO₂ emissions, reducing pH by 0.1 units (30% increase in acidity) and threatening marine calcifying organisms.
- **Biodiversity loss**: Climate change compounds other pressures (habitat loss, pollution) to drive species toward extinction. An estimated 1 million species are at risk.

#### Human Impacts
- **Food security**: Changing precipitation patterns, increasing temperatures, and extreme weather affect crop yields. Tropical regions face the greatest risks.
- **Water security**: Glacial retreat threatens water supplies for billions of people. Changing monsoon patterns affect agriculture across Asia.
- **Health impacts**: Heat-related mortality is increasing. Climate change expands the range of vector-borne diseases (malaria, dengue). Air quality deteriorates in heatwaves.
- **Displacement**: The World Bank estimates that by 2050, climate change could force 216 million people to migrate within their own countries.
- **Economic costs**: Extreme weather events already cost the global economy hundreds of billions annually. The UK experienced £3–4 billion in insured losses from the 2022 heatwave alone.

### Responses to Climate Change

Responses to climate change fall into two categories: mitigation (reducing emissions) and adaptation (adjusting to unavoidable impacts).

#### Mitigation

**Energy Transition**:
- Transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal)
- Electrification of transport and heating
- Energy efficiency improvements across all sectors
- Nuclear power expansion in some countries

**The Paris Agreement** (2015):
- Legally binding international treaty
- Goal: limit warming to well below 2°C, preferably 1.5°C, above pre-industrial levels
- Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) outlining country-level commitments
- Current pledges are insufficient to meet the 1.5°C target

**UK Climate Commitments**:
- Net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (legally binding under the Climate Change Act 2008, amended 2019)
- 78% reduction by 2035 (compared to 1990 levels)
- Coal phase-out by 2024
- New petrol and diesel vehicle sales banned from 2030

#### Adaptation

Adaptation measures include:
- **Flood defences**: Improved flood barriers, sustainable drainage systems, restoring natural floodplains
- **Heat adaptation**: Cool roofs, urban greening, heat-health action plans
- **Agricultural adaptation**: Developing heat and drought-resistant crop varieties, changing planting dates
- **Water management**: Reservoir construction, water efficiency measures, demand management
- **Ecosystem restoration**: Protecting and restoring natural systems (wetlands, forests, mangroves) that provide climate resilience

The UK National Adaptation Programme sets out the government's approach to preparing for climate change impacts.

## Teaching Weather, Climate and Climate Change

### Key Pedagogical Approaches

#### Establishing Foundational Concepts

Before tackling climate change, ensure pupils have secure understanding of:
- The distinction between weather and climate
- Basic atmospheric processes (heating, convection, condensation)
- How to interpret weather maps and synoptic charts
- The difference between natural variability and long-term trends

The Royal Meteorological Society recommends spending considerable time on these foundations before introducing climate change, as misconceptions at this stage impede later learning.

#### Using Models Appropriately

The tricellular model is an idealisation—simplified but pedagogically powerful:
- Emphasise that it is a model, not a complete description
- Use animations and visualisations to show three-dimensional circulation
- Connect the model to observable phenomena (trade winds, desert locations, UK weather patterns)
- Challenge pupils to identify evidence that supports or complicates the model

#### Engaging with Data

Pupils should work with real climate data:
- Analyse local weather station records
- Use online resources (Met Office, NASA GISS, NOAA) to explore global datasets
- Calculate trends and variability
- Distinguish between weather noise and climate signal

#### Addressing Climate Change Controversy

Climate change education must navigate complex social and political dimensions:
- Teach the scientific consensus while acknowledging the process of scientific enquiry
- Explore why controversy exists despite overwhelming scientific agreement
- Avoid overly catastrophic framing that induces anxiety and helplessness
- Empower pupils through focus on solutions and agency

The Geographical Association's "Climate Clarity" resources address common misconceptions directly.

### Common Pupil Misconceptions

| Misconception | Scientific Correction |
|--------------|---------------------|
| "A cold winter disproves global warming" | Weather is not climate; warming increases variability; Arctic warming can disrupt jet stream, causing cold outbreaks |
| "Climate has always changed naturally" | True, but current warming is much faster and is unequivocally human-caused |
| "The ozone hole causes climate change" | Different issue; ozone depletion is recovering due to Montreal Protocol |
| "All extreme weather is caused by climate change" | Climate change alters probabilities, not certainty; use "loaded dice" analogy |
| "There's nothing we can do" | Individual, community and political actions can all contribute; system change is essential |

### Practical Activities

- **Cloud observation**: Use the Beaufort scale and cloud identification keys
- **Microclimate investigation**: Compare temperatures in different school environments
- **Synoptic chart analysis**: Track depressions across the UK
- **Climate data analysis**: Calculate trends from long-term records
- **Climate negotiation simulation**: Model COP processes to understand geopolitical challenges
- **Carbon footprint calculation**: Connect personal choices to emissions

### Assessment Approaches

Effective assessment should evaluate:
- Understanding of atmospheric processes (not just recall of terms)
- Ability to explain UK weather patterns using air mass theory
- Critical evaluation of climate change evidence
- Balanced consideration of mitigation and adaptation strategies
- Application of knowledge to unfamiliar contexts and locations
