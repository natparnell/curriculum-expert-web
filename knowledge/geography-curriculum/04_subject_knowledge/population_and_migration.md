# Population and Migration in Geography Education

## Overview and Curriculum Significance

Population and migration represents one of the foundational themes in geography education, bridging human and physical geography while connecting directly to students' lived experiences and contemporary global issues. The Geographical Association (GA) identifies population dynamics as essential for developing students' understanding of how human societies organise themselves across space and how demographic processes shape economic, social, and environmental outcomes at multiple scales.

This domain encompasses three interconnected areas: population change (birth rates, death rates, and natural increase), population structure (age and gender composition shown through population pyramids), and migration (the movement of people across boundaries). Together, these elements help students understand why the world's population reached 8 billion in 2022, why some countries face ageing populations while others have youthful demographics, and why migration remains one of the most contested and misunderstood geographical phenomena of our time.

The study of population and migration develops crucial geographical skills including data analysis (interpreting population pyramids and demographic statistics), map skills (mapping migration flows), and critical thinking (evaluating the DTM's applicability to different contexts). The Office for National Statistics (ONS) provides rich data sources that enable students to work with real UK demographic information, making abstract concepts tangible and relevant.

## Population Change: The Components of Growth

### Understanding Natural Change

Population change in any given area results from two primary components: natural change (the difference between births and deaths) and net migration (the difference between people entering and leaving). Understanding these components is essential for accurate demographic analysis and for challenging common misconceptions about population growth.

**Birth rates** (typically expressed as births per 1,000 population per year) vary dramatically between countries and regions. High birth rates are generally associated with countries in the early stages of the Demographic Transition Model, where children are economically valuable (contributing to labour and providing old-age security) and where contraceptive access may be limited. The Geographical Association emphasises that teaching birth rates requires sensitivity to cultural differences and avoidance of deficit narratives about developing countries.

**Death rates** (deaths per 1,000 population per year) have declined globally over the past century due to improvements in healthcare, sanitation, nutrition, and disease control. The dramatic reduction in infant mortality—from approximately 140 deaths per 1,000 live births globally in 1950 to 28 per 1,000 in 2021—represents one of humanity's greatest achievements. Teaching this topic provides opportunities to explore healthcare geography, the work of organisations like WHO and UNICEF, and the uneven distribution of medical advances.

**Natural increase** occurs when birth rates exceed death rates; natural decrease occurs when death rates exceed birth rates. As of 2025, the UK experiences a natural decrease (approximately 651,000 deaths versus 653,000 births in the year ending June 2025), meaning population growth depends entirely on net migration. This reality challenges students' assumptions about population dynamics in developed countries.

### The Demographic Transition Model (DTM)

The Demographic Transition Model is perhaps the most important conceptual framework in population geography, describing how population growth rates change as countries develop economically. Based originally on the historical experience of the United Kingdom and other Western European countries, the model presents five stages that trace the relationship between birth rates, death rates, and total population.

**Stage 1: High Stationary**
In this pre-industrial stage, both birth rates and death rates are high (approximately 35-40 per 1,000), resulting in low or fluctuating population growth. Population is kept in check by disease, famine, and limited medical knowledge. No countries remain in Stage 1 today, though isolated indigenous communities may approximate these conditions. Teaching Stage 1 requires careful handling to avoid presenting historical populations as primitive, instead emphasising how people developed sophisticated strategies for survival within challenging environments.

**Stage 2: Early Expanding**
Death rates begin to fall (to approximately 15-20 per 1,000) while birth rates remain high, causing rapid population growth. This transition occurred in Europe during the Industrial Revolution with improvements in sanitation, medicine, and food supply. Many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa experienced Stage 2 during the late 20th century. Kenya exemplifies this stage: death rates fell from 20 per 1,000 in 1960 to 7 per 1,000 by 2000, while birth rates remained above 30 per 1,000, producing annual population growth exceeding 3%.

**Stage 3: Late Expanding**
Birth rates begin to fall (to approximately 15-25 per 1,000), narrowing the gap with death rates and slowing population growth. This transition correlates with urbanisation, improved female education, increased access to contraception, and changing economic incentives regarding children. India represents a contemporary Stage 3 country: birth rates have fallen from 36 per 1,000 in 1970 to 17 per 1,000 today, though with vast regional variation between states like Kerala (TFR 1.6) and Bihar (TFR 3.0).

**Stage 4: Low Stationary**
Both birth rates and death rates are low (approximately 10-15 per 1,000), producing stable or slowly growing populations. Most developed countries occupy this stage. The UK, with a birth rate of approximately 11 per 1,000 and death rate of 9 per 1,000, exemplifies Stage 4 characteristics, though contemporary migration patterns complicate simple categorisation.

**Stage 5: Declining?**
Some demographers propose a fifth stage where birth rates fall below death rates, producing natural population decline. Japan, Italy, and several Eastern European countries currently experience this pattern, with fertility rates well below replacement level (2.1 children per woman). The UK appears to be approaching Stage 5, with 2024-25 data showing natural decrease for the first time in decades.

### Critical Evaluation of the DTM

Teaching the DTM effectively requires acknowledging its limitations. The model was developed from the European experience and may not predict pathways for all countries. Counter-examples include:

- **Bangladesh**: Achieved Stage 3 characteristics (declining fertility) at much lower income levels than European countries, challenging the assumption that economic development must precede demographic transition
- **Sub-Saharan Africa**: Some countries have stalled in Stage 2 due to HIV/AIDS impacts on mortality and fertility patterns
- **China's One-Child Policy**: Created an artificially accelerated transition with unique demographic consequences including severe gender imbalance and rapid ageing
- **Cultural variation**: Religious and cultural factors influence fertility decisions independently of economic development, as seen in consistently higher fertility among ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in Israel regardless of income

The GA recommends teaching the DTM as a useful generalisation rather than a deterministic law, encouraging students to identify factors that accelerate, delay, or alter the transition in different contexts.

## Population Structure and Pyramids

### Reading Population Pyramids

Population pyramids provide visual representation of a country's age and gender structure, revealing demographic history and enabling predictions about future trends. Teaching students to interpret pyramids develops data analysis skills central to geographical inquiry.

A population pyramid displays:
- **Age groups** on the vertical axis (typically in 5-year cohorts)
- **Population numbers or percentages** on the horizontal axis
- **Gender separation** with males usually on the left and females on the right

**Expansive pyramids** (wide base, narrow top) indicate high birth rates and youthful populations typical of Stage 2 countries. Nigeria's pyramid demonstrates this pattern clearly, with approximately 43% of the population under age 15.

**Stationary pyramids** (roughly rectangular) indicate stable birth and death rates characteristic of Stage 4. The UK's pyramid shows this pattern, though with distinctive bulges corresponding to post-war baby booms.

**Constrictive pyramids** (narrower base than middle sections) indicate below-replacement fertility and ageing populations. Japan's inverted pyramid shape shows the demographic challenges facing many East Asian and European nations.

### Dependency Ratios and Their Implications

Population pyramids enable calculation of dependency ratios—the proportion of dependents (those aged 0-14 and 65+) to the working-age population (15-64). High dependency ratios create economic pressures:

**Youth dependency** (high proportion of children) requires investment in education, healthcare, and childcare infrastructure. Countries with very youthful populations must achieve rapid economic growth simply to maintain current living standards as cohorts enter the workforce.

**Elderly dependency** (high proportion of older people) strains pension systems and healthcare provision. The UK's old-age dependency ratio has risen from approximately 25 retirees per 100 working-age adults in 1980 to over 30 per 100 today, with projections suggesting 40+ per 100 by 2050.

Teaching dependency ratios connects to contemporary debates about pension ages, immigration policy (working-age migrants reduce dependency ratios), and intergenerational equity. The GA suggests using real UK ONS data to make these calculations tangible for students.

### The UK's Changing Demographic Profile

The United Kingdom's population structure has undergone dramatic changes that provide excellent case study material:

**Post-war baby boom**: The 1946-1964 baby boom created a distinctive bulge visible in population pyramids, with significant implications for housing demand, education provision, and now elderly care requirements.

**Echo effects**: The children of baby boomers produced secondary demographic bulges, creating uneven demand across the life course. This helps explain cyclical pressures on primary schools, universities, and housing markets.

**Increasing longevity**: Life expectancy at birth increased from 68 years (men) and 74 years (women) in 1950 to 79 and 83 years respectively today. While this represents progress, recent data shows stalling improvements and concerning health inequality gaps between affluent and deprived areas.

**Fertility decline**: The UK's Total Fertility Rate has remained below replacement level (2.1) since 1973, currently standing at approximately 1.6. This long-term trend has profound implications for future population composition.

**Ethnic diversity**: The 2021 Census revealed that 18.3% of the UK population identified with an ethnic minority group, up from 14.6% in 2011. Age profiles differ significantly by ethnicity, with minority populations generally younger than the White British average.

## Migration: Patterns, Processes, and Policies

### Classifying Migration

Migration—the movement of people across boundaries for periods exceeding one year—represents one of the most politically charged geographical topics. Effective teaching requires precise classification and nuance:

**By distance**:
- **International migration**: Movement across national borders (e.g., Poland to UK, Syria to Germany)
- **Internal migration**: Movement within national boundaries (e.g., London to Cornwall, rural to urban areas in China)

**By cause**:
- **Voluntary migration**: Economic migration (seeking work), educational migration, retirement migration
- **Forced migration**: Refugees (fleeing persecution), asylum seekers (seeking protection), internally displaced persons (IDPs)

**By duration**:
- **Permanent migration**: Intent to settle indefinitely
- **Temporary migration**: Fixed-term employment, study, or working holiday schemes
- **Circular migration**: Repeated movement between origin and destination (e.g., seasonal agricultural workers)

**By direction**:
- **Immigration**: Entry to a country
- **Emigration**: Exit from a country
- **Net migration**: The difference between immigration and emigration

The GA emphasises that teaching migration requires challenging media stereotypes and providing accurate data. For example, while refugees receive significant media coverage, they represent only approximately 10% of international migrants globally; most migration is economic and occurs through legal channels.

### Theories of Migration

Several theoretical frameworks help explain why people migrate:

**Ravenstein's Laws of Migration** (1885): Based on UK census data, these generalisations remain relevant:
- Most migrants travel short distances
- Long-distance migrants typically move to major cities
- Every migration flow produces a counter-flow
- Urban residents are less migratory than rural dwellers
- Young adults are most likely to migrate

**Push-Pull Theory**: Migration results from negative conditions in origin areas (push factors: unemployment, conflict, environmental degradation) and positive conditions in destination areas (pull factors: employment opportunities, safety, services). Critics note this framework oversimplifies complex decision-making and ignores barriers that prevent migration despite strong push factors.

**Lee's Migration Model**: Expands push-pull by incorporating intervening obstacles (border controls, costs, distance) and personal factors (age, education, family situation) that filter who can actually migrate.

**New Economics of Labour Migration**: Views migration decisions as household strategies for income diversification and risk management rather than purely individual utility maximisation. This explains remittance flows and circular migration patterns.

### UK Migration Patterns and Policies

The UK's migration experience provides rich case study material spanning decades:

**Post-war immigration** (1948-1962): The British Nationality Act 1948 created citizenship rights for Commonwealth residents, leading to migration from the Caribbean (the "Windrush generation"), South Asia, and Africa. The 1962 Commonwealth Immigrants Act marked the beginning of immigration restriction.

**EU enlargement** (2004-2020): Accession of Eastern European countries generated significant migration flows, particularly from Poland, which became the UK's largest foreign-born population. Freedom of movement meant this migration required no visas or work permits.

**Post-Brexit system** (2021-present): The points-based immigration system prioritises skilled workers, ending free movement for EU citizens and treating EU and non-EU migrants identically. This represents the most significant immigration policy change in decades.

**Current statistics** (ONS, year ending June 2025): Estimated long-term net migration was 204,000—substantially lower than the peak of 764,000 in 2022. Work visas remain the largest category, followed by study and family reunion.

Teaching UK migration requires sensitivity to the lived experiences of migrant students and their families, while also acknowledging legitimate debates about housing, services, and labour market impacts. The British Red Cross provides excellent resources for developing empathy and challenging stereotypes.

### Global Migration Case Studies

**Syrian refugee crisis** (2011-present): The Syrian civil war generated approximately 6.8 million refugees and 6.9 million internally displaced persons—the largest displacement crisis of the 21st century. Neighbouring countries (Turkey hosts 3.6 million, Lebanon 1.5 million, Jordan 675,000) bear disproportionate responsibility, while European resettlement has been limited and politically contentious. Teaching this case study connects to understanding conflict geography, humanitarian responses, and the challenges of protracted displacement.

**Ukrainian displacement** (2022-present): Russia's invasion generated over 6 million refugees and 5 million IDPs within months—Europe's fastest displacement since World War II. The EU's temporary protection directive provided immediate rights to work, access services, and move freely within the EU, contrasting with treatment of Syrian refugees. This case study illustrates how political context shapes humanitarian responses and highlights the temporary nature of many displacement situations.

**Internal migration in China**: The world's largest migration flow involves rural-to-urban movement within China, with approximately 290 million rural migrants living in cities. The hukou (household registration) system creates a distinctive form of stratified citizenship, limiting migrants' access to urban services and education. This case study demonstrates that not all migration is international and connects to understanding contemporary China's economic transformation.

## Teaching Approaches and Pedagogical Strategies

### Enquiry-Based Learning

The GA recommends enquiry-based approaches for teaching population and migration, enabling students to work with real data and develop independent investigative skills:

**Population pyramid enquiries**: Provide students with pyramid data for different countries and ask them to identify patterns, explain causes, and predict consequences. The ONS website provides downloadable UK data; Gapminder and World Population Prospects offer global datasets.

**Migration mapping exercises**: Students map global migration flows using arrow thickness to represent scale, then investigate the factors driving major flows. This develops map skills while building understanding of global inequalities.

**Demographic forecasting**: Using current trends, students predict future UK population composition and debate policy implications. This develops quantitative skills while connecting to citizenship education.

### Addressing Controversial Topics

Population and migration topics often generate strong opinions based on media narratives rather than evidence. The GA advises:

**Use data to challenge misconceptions**: Many students overestimate UK immigration levels, refugee numbers, and population growth rates. Accurate ONS and UNHCR data provides necessary corrective.

**Include migrant voices**: Where possible, incorporate testimonies from migrants (with appropriate safeguarding). Organisations like Reboot the Future provide classroom resources based on refugee experiences.

**Avoid deficit narratives**: When teaching about high-fertility countries, emphasise agency and contextual factors rather than presenting development as requiring Western-style demographic patterns.

**Separate descriptive from normative**: Teach students to distinguish factual statements ("The UK population is growing due to net migration") from value judgements ("Immigration is good/bad for the UK").

### Common Misconceptions and Corrections

**Misconception**: "The world's population is growing exponentially everywhere."
**Correction**: Population growth is concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia; Europe, East Asia, and North America experience slowing growth or decline.

**Misconception**: "Most migrants are refugees fleeing war."
**Correction**: Refugees represent approximately 10% of international migrants; most migration is economic and voluntary.

**Misconception**: "The UK is 'full' and cannot accommodate more people."
**Correction**: The UK has lower population density than Belgium, the Netherlands, and South Korea; distribution (southeast concentration) matters more than absolute numbers.

**Misconception**: "Immigrants take jobs and burden public services."
**Correction**: Economic migrants are typically of working age, pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits, and fill labour market gaps; impacts vary by skill level and sector.

**Misconception**: "The DTM predicts all countries will follow the same pathway."
**Correction**: The DTM describes historical patterns in Western Europe; countries may experience different transitions due to policy interventions (China), disease (HIV/AIDS impacts in Africa), or cultural factors (religious fertility norms).

### Progression Across Key Stages

**Key Stage 3**: Foundation concepts—interpreting population pyramids, understanding basic DTM stages, mapping migration flows, identifying push/pull factors. Focus on skills development and engagement with real data.

**Key Stage 4 (GCSE)**: Deeper theoretical understanding—evaluating DTM limitations, analysing demographic data critically, detailed case
studies of migration, connecting population to development geography. All major exam boards (AQA, OCR, Edexcel, Eduqas) include population and migration in their specifications, typically as optional topics within the Human Geography paper.

**Key Stage 5 (A Level)**: Advanced theoretical engagement—critiquing migration theories using academic literature, conducting independent investigations (NEA) on local demographic topics, evaluating government population policies, understanding global governance of migration. The GA's Top Spec Geography: Migration & Global Governance provides excellent extension material.

## Assessment and Examination Approaches

### GCSE Assessment Requirements

All major exam boards assess population and migration through similar approaches:

**AQA**: The "Changing Economic World" unit includes the DTM, population pyramids, and development indicators. Assessment emphasises applying knowledge to unfamiliar contexts and evaluating the usefulness of models.

**OCR**: The "Global Hazards" and "Changing Communities" units incorporate population dynamics, with particular focus on UK demographic trends and their social implications.

**Edexcel**: The "Globalisation" and "Diverse Places" units address migration patterns and multicultural communities, emphasising geographical skills and place-based understanding.

**Common question types**:
- Describe and explain patterns shown in population pyramids (4-6 marks)
- Evaluate the usefulness of the Demographic Transition Model (8-12 marks)
- Compare push and pull factors for different migration flows (4-6 marks)
- Assess the impacts of migration on source and destination areas (8-12 marks)
- Analyse the social, economic, and political implications of an ageing population (12+ marks)

### Developing Examination Skills

**Data response**: Students must practise interpreting population pyramids, demographic statistics tables, and migration flow maps under timed conditions. The ONS website provides authentic data sources for practice questions.

**Case study application**: Effective answers require specific, named examples rather than generic references. Students should know at least one detailed case study each for: a youthful population (e.g., Nigeria), an ageing population (e.g., Japan), international migration (e.g., Poland to UK), and refugee movement (e.g., Syria).

**Evaluation techniques**: Higher marks require critical assessment of models and theories. Students should practise using counter-examples (countries that don't fit the DTM), temporal changes (how migration patterns shift over time), and stakeholder perspectives (different groups experience migration impacts differently).

## Resources for Teaching Population and Migration

### Official Data Sources

**Office for National Statistics (ONS)**: The primary source for UK demographic data, including population estimates, migration statistics, and census information. The ONS website provides downloadable datasets, interactive visualisations, and teaching-friendly summaries.

**United Nations Population Division**: World Population Prospects provides global demographic data, population pyramids for all countries, and future projections. Essential for international comparisons.

**UNHCR (UN Refugee Agency)**: Statistical yearbooks and data portals provide authoritative information on refugee populations, asylum applications, and resettlement programmes. Critical for accurate teaching about forced migration.

**Gapminder**: Interactive tools for visualising global demographic trends over time, including the famous "200 countries, 200 years" animation showing income and life expectancy changes.

### Professional Association Resources

**Geographical Association**: The GA's "Teaching Human Geography" guidance includes a comprehensive reading list for population and migration, along with lesson ideas and case study materials. The Top Spec Geography: Migration & Global Governance textbook provides A Level extension content.

**Royal Geographical Society**: The RGS-IBG provides research summaries, case studies, and classroom resources connecting academic geography to school-level teaching.

**British Red Cross**: Refugee and migration teaching resources focus on developing empathy, challenging stereotypes, and understanding the humanitarian dimensions of displacement. Materials are carefully designed to be age-appropriate and sensitive.

### Academic Sources for Teacher Development

**Castles, de Haas, and Miller (2019)**: The Age of Migration (6th edition) is the definitive academic text on international migration, providing theoretical frameworks and global case studies for teacher subject knowledge development.

**Danny Dorling's research**: The Oxford geographer's work on UK population change, inequality, and demographic futures provides contemporary perspectives for extending beyond textbook content.

**Population Studies journals**: Academic articles from journals like *Population Studies* and *Demography* offer research insights, though teachers may need to translate technical findings into classroom-appropriate language.

## Contemporary Issues and Future Directions

### Climate Change and Migration

Environmental and climate-induced migration represents an emerging area of geographical significance. The IPCC projects that climate change will increasingly drive population movement through sea-level rise, drought, and extreme weather events. Teaching this topic requires nuance: most climate-affected populations move internally rather than internationally, and voluntary migration as adaptation should be distinguished from forced displacement due to sudden disasters.

The concept of "climate refugees" lacks legal standing under current international law, creating protection gaps for those displaced by environmental factors. This connects to broader citizenship questions about global responsibility and climate justice.

### Demographic Dividends and Deficits

The relationship between age structure and economic growth—the "demographic dividend"—provides valuable context for understanding development geography. Countries with declining fertility and large working-age populations (like India today) can experience rapid economic growth if education and employment opportunities expand accordingly. Conversely, countries with rapidly ageing populations face "demographic deficits" that challenge pension systems and healthcare provision.

Teaching these concepts helps students understand why population policy varies so dramatically between countries: some nations (e.g., Nigeria) focus on managing rapid growth, while others (e.g., Japan) implement policies to raise fertility and extend working lives.

### UK Policy Debates

Contemporary UK population debates provide excellent material for developing students' citizenship and critical thinking skills:

**Immigration policy post-Brexit**: The points-based system represents a fundamental shift from free movement. Students can evaluate the economic, social, and ethical implications of different immigration approaches.

**Ageing population responses**: Policies to raise state pension ages, encourage private pension saving, and support older workers in the labour market connect demographic trends to individual life choices.

**Housing and infrastructure**: Population growth and changing household structures (more single-person households, fewer families with children) create demand for different housing types and urban planning approaches.

**Regional demographic divergence**: While London and the South East experience population growth driven by international migration and internal movement, many northern towns and coastal areas face population decline and ageing. These divergent trajectories create distinct policy challenges.

## Conclusion

Population and migration geography offers unparalleled opportunities to connect classroom learning to students' lived experiences and contemporary global challenges. By working with real data from the ONS and international sources, evaluating models like the DTM against diverse country experiences, and engaging with the human stories behind migration statistics, students develop both geographical skills and informed citizenship.

Effective teaching in this domain requires up-to-date subject knowledge, sensitivity to the diverse experiences of students in our classrooms, and commitment to evidence-based discussion of contested topics. The frameworks, case studies, and pedagogical approaches outlined in this knowledge base provide foundations for teaching that is both academically rigorous and socially relevant.

The study of population and migration ultimately helps students understand one of geography's central questions: how do human societies organise themselves across space, and how do these spatial patterns change over time? In an era of rapid demographic transition, climate-induced displacement, and political contestation over migration, this understanding has never been more important.
