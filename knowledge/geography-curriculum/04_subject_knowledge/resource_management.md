# Resource Management and Sustainability

_The challenge of managing food, water and energy resources in the UK and globally_

---

## Overview and Key Concepts

Resource management lies at the heart of geographical study, encompassing the strategies, policies and practices employed to ensure sustainable access to the essential resources upon which human societies depend. The three most critical resources—food, water and energy—form the focus of the AQA GCSE Geography "Challenge of Resource Management" unit, reflecting their fundamental importance to human survival, economic development and geopolitical stability.

A **resource** may be defined as a stock or supply of something that has value or purpose for human use. Resources become significant when they satisfy human needs and wants, whether directly (such as drinking water) or indirectly (such as the energy required to transport goods). The classification of resources distinguishes between **renewable resources** (which can be replenished naturally within human timescales, such as solar energy and timber) and **non-renewable resources** (which exist in finite quantities and cannot be replaced once depleted, such as fossil fuels and certain minerals).

The geographical study of resource management extends beyond simple availability to examine **access**, **distribution** and **consumption patterns**. These dimensions reveal profound inequalities both within and between countries, raising fundamental questions about equity, environmental justice and the sustainability of current trajectories. The concept of **resource security**—ensuring reliable, affordable access to resources sufficient to meet needs—has emerged as a central concern for policymakers, geographers and citizens alike.

## The Geography of Food Security

### Defining Food Security

The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) defines **food security** as existing when "all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life." This definition encompasses four pillars: availability (sufficient quantities), access (economic and physical), utilisation (nutritional value and food safety) and stability (consistent access over time).

Food insecurity, conversely, manifests when any of these pillars fails. **Undernourishment**—consuming insufficient calories for an active life—affects approximately 735 million people globally as of 2023, representing a reversal of decades of progress following the COVID-19 pandemic, conflict and climate shocks. Beyond caloric deficiency, **micronutrient deficiency** ("hidden hunger") affects approximately two billion people worldwide, causing stunted development, impaired cognitive function and increased susceptibility to disease.

### Global Patterns of Food Supply and Consumption

The distribution of food production and consumption reveals stark geographical inequalities. **High-income countries**, representing approximately 16% of global population, consume roughly 37% of global food production by caloric value and an even greater share by economic value. Conversely, **Sub-Saharan Africa** and parts of **South Asia** experience the highest rates of undernourishment, despite these regions containing significant agricultural potential.

Several factors explain these disparities. **Physical geography** profoundly influences agricultural productivity: soil quality, water availability, temperature regimes and topography determine what can be grown where. The **Green Revolution** of the 1960s-70s dramatically increased yields in suitable environments through high-yield crop varieties, irrigation and synthetic fertilisers, but its benefits were unevenly distributed, largely bypassing marginal environments where the poorest farmers typically cultivate.

**Economic factors** create additional layers of inequality. Global food systems operate through complex commodity chains that often disadvantage primary producers. Farmers in lower-income countries frequently lack access to credit, technology and markets, while facing competition from subsidised agricultural exports from wealthy nations. The **World Trade Organisation** has attempted to address these imbalances, but agricultural protectionism remains politically entrenched in many developed countries.

### Factors Affecting Food Supply

The global food system faces mounting pressures from multiple directions. **Climate change** represents perhaps the most significant long-term threat, with rising temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns and increasing frequency of extreme weather events disrupting established agricultural systems. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that crop yields in tropical and subtropical regions may decline by 10-25% by 2050 under high-emissions scenarios, even as global food demand increases by approximately 50%.

**Water scarcity** increasingly constrains food production. Agriculture accounts for approximately 70% of global freshwater withdrawals, yet aquifer depletion, glacial retreat and changing river flows threaten irrigation capacity in critical breadbasket regions including the Indo-Gangetic Plain, the North China Plain and the Central Valley of California. The concept of **virtual water**—the water embedded in agricultural products—reveals how water-stressed regions effectively export their scarcity through food trade.

**Energy costs** directly influence food prices through fuel for machinery, fertiliser production (particularly nitrogen fertilisers derived from natural gas) and transportation. The 2022 energy crisis following Russia's invasion of Ukraine triggered food price spikes that exacerbated food insecurity globally, particularly in import-dependent nations in North Africa and the Middle East.

**Land degradation**, including soil erosion, salinisation and desertification, reduces productive capacity. The FAO estimates that approximately 25% of global agricultural land is degraded, with particularly severe impacts in sub-Saharan Africa and Central Asia. Meanwhile, **urbanisation** and competing land uses convert agricultural land to other purposes, with an estimated 30 million hectares of arable land lost to urban expansion between 1990 and 2015.

### Strategies for Increasing Food Supply

Addressing food security requires multifaceted approaches spanning technological innovation, policy reform and behavioural change. **Intensification strategies** aim to increase yields per hectare through improved seeds, irrigation, fertilisation and pest management. Genetically modified (GM) crops have delivered significant yield gains for certain commodities in specific contexts, though their adoption remains politically contested, particularly in Europe.

**Sustainable intensification** seeks to increase production while minimising environmental impacts. Techniques include conservation agriculture (minimum tillage, cover cropping, crop rotation), precision farming (using data and technology to optimise inputs), and agroforestry (integrating trees with crops and livestock). The **System of Rice Intensification (SRI)**, developed in Madagascar, demonstrates how modified cultivation practices can dramatically increase yields without requiring new seeds or chemicals.

**Extensification**—bringing additional land into agricultural production—offers limited potential given competing land uses and environmental constraints. However, rehabilitating degraded land through restoration techniques represents a significant opportunity. The **Great Green Wall** initiative across the Sahel aims to restore 100 million hectares of degraded land by 2030, simultaneously addressing desertification, food security and climate adaptation.

**Reducing food waste** presents a critical, often overlooked strategy. Approximately one-third of food produced globally is lost or wasted—14% between harvest and retail, and 17% at the retail and consumer levels. In lower-income countries, losses concentrate in post-harvest handling and storage due to inadequate infrastructure. In wealthy countries, waste occurs predominantly at the consumer level due to retail practices, household behaviours and aesthetic standards that reject cosmetically imperfect produce.

### UK Food Security Context

The United Kingdom presents an instructive case study of food security in a wealthy, densely populated, post-industrial society. The UK produces approximately 60% of the food it consumes by value, with the remainder imported. This **food trade deficit** reflects both climate constraints (the UK cannot commercially produce tropical or Mediterranean crops) and historical specialisation—British agriculture focuses on livestock, dairy and temperate cereals while importing fruit, vegetables and processed products.

UK food security has improved dramatically over the past two centuries. The **Corn Laws** repeal (1846) and subsequent trade liberalisation transformed Britain from a grain exporter to a major importer, dependent on colonies and later global markets. This **imperial food system** collapsed during the First and Second World Wars, prompting emergency measures including the **Dig for Victory** campaign and dramatic expansion of domestic production. Post-war agricultural policy prioritised self-sufficiency, achieved through the 1947 Agriculture Act and subsequent subsidies.

Contemporary UK food security rests on complex global supply chains. The **Brexit** transition has introduced friction into these systems, with increased documentation requirements, labour shortages and trade barriers affecting fresh produce availability. The UK government maintains **strategic food reserves** of certain commodities and has contingency plans for supply disruptions, though these mechanisms face scrutiny regarding their adequacy for major crises.

Recent policy attention has focused on **food system resilience**. The 2021 National Food Strategy, commissioned by government and led by Henry Dimbleby, recommended measures to improve diet-related health outcomes, reduce environmental impacts and enhance food security. Proposals included expansion of free school meals, sugar and salt taxes, and land use transformation to prioritise sustainable domestic production. The government's response, published in 2022, adopted some recommendations while rejecting others, illustrating the political challenges of food system reform.

## Water Resource Management

### Global Water Distribution and Scarcity

Water covers approximately 71% of Earth's surface, yet **freshwater** constitutes less than 3% of this total, and the majority is frozen in ice sheets and glaciers. **Liquid freshwater** available for human use represents less than 1% of all water—a remarkably scarce resource given its absolute necessity for life.

The **hydrological cycle** continuously redistributes water globally, but this distribution is profoundly uneven in space and time. Some regions receive abundant precipitation year-round (tropical rainforests, temperate oceanic climates), while others experience chronic water scarcity (deserts, semi-arid regions) or seasonal variability (monsoon climates, Mediterranean regimes). **Physical water scarcity** occurs where natural availability is insufficient to meet demand; **economic water scarcity** exists where water is physically available but infrastructure, governance or financial constraints prevent access.

Approximately 4 billion people experience severe water scarcity for at least one month annually, and 500 million face year-round scarcity. By 2025, the United Nations projects that 1.8 billion people will live in areas with absolute water scarcity, while two-thirds of the global population may face water-stressed conditions. These projections assume current consumption trajectories; improved efficiency and demand management could significantly alter outcomes.

### Water Consumption Patterns

Global freshwater withdrawals total approximately 4,600 cubic kilometres annually, distributed across three major sectors. **Agricultural irrigation** dominates, accounting for roughly 70% of withdrawals and 90% of consumptive use (water not returned to the system). **Industrial use** represents approximately 20%, including manufacturing, cooling for power generation, and mining. **Domestic and municipal use** comprises the remaining 10%, though this share increases with urbanisation and development.

Consumption patterns vary dramatically between countries and development contexts. Per capita water use in wealthy, arid countries (USA, Australia, Gulf States) may exceed 500 litres daily, while populations in water-scarce developing regions survive on less than 50 litres. These disparities reflect differences in diet (meat production is highly water-intensive), industrial activity, infrastructure efficiency and consumption norms.

The concept of **water footprints** quantifies the total freshwater used to produce goods and services, distinguishing between **blue water** (surface and groundwater withdrawals), **green water** (rainwater consumed in crop growth) and **grey water** (water required to dilute pollutants to acceptable levels). This analytical framework reveals how consumption in one location drives water use elsewhere—a t-shirt produced in water-scarce South Asia may embody over 2,000 litres of virtual water consumed in production.

### Water Management Strategies

Effective water management operates across multiple scales and domains. **Supply-side strategies** increase available water through infrastructure including dams, reservoirs, inter-basin transfers and desalination. These engineering approaches have enabled development in arid regions but carry significant environmental and social costs. Large dams displace communities, disrupt river ecosystems and trap sediment that would otherwise replenish deltas and coastal zones.

**Demand management** emphasises efficiency and conservation. **Agricultural efficiency** can be improved through drip irrigation (delivering water directly to plant roots), deficit irrigation (providing only essential water during critical growth phases) and switching to less water-intensive crops. **Industrial efficiency** includes closed-loop systems that recycle water and process modifications that reduce requirements. **Domestic efficiency** encompasses low-flow fixtures, efficient appliances, greywater recycling and behavioural change.

**Governance and institutions** fundamentally shape water outcomes. The **Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM)** approach advocates coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources to maximise economic and social welfare equitably without compromising ecosystem sustainability. Implementation requires appropriate institutional frameworks, stakeholder participation and supportive policy environments—conditions frequently absent in practice.

**Transboundary water management** addresses the 276 river basins and countless aquifers shared by multiple countries. The **UN Watercourses Convention** provides a framework for cooperation, but political tensions over shared water resources persist in regions including the Nile Basin, the Tigris-Euphrates system and the Indus Basin. Climate change will likely intensify these pressures as precipitation patterns shift and glaciers retreat.

### UK Water Management

The United Kingdom presents a paradoxical water geography: abundant rainfall overall, yet significant regional and seasonal scarcity. The **rainfall gradient** from west to east (exceeding 3,000mm annually in parts of Snowdonia and the Scottish Highlands, falling below 600mm in parts of East Anglia) creates pronounced spatial inequalities. **Seasonal variability**—winter rainfall exceeding summer, with potential summer droughts—further complicates management.

UK water resources are managed through a complex institutional framework shaped by the **privatisation** of water and sewerage services in England and Wales in 1989. Prior to privatisation, water supply was the responsibility of regional water authorities, publicly owned entities that combined supply and regulatory functions. The 1989 Water Act separated these functions, creating private water companies for service provision and the **National Rivers Authority** (subsequently the **Environment Agency**) for regulation.

The **economic regulation** of water privatisation was assigned to **Ofwat** (the Water Services Regulation Authority), which sets price limits through five-yearly price reviews. This regulatory model aimed to harness private sector investment and efficiency while protecting consumers from monopoly pricing. The outcomes remain contested: investment in infrastructure increased substantially, but so did bills, dividends and executive compensation.

**Leakage** represents a persistent challenge for UK water management. Approximately 20% of treated water is lost through leaks in the distribution network—roughly 3 billion litres daily. Thames Water, serving London and the Thames Valley, has historically recorded the highest leakage rates, exceeding 600 million litres daily in recent years. The company attributes these losses to London's aging Victorian infrastructure, while critics highlight underinvestment and dividend payments to shareholders.

The **regulatory framework** has evolved to address emerging challenges. The **Water Framework Directive** (transposed from EU legislation) established objectives for achieving "good ecological status" in all water bodies by 2015 (extended to 2027). This ecosystem-focused approach represents a shift from traditional pollution control toward integrated catchment management. However, implementation has been hampered by diffuse pollution from agriculture, inadequate wastewater treatment, and physical modifications to watercourses.

**Drought management** has become increasingly salient as climate change projections suggest more frequent and severe summer droughts in southern and eastern England. The **National Drought Group** coordinates planning across sectors, while water companies maintain **drought plans** specifying escalating response measures. The 2022 drought—the most severe in decades—triggered hosepipe bans affecting millions and raised questions about infrastructure resilience.

**Sewage pollution** has emerged as a major public concern and political issue. **Combined sewer overflows (CSOs)** discharge untreated sewage into rivers during heavy rainfall to prevent system overload. The frequency and volume of these discharges increased substantially, with over 400,000 permitted sewage releases in 2023. Public outrage prompted regulatory investigation, enforcement action and government commitments to increase monitoring and reduce overflows, though the pace and adequacy of improvement remains contested.

## Energy Resources and the Transition

### The UK's Energy Mix

The United Kingdom's energy system has undergone profound transformation over the past half-century, shifting from coal dominance toward natural gas and, increasingly, renewable sources. Understanding this **energy transition** is essential for geography students, as it illustrates interactions between resource geography, technological change, policy interventions and global markets.

In 1980, the UK energy mix comprised approximately **36% coal, 37% oil and 22% natural gas**. This pattern reflected Britain's indigenous coal industry, developed over two centuries of industrialisation, and the emergence of **North Sea oil and gas** production following the 1970s oil shocks. The subsequent decades witnessed the **dash for gas**—a rapid shift toward natural gas for electricity generation following privatisation of the electricity industry and the availability of cheap North Sea gas.

By 2017, the composition had transformed dramatically: **natural gas provided 39%, oil 36%, with coal reduced to under 2%**. This decarbonisation of electricity generation was driven by multiple factors: climate policy (the Climate Change Act 2008 and EU emissions regulations), economic competition (cheap gas and later renewables undercutting coal), and air quality concerns. The UK achieved its first **coal-free day** in 2017 and has operated for extended periods without coal generation since.

**Nuclear power** has maintained a consistent but declining share, providing approximately 15-20% of electricity from the 1990s through the 2010s. The aging **Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR)** fleet is approaching retirement, with only **Sizewell B** (a Pressurised Water Reactor commissioned in 1995) expected to operate beyond 2030. Plans for new nuclear capacity at **Hinkley Point C** (under construction), **Sizewell C** (approved) and potentially **Wylfa Newydd** and **Bradwell B** aim to maintain nuclear's role, though costs and delivery timescales remain contentious.

### Renewable Energy Expansion

The most significant recent development in UK energy has been the dramatic expansion of **renewable sources**. From providing less than 2% of electricity in 1990, renewables exceeded **40% by 2022** and regularly contribute over 50% of generation during favourable conditions. This transformation reflects supportive policy frameworks (the Renewables Obligation, Feed-in Tariffs and now Contracts for Difference), technological cost reductions and abundant domestic resources.

**Offshore wind** has emerged as the UK's renewable flagship technology. The shallow, windy waters of the North Sea provide world-class resources, and the UK has developed the largest offshore wind capacity globally. **Hornsea One**, located 75 miles off the Yorkshire coast, became the world's largest offshore wind farm when fully operational in 2020, with 174 turbines generating up to 1.2 gigawatts—sufficient to power over one million homes. Its successor, **Hornsea Two**, expanded capacity further to 1.32 gigawatts. Together, these projects demonstrate the scale achievable in offshore wind and anchor a growing supply chain supporting thousands of jobs in Yorkshire and the Humber.

The economic geography of offshore wind extends beyond generation to encompass manufacturing, installation and maintenance. Ports including Hull, Grimsby, Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth have been revitalised as offshore wind hubs, with dedicated facilities for turbine component storage, assembly and vessel operations. The **Dogger Bank** development, currently under construction, will ultimately provide 3.6 gigawatts across three phases, representing the largest offshore wind project globally.

**Onshore wind** developed earlier and more rapidly, with capacity concentrated in Scotland, Wales and northern England where wind resources and planning constraints align. Onshore wind remains the cheapest form of electricity generation in the UK, though development has slowed following changes to planning policy in England that effectively prohibited new projects. Scotland continues to expand onshore capacity, with wind frequently providing over 100% of Scottish electricity demand.

**Solar photovoltaic (PV)** capacity has grown exponentially, from negligible levels in 2010 to over 15 gigawatts by 2023. Unlike wind, solar output peaks during summer days when demand is relatively low, creating integration challenges addressed through battery storage, demand response and interconnection. Solar's distributed nature—deployed on rooftops, industrial sites and solar farms—contrasts with wind's concentration in specific locations.

**Bioenergy** contributes approximately 10% of UK electricity, derived from biomass combustion, landfill gas, sewage gas and anaerobic digestion. The **Drax** power station in Yorkshire, once Europe's largest coal plant, has converted four of its six units to biomass, burning wood pellets sourced primarily from North America. This transition remains controversial: supporters cite carbon neutrality (regrowing forests absorb CO2 emitted by combustion), while critics highlight ecosystem impacts, carbon payback periods and the potential for bioenergy to compete with food production.

### Energy Security and Geopolitics

**Energy security**—reliable access to sufficient energy at affordable prices—has returned to policy prominence following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis. The UK, despite North Sea production, has been a net importer of energy since 2004 as domestic oil and gas decline. This import dependency creates exposure to global market volatility and geopolitical disruptions.

The UK's **energy imports** come primarily from Norway (natural gas via pipeline), Qatar (liquefied natural gas—LNG), and diverse oil suppliers. **Interconnectors**—high-voltage cables linking UK electricity grids with neighbouring countries—provide additional flexibility, with capacity to France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Denmark. These connections enable electricity trade, balancing variable renewable output and providing emergency supplies.

The Ukraine crisis prompted a reassessment of energy security strategies. **Domestic production**, previously discouraged by climate commitments, received renewed support with additional North Sea licensing rounds. **Diversification** of LNG suppliers reduced dependence on Russian gas, with increased imports from the United States and Qatar. **Demand reduction** campaigns encouraged efficiency and conservation. **Accelerated renewables deployment** was framed as both climate and security policy.

### Sustainable Energy Futures

Achieving **net-zero greenhouse gas emissions** by 2050, as legislated in the Climate Change Act, requires continued transformation of the energy system. The **Carbon Budgets** established by the Climate Change Committee chart a pathway including near-complete decarbonisation of electricity generation, widespread electrification of transport and heating, and development of **carbon capture and storage (CCS)** and **hydrogen** infrastructure for sectors difficult to electrify.

**Heat decarbonisation** presents particular challenges, as natural gas currently provides approximately 80% of UK heating. Options include **heat pumps** (electric devices extracting warmth from air or ground), **district heating** (centralised systems distributing hot water), **hydrogen** (potentially repurposing existing gas networks), and **electrification** via direct heating or storage heaters. Each pathway faces technical, economic and consumer acceptance hurdles.

**Transport electrification** is progressing through the phase-out of petrol and diesel vehicle sales (scheduled for 2030) and expansion of charging infrastructure. However, electrifying heavy transport, aviation and shipping requires alternative solutions including hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuels and battery technologies beyond current capabilities.

## Sustainable Resource Management

### The Concept of Sustainability

**Sustainable development**, famously defined in the 1987 Brundtland Report as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs," provides the conceptual foundation for contemporary resource management. This definition emphasises **intergenerational equity**—our obligation to preserve resources and environmental quality for those who will inherit the consequences of current decisions.

The **three pillars of sustainability**—environmental, social and economic—provide a framework for assessing resource management strategies. Environmental sustainability requires maintaining ecosystem functions, biodiversity and natural capital. Social sustainability encompasses equity, participation, cultural preservation and human wellbeing. Economic sustainability demands viable, efficient systems that create value without depleting the resource base upon which long-term prosperity depends.

**Planetary boundaries** research identifies thresholds beyond which Earth's systems risk destabilisation. These boundaries include climate change, biosphere integrity, land-system change, freshwater use, biogeochemical flows (nitrogen and phosphorus cycles), ocean acidification, atmospheric aerosol loading, stratospheric ozone depletion and novel entities (pollution). Current resource trajectories exceed several boundaries, suggesting that fundamental transformation is necessary rather than incremental improvement.

### The Circular Economy

The **circular economy** represents an alternative paradigm to the **linear economy** of "take-make-dispose." Circular approaches emphasise **designing out waste**, keeping products and materials in use, and regenerating natural systems. This framework applies to all resource domains: food systems eliminating waste and regenerating soil, water systems recycling and reusing, energy systems transitioning to renewable sources.

**Industrial ecology** applies ecosystem principles to industrial systems, treating waste as input for other processes. **Cradle-to-cradle** design ensures products can be safely returned to biological or technical nutrient cycles. **Product-service systems** shift business models from selling products to providing services—leasing rather than selling, with producers retaining responsibility for end-of-life management.

### Education for Sustainability

Geography education plays a vital role in developing understanding of resource challenges and sustainability. The **National Curriculum** requires students to understand "how human and physical processes interact to influence, and change landscapes, environments and the climate; and how human activity relies on effective functioning of natural systems." Resource management offers concrete contexts for exploring these interactions.

Effective pedagogy employs **enquiry-based learning**, engaging students with real-world data, case studies and contemporary issues. **Systems thinking** helps students understand interconnected resource flows and feedback loops. **Values clarification** and **ethical reasoning** develop capacity to navigate complex trade-offs. **Action-oriented learning** connects classroom study to practical sustainability initiatives within schools and communities.

Assessment of student understanding should evaluate not just factual recall but capacity to analyse resource issues from multiple perspectives, evaluate management strategies, and construct evidence-based arguments. The **GCSE Geography** assessment objectives require application of knowledge to unfamiliar contexts, analysis of issues from various viewpoints, and evaluation of strategies—skills directly applicable to resource management.

### Common Student Misconceptions

Students frequently hold misconceptions about resources requiring explicit address:

- **"The UK has plenty of water"** — true in aggregate but not locally or seasonally; regional scarcity is significant.
- **"Renewable means unlimited"** — renewable resources can be depleted or degraded if extraction exceeds regeneration rates.
- **"Food insecurity only affects poor countries"** — food insecurity exists in the UK through food banks, poverty and dietary deficiencies.
- **"We can just import what we need"** — import dependency creates vulnerability to global market disruptions and geopolitical events.
- **"Technology will solve resource problems"** — technology offers powerful tools but cannot overcome fundamental physical and ecological constraints.

Addressing these misconceptions requires concrete data, case studies challenging assumptions, and explicit attention to scale and distribution.

## Conclusion

Resource management represents one of the defining challenges of the twenty-first century, intersecting with climate change, economic development, geopolitical stability and environmental justice. Geographical understanding—of spatial distributions, human-environment interactions, scale and interconnection—is essential for navigating these challenges.

The cases examined in this resource—the global food system and its inequalities, UK water management through privatisation and its discontents, the energy transition from coal to renewables—illustrate how resource geographies are simultaneously material (concerning physical substances and flows), political (shaped by power and institutions) and contested (subject to competing interpretations and interests).

For educators, resource management offers opportunities to connect classroom learning to students' lived experiences and to urgent contemporary issues. The food they eat, the water they use, the energy powering their devices—all become entry points for geographical enquiry. Developing critical understanding of these systems empowers young people to participate in shaping more sustainable futures.
