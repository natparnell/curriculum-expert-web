# International Comparisons in Geography Education

## Overview and Rationale

International comparisons in geography education serve multiple purposes for curriculum developers, policymakers, and classroom practitioners. Unlike subjects such as mathematics and science, geography does not currently participate in major international assessment programmes such as TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) or PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment). This absence creates both challenges and opportunities for those seeking to benchmark geography curricula against international standards.

The International Geographical Union – Commission on Geographical Education (IGU-CGE) has consistently advocated for comparative research in geography education. Their 2015 International Declaration on Research in Geography Education emphasised that "geography standards and curriculum frameworks provide opportunities for collaborative studies, as this is the case with well-established curricula." Partnership projects between subject associations and organisations across different nations can enable developments in methodology, allowing researchers to consider and communicate internationally regarding the goals and practices of geographical education.

For UK geography teachers, understanding international approaches offers valuable perspectives on curriculum design, pedagogical innovation, and assessment methodologies. The Geographical Association and Royal Geographical Society have both contributed to comparative research, recognising that while contexts differ significantly, certain universal principles underpin effective geography education worldwide.

## The Absence of Geography from International Assessments

### TIMSS and PISA Limitations

TIMSS focuses on curriculum-based, grade-level achievements in mathematics and science, measuring traditional classroom content such as understanding of fractions, decimals, and their relationships. PISA, conversely, emphasises age-based competencies applicable to real-world contexts and lifelong learning. Neither assessment currently includes geography as a domain.

This absence means that geography lacks the comparative data available to mathematics and science colleagues. As Chang et al. (2018) noted, "Geography is a subject that does not have an international standard for the purpose of measuring learning, knowledge, skills." Consequently, comparative research in geography relies on curriculum document analysis, qualitative research methodologies, and professional dialogue between subject associations rather than standardised testing data.

### Implications for Policy and Practice

The lack of international assessment data has significant implications. Without PISA-style rankings, geography education avoids the "high-stakes" pressures experienced by mathematics and science, where league table positioning can drive curriculum narrowing. However, this also means that geography struggles to demonstrate its contribution to broader educational goals such as global competence, environmental literacy, and spatial thinking in internationally comparable ways.

Policy makers in England have occasionally considered entering regions separately in PISA trials, reflecting recognition that aggregated national data may mask significant regional variations in attainment. This consideration parallels discussions in geography education about whether assessment frameworks adequately capture the subject's distinctive contributions to student learning.

## Comparative Analysis of National Curricula

### England: The National Curriculum Framework

The English National Curriculum for geography, established in its current form in 2013 and subsequently amended, provides a statutory framework that emphasises locational knowledge, place knowledge, human and physical geography, and geographical skills and fieldwork. The curriculum specifies content at Key Stages 1-3, with GCSE and A Level specifications developed by awarding organisations within parameters set by Ofqual.

Key characteristics of the English approach include:

- **Prescriptive content requirements** at each key stage, particularly regarding locational knowledge of the UK and the wider world
- **Integration of fieldwork** as a statutory requirement, reflecting the Royal Geographical Society's emphasis on experiential learning
- **Distinctive separation** of human and physical geography at Key Stage 3, with synthesis encouraged at GCSE and A Level
- **Assessment through terminal examinations** at GCSE and A Level, with coursework elements removed from most specifications in 2016 reforms

The Geographical Association's curriculum progression frameworks provide additional guidance, offering "clear statements about end of Key Stage 1-3 expectations" that allow teachers to "benchmark progress across and between key stages and other schools."

### Finland: Integrated Environmental Studies

Finnish geography education demonstrates markedly different organisational principles. In the first through fourth grades (ages 7-11), geography is taught through "Environmental and Natural Studies"—an integrated subject encompassing biology, geography, physics, chemistry, and health education. This reflects the Finnish emphasis on phenomenon-based learning and interdisciplinary approaches.

At lower secondary level (grades 7-9), geography emerges as a discrete subject, though many teachers hold biology as their main subject with geography as their second subject in their academic degree. Key features include:

- **Phenomenon-based curriculum organisation** in primary years, with geography embedded within broader environmental understanding
- **Gradual specialisation** as students progress through the system
- **Strong emphasis on sustainability** and environmental citizenship across all phases
- **Teacher autonomy** in curriculum implementation, with national frameworks providing broad objectives rather than detailed content specifications

Research by Riihelä and others has traced Finnish geography curriculum development from the 1970s to the present, demonstrating how "international trends have been applied to national contexts in co-operation among academics, administrators and school teachers depending on policies and educational systems of the country, time and reform movements."

### Singapore: High-Performance Geography Education

Singapore's geography curriculum operates within an education system consistently ranked among the world's highest performers in international assessments. Geography is offered as an elective subject at upper secondary and junior college levels, with a rigorous focus on both content mastery and application.

The Singapore approach emphasises:

- **Structured progression** from foundational concepts to advanced application
- **Strong emphasis on examination preparation** within a highly competitive educational environment
- **Integration of geographical investigation** as a required component at advanced levels
- **Regional focus** on Southeast Asia while maintaining global awareness

Singapore's geography education exemplifies what the IGU-CGE has described as the need for "global and international awareness in several distinct ways," examining key global issues while considering examples and detailed case studies at a variety of scales.

### Australia: Humanities and Social Sciences Integration

The Australian Curriculum: Geography, implemented through the Humanities and Social Sciences (HASS) learning area, aims to ensure that students develop "a sense of wonder, curiosity and respect about places, people, cultures and environments throughout the world." The curriculum explicitly addresses what it describes as "increasing global integration and international mobility" as critical to "the wellbeing and sustainability of the environment and society."

Distinctive features include:

- **Integration within HASS** in primary years, with geography as a distinct subject from Year 7 onwards
- **Explicit Asia focus**, reflecting Australia's regional position and relationships
- **Cross-curriculum priorities** including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures, Asia and Australia's engagement with Asia, and sustainability
- **Version 9.0 revisions** (2022) that strengthened content about First Nations histories and cultures and enhanced coverage of climate change and sustainability

Research comparing Australian curriculum with other jurisdictions has identified four common themes across geography curricula worldwide: engagement, connection, change, and sustainability. These themes provide a useful framework for comparative analysis.

### United States: Advanced Placement and Varied State Standards

Geography education in the United States operates within a decentralised system where individual states establish curriculum standards. The Advanced Placement (AP) Human Geography programme offers one nationally recognised benchmark, though its reach varies significantly by state and district.

AP Human Geography has grown substantially, becoming what the American Association of Geographers (AAG) describes as "a good stepping-stone to the AP experience," with many schools offering it in 9th grade as an introduction to advanced coursework. Characteristics include:

- **Varying state requirements**, with some states mandating geography courses and others integrating geography within social studies
- **AP Human Geography** as the primary advanced pathway, emphasising human geography concepts and spatial analysis
- **Geographic Alliance Networks** supporting teacher professional development across states
- **National Geography Standards** (1994, revised 2012) providing voluntary guidance rather than statutory requirements

The AAG has called for reappraisal of AP Human Geography, noting its unique position as an AP course accessible to younger students while questioning whether its rapid expansion has maintained appropriate rigour.

### New Zealand: NCEA and Place-Based Learning

New Zealand's geography curriculum operates within the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) framework. Geography aims to "develop an understanding of the environment as the home of people," studying the characteristics and processes of both natural and cultural environments.

Key characteristics include:

- **NCEA Levels 1-3** providing structured progression with internally and externally assessed standards
- **Strong Māori dimension** through integration of indigenous knowledge and perspectives
- **Emphasis on geographic skills** including mapping, graphing, and fieldwork investigation
- **Place-based focus** with strong emphasis on New Zealand contexts while maintaining international awareness

The NCEA system offers flexibility in course construction while maintaining standards that are "accepted internationally," though overseas institutions set their own requirements for recognition.

### Canada: Provincial Variation

Canadian geography education operates at provincial rather than federal level, resulting in significant variation across the country's ten provinces and three territories. Ontario and British Columbia represent contrasting approaches:

**Ontario:**
- Geography integrated within Canadian and World Studies curriculum
- Specific courses in Issues in Canadian Geography (Grade 9) and Travel and Tourism (Grade 11)
- Strong emphasis on citizenship education alongside geographical content

**British Columbia:**
- Geography integrated within Social Studies curriculum through Grade 10
- Specialised geography courses available at senior secondary level
- Strong emphasis on local and regional contexts, particularly environmental geography

Provincial variation creates challenges for comparative research, though common themes emerge around environmental education, citizenship, and spatial thinking.

## Common Themes in International Geography Education

### Four Universal Themes

Comparative research by Chang et al. (2018) identified four themes common across diverse geography curricula:

**1. Engagement**
Effective geography curricula engage students with real-world issues, fostering curiosity about places, environments, and human interactions. This manifests in varying ways—from England's statutory fieldwork requirements to Finland's phenomenon-based approaches—but the principle of active, experiential learning runs throughout.

**2. Connection**
Understanding relationships between local and global scales characterises geography education worldwide. The Australian Curriculum explicitly addresses this through its Asia focus, while England's curriculum requires knowledge of both UK and global contexts.

**3. Change**
Geographical processes of change—environmental, social, economic, and political—provide organising frameworks across curricula. New Zealand's NCEA standards explicitly assess understanding of geographic patterns and processes, while the English curriculum requires study of change over time.

**4. Sustainability**
Environmental sustainability features prominently in all major geography curricula, reflecting the subject's unique position bridging natural and social sciences. Finland's integrated Environmental and Natural Studies places sustainability at its core, while recent revisions to the Australian Curriculum strengthened climate change coverage.

### Pedagogical Approaches

Despite curricular differences, certain pedagogical approaches characterise effective geography teaching internationally:

**Enquiry-Based Learning**
The Geographical Association describes enquiry as fundamental to effective geography teaching. Australian and English curricula explicitly incorporate enquiry frameworks, while Finnish phenomenon-based learning represents an advanced form of enquiry pedagogy.

**Fieldwork and Experiential Learning**
From England's statutory fieldwork requirements to New Zealand's emphasis on local context, direct experience of environments remains central to geography education. The Royal Geographical Society's fieldwork guidance influences practice beyond UK borders.

**Spatial Thinking and Geospatial Technologies**
All major curricula increasingly emphasise mapping, GIS, and spatial analysis skills. The ubiquity of digital mapping tools has transformed expectations for student geographical skills across jurisdictions.

**Critical Thinking and Values Education**
Geography education internationally addresses contested issues including climate change, migration, and development. The IGU-CGE's commitment to "achieving human potential through geography education" reflects shared aspirations for the subject's contribution to ethical citizenship.

## Pedagogical Implications for UK Teachers

### Curriculum Design Insights

Comparative analysis offers several insights for UK geography teachers designing curricula:

**Integration vs. Specialisation**
Finland's integrated approach in primary years suggests possibilities for cross-curricular geography that maintains disciplinary rigour. UK teachers might explore stronger connections with science (environmental systems), mathematics (data handling), and English (communication of findings) without sacrificing geographical integrity.

**Phenomenon-Based Possibilities**
While the English National Curriculum prescribes content, the Finnish model demonstrates how phenomenon-based approaches can organise learning around compelling questions rather than discrete topics. Teachers might experiment with enquiry questions that genuinely require integration of locational knowledge, place understanding, and geographical skills.

**Asia-Pacific Perspectives**
Australia's explicit Asia focus reflects geographical realities of trade, migration, and environmental interdependence. UK curricula might similarly strengthen Asian case studies, recognising Britain's historical and contemporary connections with the region.

### Assessment Methodologies

International comparison reveals diverse assessment approaches from which UK practice might learn:

**NCEA's Flexible Standards**
New Zealand's mix of internal and external assessment, with standards assessing specific skills and understandings, offers a model of granular progression tracking that contrasts with England's terminal examination focus.

**AP Human Geography's Accessibility**
The growth of AP Human Geography among younger students suggests possibilities for more accessible advanced geography that builds examination skills progressively rather than concentrating assessment at course conclusion.

**Finnish Portfolio Approaches**
While Finland lacks standardised testing in geography, teacher-assessed portfolios and phenomenon-based projects offer alternative models of capturing student learning that might inform UK formative assessment practices.

### Professional Development Opportunities

International comparison supports professional development through:

**Exchange and Collaboration**
The IGU-CGE facilitates international collaboration between geography educators. UK teachers might engage with European networks, Commonwealth partnerships, or bilateral arrangements with specific jurisdictions.

**Resources and Case Studies**
Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand geography education resources offer alternative perspectives on familiar topics. The Australian Curriculum's extensive elaborations and work samples provide particularly rich materials for adaptation.

**Research Engagement**
Comparative research published in journals such as *International Research in Geographical and Environmental Education* offers evidence bases for curriculum decisions, though teachers should remain critically aware of contextual differences.

## Challenges in International Comparison

### Contextual Differences

Effective comparison requires acknowledging profound contextual differences:

**Scale and Diversity**
Comparing England (population 56 million) with Finland (5.5 million) or Singapore (5.9 million) raises questions about transferability. Curriculum structures feasible in small, relatively homogeneous populations may require significant adaptation for larger, more diverse contexts.

**Historical and Cultural Factors**
Geography's disciplinary status varies internationally. In England, geography has maintained relatively strong position in the curriculum since 1988; in some US states, geography struggles for recognition within crowded social studies frameworks.

**Assessment Cultures**
High-stakes examination cultures (England, Singapore) produce different pedagogical effects from systems emphasising teacher assessment (Finland) or portfolio approaches (New Zealand).

### Methodological Limitations

Comparative geography education research faces methodological challenges:

**Document vs. Practice Gaps**
Curriculum documents may poorly represent classroom practice. Official frameworks emphasising enquiry learning may coexist with didactic teaching where assessment pressures or resource limitations constrain pedagogical possibilities.

**Translation and Interpretation**
Curriculum concepts do not translate directly between languages and educational cultures. Finnish "phenomenon-based learning" or Australian "cross-curriculum priorities" represent complex constructs that resist simple transplantation.

**Data Availability**
Without international assessment data, comparative research relies on self-reported data, small-scale studies, and curriculum document analysis—methodologies with inherent limitations.

## Future Directions

### Potential for Geography in International Assessments

The IGU-CGE continues advocating for geography's inclusion in international assessment programmes. While significant barriers remain—including definitional debates about geographical content and the practical challenges of cross-cultural assessment—ongoing developments in PISA's global competence framework and environmental literacy assessments may create openings for geographical content.

### Emerging Themes

Several themes are likely to shape international geography education in coming years:

**Climate Change Education**
All jurisdictions face pressure to strengthen climate change coverage. Geography's position bridging physical and human dimensions makes it central to these developments.

**Digital Geographies**
The transformation of spatial experience through digital technologies—navigation apps, location-based services, virtual globes—raises new questions for curriculum content and pedagogical approaches.

**Decolonising the Curriculum**
Australian and New Zealand developments in incorporating indigenous knowledge offer models that may influence UK approaches to decolonising geographical education.

**Global Competence**
OECD frameworks emphasising global competence align closely with geography's traditional concerns, potentially strengthening the subject's position in curricula worldwide.

## Conclusion

International comparison in geography education offers valuable perspectives while requiring careful contextual interpretation. The absence of geography from PISA and TIMSS creates both freedom from high-stakes pressures and challenges in demonstrating the subject's contribution to broader educational goals.

Common themes—engagement, connection, change, and sustainability—unite diverse curricula, while pedagogical approaches including enquiry-based learning, fieldwork, and spatial thinking characterise effective geography teaching internationally.

For UK geography teachers, comparative analysis supports informed curriculum design, professional development, and advocacy for the subject's unique contribution to young people's education. As the International Declaration on Research in Geography Education emphasises, partnership projects between subject associations and organisations across different nations enable developments in methodology and practice that ultimately benefit students worldwide.

The challenge remains to engage with international perspectives critically—neither rejecting them as irrelevant to English contexts nor accepting them uncritically as models for transplantation. Through thoughtful comparison, UK geography educators can strengthen their practice while contributing to the global development of geographical education.
