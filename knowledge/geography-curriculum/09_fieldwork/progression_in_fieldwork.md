# Progression in Fieldwork: Building Skills from EYFS to KS5

## Introduction: The Centrality of Fieldwork in Geography

Fieldwork is not merely an enrichment activity in geography education—it is the discipline's defining pedagogical practice. The Royal Geographical Society (RGS) describes fieldwork as "the process of observing, questioning and investigating geographical phenomena in the real world" (RGS, 2023). This practical engagement transforms abstract concepts into tangible understanding, allowing pupils to develop the disciplinary habits of mind that characterise geographical thinking.

The Ofsted inspection framework places significant emphasis on fieldwork provision, recognising it as a key indicator of curriculum quality in geography. Schools preparing for deep dive inspections must demonstrate not merely that fieldwork occurs, but that it is carefully sequenced, progressively developed, and integral to the curriculum rather than an optional add-on (Headteacher Update, 2024).

This knowledge file examines the progression of fieldwork skills from the Early Years Foundation Stage through to A-Level, considering how each phase builds upon prior learning while introducing new techniques, conceptual frameworks, and levels of independence. Understanding this progression is essential for curriculum leaders seeking to ensure coherent development of geographical practice across their schools or trusts.

## EYFS: Foundations of Geographical Observation

### The Early Learning Goals Context

Whilst the EYFS Statutory Framework does not explicitly mention geography as a discrete subject, the "Understanding the World" area of learning provides the essential foundations for future fieldwork. Children are expected to:

- Explore the natural world around them
- Describe what they see, hear, and feel whilst outside
- Understand some important processes and changes in the natural world
- Recognise some environments that are different to the one in which they live

These early experiences of observation, description, and comparison form the cognitive foundations upon which later fieldwork skills are built. The Geographical Association (GA) emphasises that "young children are natural geographers" with an innate curiosity about their environment that should be nurtured through structured outdoor experiences (GA, 2025).

### Pedagogical Approaches in EYFS

Effective early fieldwork experiences in EYFS share several characteristics:

**Sensory Exploration**: Young children learn through direct sensory engagement. Activities such as bark rubbing, listening walks, and texture hunts develop observational skills whilst building vocabulary for describing the physical environment. The Forestry England recommends using simple prompts such as "What can you see? What can you hear? What does it feel like?" to scaffold observations (Forestry England, 2024).

**Local Environment Focus**: EYFS fieldwork should centre on the immediate environment—school grounds, local parks, and the neighbourhood. HFL Education (2025) notes that "children may begin to understand some of the properties of the physical environment" through repeated, purposeful visits to familiar places.

**Play-Based Investigation**: The GA suggests using small-world play to extend fieldwork thinking. For example, after exploring the school grounds, children might use Lego figures to recreate natural environments including forests, rivers, and grasslands, thereby developing early mapping and spatial reasoning skills (GA, 2025).

**Documentation and Recording**: Even at this early stage, children can begin to record their observations through drawing, photography, and simple tally charts. These foundational data collection practices prepare them for more systematic approaches in Key Stage 1.

## KS1: Developing Systematic Observation

### National Curriculum Requirements

The National Curriculum for Geography at KS1 explicitly requires that pupils "use simple fieldwork and observational skills to study the geography of their school and its grounds and the key human and physical features of its surrounding environment" (DfE, 2013). This statutory requirement establishes fieldwork as a core component of primary geography rather than an optional extra.

### Skill Development in KS1

**Structured Observation**: Building on EYFS sensory exploration, KS1 pupils develop more systematic observation techniques. This includes using simple observation frames ("I can see... I notice... I wonder...") and beginning to categorise features as human or physical.

**Basic Data Collection**: Children learn to collect simple data through tallying, pictograms, and simple surveys. For example, they might count different types of vehicles passing the school, record weather observations over time, or survey classmates about their journey to school.

**Mapping Skills**: KS1 fieldwork should be closely linked to developing mapping competence. Pupils create simple plans of the school grounds, add features to base maps, and begin using directional language (left, right, forwards, backwards) and simple compass directions (North, South, East, West).

**Question Formation**: The enquiry process begins with children learning to ask geographical questions. Teachers model question types: "What is this place like?" "How is it changing?" "Why is it like this?" "How is it connected to other places?"

### Practical Implementation

Learning through Landscapes (2023) recommends that KS1 fieldwork should:
- Be frequent and brief rather than occasional and lengthy
- Focus on the school grounds and immediate locality
- Integrate with other curriculum areas, particularly science and mathematics
- Involve all pupils actively rather than passive observation
- Include opportunities for pupils to present their findings to others

## KS2: Deepening Enquiry and Independence

### Expanding Geographical Skills

As pupils progress through KS2, fieldwork becomes more sophisticated in scope and methodology:

**Extended Enquiries**: Rather than one-off data collection exercises, KS2 pupils engage in sustained enquiries that span multiple lessons. For example, a study of the local river might involve preliminary mapping, hypothesis formation, data collection at multiple sites, analysis, and presentation of findings.

**Methodological Range**: Pupils encounter a wider range of fieldwork techniques including:
- Environmental quality surveys
- Land use mapping and classification
- Traffic and pedestrian counts
- Weather monitoring using instruments
- Bi-polar surveys and decision-making exercises
- Questionnaire design and conduct

**Data Handling**: There is increased emphasis on data presentation and simple analysis. Pupils learn to construct bar charts, line graphs, and scatter graphs from field data; calculate means and ranges; and identify patterns and anomalies.

**Comparative Study**: The National Curriculum requires pupils to "understand geographical similarities and differences through the study of human and physical geography of a region of the United Kingdom, a region in a European country, and a region in North or South America." Fieldwork supports this by enabling comparison between the local area and distant places through virtual fieldwork or parallel studies.

### The Enquiry Process

The GA's "Route for Geographical Enquiry" provides a framework for structuring KS2 fieldwork:

1. **Question/Hypothesis**: What do we want to find out? What do we think we will discover?
2. **Planning**: What data do we need? How will we collect it? What equipment is required?
3. **Data Collection**: Systematic recording using appropriate techniques
4. **Presentation**: Organising data through maps, graphs, and diagrams
5. **Analysis**: What does the data show? Are there patterns?
6. **Conclusion**: Answering the original question or testing the hypothesis
7. **Evaluation**: How reliable are our findings? What would we do differently?

### Preparing for Transition

By the end of KS2, pupils should be capable of:
- Planning simple fieldwork investigations with minimal scaffolding
- Selecting appropriate methods for data collection
- Working collaboratively in the field
- Presenting findings in multiple formats
- Beginning to evaluate the reliability and limitations of their data

These capabilities provide essential preparation for the more demanding requirements of secondary geography.

## KS3: Transition and Deepening Complexity

### Bridging the Primary-Secondary Divide

The transition from primary to secondary geography represents a significant step-change in fieldwork expectations. OFSTED research has identified that gaps in fieldwork provision at KS3 can undermine progression, with some secondary schools assuming—incorrectly—that pupils have limited prior experience (TES, 2025).

Effective KS3 curricula build upon primary foundations whilst introducing new conceptual and technical demands:

**Conceptual Frameworks**: Fieldwork becomes explicitly linked to geographical theory. Pupils might investigate urban microclimates whilst studying climate; examine river processes through field measurement; or explore deprivation indices in the local area whilst studying development.

**Technical Proficiency**: Pupils develop competence with field equipment including:
- Anemometers and digital weather stations
- River flow meters and clinometers
- Soil testing kits
- Digital cameras and voice recorders for qualitative data
- Mobile technologies and GIS applications

**Sampling Strategies**: Understanding of data collection becomes more sophisticated. Pupils learn about random, systematic, and stratified sampling; recognise the importance of sample size; and begin to understand concepts of reliability and validity.

**Risk Assessment**: Formal consideration of health and safety becomes embedded in planning. Pupils participate in risk assessment processes, learning to identify hazards and implement control measures.

### The Role of Residential Fieldwork

Many schools introduce residential fieldwork at KS3, typically to contrasting physical environments such as coastal or river landscapes. These extended experiences enable:
- Immersive engagement with geographical processes
- Collection of larger datasets over time and space
- Development of independence and resilience
- Teamwork and collaboration in challenging conditions

The GA recommends that residential fieldwork should have clear learning objectives beyond "experience of the environment" and should be carefully integrated with classroom learning both before and after the visit.

## KS4/GCSE: Compulsory Fieldwork and Assessment

### Statutory Requirements

The DfE Subject Content for GCSE Geography (2014) mandates that all students must undertake fieldwork on at least two occasions—one investigating physical geography and one investigating human geography. These requirements are not merely advisory; they are assessed through examination questions that constitute approximately 10% of the total marks.

AQA, Eduqas, and OCR specifications all require that fieldwork:
- Includes exploration of physical and human processes
- Involves collection of primary physical and human data
- Addresses the interactions between physical and human processes
- Applies enquiry and investigative approaches to questions and hypotheses

### The GCSE Enquiry Model

Awarding Organisations have developed structured approaches to fieldwork enquiry that inform teaching and assessment:

**AQA's Enquiry Sequence** comprises:
1. Preparing for fieldwork (contextual understanding, research)
2. Collecting primary data (selection and use of appropriate techniques)
3. Applying knowledge and understanding to fieldwork contexts
4. Presentation and analysis of fieldwork data
5. Drawing evidenced conclusions and evaluating findings

**Assessment Focus**: Examination questions test:
- Understanding of the purpose and context of fieldwork
- Knowledge of data collection methods and their limitations
- Ability to present and analyse field data
- Capacity to draw conclusions and evaluate reliability

### Developing Independence

By GCSE, pupils should be capable of substantial independence in fieldwork:
- Formulating their own hypotheses and questions
- Designing appropriate methodologies
- Recognising and mitigating sources of error
- Selecting appropriate presentation and analysis techniques
- Writing extended evaluations that consider reliability, validity, and limitations

## KS5/A-Level: Independent Investigation

### The Non-Examined Assessment (NEA)

A-Level Geography includes an independent investigation (NEA) worth 20% of the total A-Level. This substantial piece of work requires students to:

- Define their own research question or hypothesis
- Design and undertake a fieldwork investigation
- Collect primary and secondary data
- Analyse and interpret findings using appropriate geographical theory
- Write a 3,000-4,000 word report

### Advanced Fieldwork Skills

The NEA demands sophisticated fieldwork capabilities:

**Research Design**: Students must independently design robust research methodologies, justify their choices, and demonstrate awareness of limitations and ethical considerations.

**Data Collection**: Investigations typically involve multiple data collection techniques, often across extended time periods or spatial scales. Students must show independence in organising and conducting fieldwork.

**Statistical Analysis**: Quantitative investigations require appropriate statistical testing (chi-squared, Spearman's rank, Mann-Whitney U, etc.) with correct interpretation of significance.

**Theoretical Integration**: Strong NEAs explicitly connect field findings to geographical theory and models, using empirical evidence to support, refine, or challenge established concepts.

**Academic Writing**: The written report follows conventions of academic geography, with appropriate referencing, critical analysis, and structured argumentation.

### Preparing for Undergraduate Study

The A-Level NEA serves as valuable preparation for undergraduate geography, where independent research becomes central to the discipline. Universities frequently comment that students with strong NEA experiences transition more successfully to degree-level study.

## Common Misconceptions and Challenges

### Pupil Misconceptions

Research and classroom experience reveal several common misconceptions about fieldwork:

**"Fieldwork is just a day out"**: Pupils may perceive fieldwork as recreational rather than educational. Addressing this requires clear learning objectives, explicit connection to classroom content, and rigorous follow-up work.

**"Bigger samples are always better"**: While sample size matters, pupils often fail to understand that representativeness and appropriate sampling strategies are equally important.

**"Primary data is always better"**: Pupils may undervalue secondary sources, not recognising that well-collected secondary data can be more reliable than hastily gathered primary data.

**"Results prove or disprove hypotheses"**: The tentative nature of geographical knowledge is often lost; pupils need support to understand that findings may be inconclusive or suggest modified hypotheses.

### Curriculum Challenges

Schools face several systemic challenges in delivering progression:

**Time Constraints**: Fieldwork is time-intensive. Schools must balance the benefits of extended fieldwork against competing curriculum demands.

**Cost and Access**: Residential fieldwork at KS4 and KS5 can be expensive, potentially creating inequitable access. Virtual fieldwork and local alternatives can help, though they provide different learning experiences.

**Health and Safety**: Risk management requirements can constrain fieldwork opportunities. However, the GA notes that "the answer is not to remove fieldwork but to manage risks appropriately" (GA, 2024).

**Teacher Confidence**: Some teachers—particularly non-specialists in primary settings—lack confidence in leading fieldwork. Professional development and accessible resources are essential.

## Pedagogical Approaches for Effective Fieldwork

### Before the Fieldwork

Effective fieldwork requires substantial preparation:

**Contextual Knowledge**: Pupils need sufficient background understanding to recognise the significance of what they observe. Fieldwork should never be pupils' first encounter with a concept.

**Equipment Familiarisation**: Time spent practising with equipment in the classroom prevents confusion and error in the field.

**Question and Hypothesis Formation**: Where possible, pupils should participate in defining what they will investigate, developing ownership of the enquiry.

### During the Fieldwork

**Structured Independence**: Pupils need enough scaffolding to succeed but sufficient autonomy to develop independence. This balance shifts progressively from KS1 to KS5.

**Real-Time Processing**: Opportunities to review and reflect during fieldwork—rather than waiting until back in the classroom—enable immediate adjustments and deeper engagement.

**Collaborative Learning**: Fieldwork provides rich opportunities for peer learning, with pupils supporting each other in data collection and problem-solving.

### After the Fieldwork

The period following fieldwork is crucial for learning:

**Prompt Processing**: Data should be organised and initial analysis completed whilst memories are fresh.

**Connection to Theory**: Explicit links should be made between field observations and classroom learning, answering the question "What does this tell us about geography?"

**Presentation and Communication**: Pupils should present findings to audiences, developing communication skills and accountability for the quality of their work.

**Evaluation**: Reflection on what worked, what didn't, and why develops metacognitive awareness and improves future fieldwork.

## Assessment and Progression Tracking

### Monitoring Progression

Curriculum leaders should monitor fieldwork progression systematically:

**Audit Coverage**: Ensure that pupils experience the full range of fieldwork techniques appropriate to their key stage across their time in school.

**Track Participation**: Monitor that all pupils—not just enthusiastic volunteers—participate fully in fieldwork opportunities.

**Assess Outcomes**: Use assessment criteria that explicitly recognise fieldwork skills, not just written outputs.

**Evaluate Quality**: Periodically review the quality of fieldwork provision, seeking pupil feedback and observing practice.

### Ofsted Considerations

In geography deep dives, inspectors typically explore:
- How fieldwork is sequenced across the curriculum
- Whether fieldwork builds progressively on prior learning
- How pupils' understanding of fieldwork techniques develops over time
- Whether assessment captures fieldwork skills effectively
- How the school ensures equitable access to fieldwork opportunities

Schools should be prepared to demonstrate clear progression maps, lesson sequences, and assessment evidence.

## Resources and Professional Support

### Key Organisations

**The Geographical Association (GA)**: Offers extensive fieldwork resources, professional development, and guidance for all key stages. The GA's "Fieldwork through Enquiry" materials provide particularly valuable support (geography.org.uk).

**The Royal Geographical Society (RGS)**: Provides subject content expertise, research updates, and resources for both primary and secondary fieldwork (rgs.org).

**Learning through Landscapes**: Specialises in outdoor learning and school grounds fieldwork, with free resources for EYFS and primary settings (ltl.org.uk).

**Field Studies Council (FSC)**: Offers residential centres, professional development, and digital resources supporting fieldwork across all phases.

### Digital Resources

Virtual fieldwork resources—including 360° videos, interactive maps, and data sets—can supplement but not replace physical fieldwork. They are particularly valuable for:
- Preparing pupils for physical fieldwork
- Accessing distant or hazardous environments
- Supporting pupils who cannot participate in physical fieldwork
- Revisiting fieldwork locations for further analysis

## Conclusion

Progression in fieldwork is a carefully constructed journey from the sensory exploration of EYFS to the independent investigation of A-Level. At each stage, pupils build upon prior capabilities while encountering new challenges that demand greater independence, technical competence, and conceptual sophistication.

Effective curriculum leaders understand this progression as an integrated whole, ensuring that experiences in each key stage prepare pupils for what follows. They resist the
