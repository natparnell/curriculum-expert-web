# Digital Fieldwork and Virtual Alternatives

Digital fieldwork represents a transformative approach to geographical education, encompassing Geographic Information Systems (GIS), virtual field trips, mobile data collection technologies, and blended learning approaches that combine physical and digital experiences. The integration of digital tools into fieldwork practice has expanded rapidly, accelerated by necessity during the COVID-19 pandemic and sustained by recognition of its pedagogical value, accessibility benefits, and capacity to enhance geographical understanding.

## The Role of GIS in Fieldwork

Geographic Information Systems have become integral to contemporary geography fieldwork, enabling students to collect, analyse, and visualise spatial data with unprecedented sophistication. The Geographical Association (GA) emphasises that GIS should be used throughout primary and secondary schools with clear progression in the challenge required, supporting both the collection of field data and subsequent analysis that reveals patterns and relationships not immediately visible through observation alone.

### ArcGIS Online for Schools

Esri UK's Teach with GIS programme provides free access to ArcGIS Online for all UK schools as part of their corporate social responsibility work. This cloud-based mapping platform offers teachers multiscale, high-quality local maps including Ordnance Survey data alongside global maps that support locational knowledge and geographical enquiry. ArcGIS Online enables students to collect field data using mobile devices, upload observations to shared maps, and perform spatial analysis that transforms raw data into geographical insight.

The platform's fieldwork applications include creating interactive story maps that document field investigations, performing proximity analysis to explore relationships between geographical phenomena, and generating heat maps that reveal spatial patterns in collected data. Students can layer multiple datasets—field observations, demographic data, environmental measurements—to develop sophisticated understandings of place complexity. The collaborative features allow classes to contribute to shared fieldwork datasets, enabling larger sample sizes and more robust analysis than individual collection would permit.

### Digimap for Schools

Digimap for Schools, provided by EDINA at the University of Edinburgh in partnership with Ordnance Survey, offers an award-winning online mapping service specifically designed for educational use. The platform provides current and historical Ordnance Survey maps alongside contemporary aerial photographs, supporting cross-curricular teaching while developing critical digital and data skills. Ordnance Survey has committed to providing free access to Digimap for Schools for over 1,800 primary and secondary schools serving deprived areas, recognising the resource's capacity to enrich curriculum learning and put data analysis directly into pupils' hands.

In fieldwork contexts, Digimap for Schools enables students to gather information outside the classroom and upload it onto digital maps where they can identify patterns, measure distances and areas, and compare historical and contemporary landscapes. The platform's annotation tools support hypothesis formation and testing, while the ability to overlay multiple map layers facilitates investigation of relationships between physical and human geographical features. The historical map layers are particularly valuable for change-over-time investigations, allowing students to quantify urban expansion, coastal erosion, or land use transformation.

### Progression in GIS Fieldwork Skills

The GA advocates for systematic progression in GIS fieldwork capabilities across key stages. At Key Stage 1 and 2, students might use simple digital mapping tools to record field observations, add photographs to map locations, and create basic visualisations of data collected during local investigations. Key Stage 3 students should develop capabilities in data input and editing of spatial data, using GIS to support fieldwork applications such as recording precise locations, layering multiple datasets, and performing basic spatial queries.

At GCSE and A Level, students should employ GIS for sophisticated fieldwork analysis including spatial statistics, interpolation of point data to create continuous surfaces, network analysis for transportation or river studies, and 3D visualisation of terrain data. The capacity to export data from fieldwork apps into GIS platforms for detailed analysis represents an important threshold skill, enabling students to handle the authentic messy data of real geographical investigation rather than the sanitised datasets of textbook exercises.

## Virtual Field Trips: Characteristics and Applications

Virtual field trips (VFTs) are digital alternatives to in-person visits that allow for virtual navigation through space via digital platforms and tools. As Friess et al. (2016) and subsequent researchers have documented, VFTs have evolved significantly from early photographic panoramas to contemporary immersive experiences that can replicate many elements of outdoor field investigation.

### Types and Technologies

Virtual field trips exist along a continuum from simple to sophisticated. At the basic level, photographic virtual tours using platforms such as Google Street View or dedicated educational sites enable students to observe and navigate through field locations remotely. Video-based virtual field trips incorporate documentary footage, expert commentary, and guided observation exercises that direct student attention to significant features.

More immersive approaches employ 360-degree photography, virtual reality headsets, and interactive 3D environments that provide experiential engagement with field locations. The Royal Geographical Society's resources for virtual fieldwork include guidance on creating and using these varied approaches, recognising that different pedagogical purposes are served by different technological solutions.

H5P interactive content creation tools, centrally supported within many UK universities and increasingly in schools, enable educators to construct virtual tours with built-in digital accessibility features including text descriptions, alternative pathways for different learning needs, and embedded assessment questions that check understanding throughout the virtual experience.

### Pedagogical Value and Limitations

The Royal Geographical Society's principles for field courses establish that virtual fieldwork has significant value in supplementing and enhancing field-based learning but is not normally a substitute for in-situ field learning. The sensory richness of physical fieldwork—the smells, textures, weather conditions, and embodied experience of moving through landscape—cannot be fully replicated digitally. However, virtual approaches offer distinct advantages that complement rather than replace physical fieldwork.

Virtual field trips enable access to locations that would be impossible, impractical, or unsafe to visit physically. Students can explore polar environments, active volcanic zones, or geographically distant locations that would be inaccessible due to cost, time, or safety constraints. Virtual approaches also allow repeated revisiting of field sites, enabling students to check observations, compare conditions across different times, and develop deeper familiarity with the location than a single physical visit would permit.

The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that online delivery using digital tools and technologies was effective for enabling participation for students who faced physical barriers to attendance in the field. Students with mobility impairments, chronic health conditions, or caring responsibilities that prevent residential fieldwork participation can access virtual alternatives that maintain curricular inclusion. However, educators must avoid creating a two-tier system where some students receive rich physical fieldwork experiences while others are confined to virtual substitutes; the principle of inclusive design suggests that virtual elements should enhance provision for all students.

## Google Earth and Spatial Analysis Tools

Google Earth Pro provides free, powerful capabilities for fieldwork preparation, virtual exploration, and data analysis that are accessible to all schools regardless of budget constraints. The Royal Geographical Society has developed extensive guidance on using Google Earth as a fieldwork tool, recognising its particular value for measuring, visualising, and comparing geographical features.

### Measurement and Visualisation Capabilities

Google Earth Pro's measurement tools enable students to calculate straight-line distances between points, measure path lengths along routes, and determine areas of irregular shapes such as land use zones or drainage basins. These capabilities support quantitative fieldwork without requiring expensive equipment—students can collect data virtually that would previously have required trundle wheels, planimeters, or GIS software.

The platform's 3D terrain visualisation supports understanding of physical geography processes, allowing students to view landscapes from multiple perspectives, identify landforms, and understand the relationships between topography and human settlement patterns. The historical imagery feature, where available, enables change-over-time investigations comparing satellite imagery from different dates, supporting quantitative analysis of coastal erosion, urban expansion, or environmental degradation.

### Pre-Fieldwork Preparation

Google Earth is particularly valuable for pre-fieldwork preparation, enabling students to familiarise themselves with investigation sites before physical visits. Students can identify sampling locations, plan data collection routes, anticipate access challenges, and develop initial hypotheses based on observed patterns. This orientation reduces the cognitive load during physical fieldwork, allowing students to focus on data collection and observation rather than navigation and orientation.

The creation of placemarks, paths, and polygons in Google Earth supports structured fieldwork planning. Students can mark proposed sampling points, outline study areas, and annotate expected features, creating a fieldwork plan that guides their physical investigation. The capacity to share these preparations with teachers enables formative assessment of fieldwork planning and appropriate challenge before the physical visit occurs.

## Mobile Devices and Fieldwork Applications

The widespread availability of smartphones and tablets has democratised field data collection, putting sophisticated sensors and recording capabilities into students' hands. Mobile devices incorporate GPS receivers, cameras, accelerometers, and internet connectivity that support diverse fieldwork applications.

### Field Data Collection Apps

Several apps specifically designed for geographical fieldwork are available to schools. Fieldtrip GB, developed by EDINA and built on Ordnance Survey map data, provides structured field data collection capabilities specifically designed for UK geography fieldwork. The app enables students to record observations at precise locations, attach photographs and audio notes, and export data for subsequent analysis in GIS platforms.

ArcGIS Field Maps combines mobile forms, asset inspection capabilities, and location tracking within the Esri ecosystem. The app's offline functionality is particularly valuable for fieldwork in areas with poor mobile connectivity, allowing data collection without continuous internet access and subsequent synchronisation when connectivity returns. This capability extends fieldwork possibilities to remote rural and coastal locations where connectivity cannot be assumed.

Mergin Maps provides a free, open-source alternative for field data collection with an intuitive interface designed to be usable by anyone for capturing field data even without extensive training. The app's collaborative features support group fieldwork, while the QGIS integration enables sophisticated desktop analysis of collected data.

### Using Generic Smartphone Capabilities

Beyond dedicated fieldwork apps, smartphones' generic capabilities support geographical investigation. The GPS functionality enables precise location recording for field observations, while the camera documents features with georeferenced photographs. Voice recording supports immediate reflection and note-taking in the field, capturing thoughts while observations are fresh.

Social media and communication apps can structure collaborative fieldwork, with students sharing observations, photographs, and preliminary findings in real-time. Fearnley and Fyfe (2018) explored the potential of Twitter as a research resource during fieldwork, demonstrating how social networking can enhance learning opportunities and engagement. However, teachers must establish clear protocols for device use to ensure that technological engagement enhances rather than distracts from field observation.

## Remote Sensing and Satellite Imagery

Remote sensing—the acquisition of information about Earth's surface from a distance—provides fieldwork contexts with synoptic views that contextualise local observations within broader spatial patterns. Satellite imagery extends students' fieldwork capabilities beyond the immediate study area, enabling them to understand how their local observations relate to regional and global geographical processes.

### Educational Resources

The USGS EROS (Earth Resources Observation and Science) Center provides remote sensing classroom resources that introduce students to Landsat satellite data and its applications for tracking changes to Earth's surface. These resources demonstrate how satellite imagery collected from 438 miles above Earth captures changes including urban expansion, deforestation, glacial retreat, and agricultural intensification.

In UK educational contexts, satellite imagery accessed through Google Earth, ArcGIS Online, or dedicated remote sensing platforms provides contextual data for field investigations. Students conducting local urban studies can examine their field site within the context of the broader urban area; those investigating coastal processes can relate local erosion observations to coastal management along extended stretches of coastline.

### Integration with Physical Fieldwork

Remote sensing imagery is most pedagogically powerful when integrated with physical fieldwork rather than replacing it. Students can validate satellite observations through ground truthing—comparing what satellites detect with what they observe directly. This comparison develops critical understanding of how geographical data is constructed, including the limitations and uncertainties inherent in remotely sensed information.

The temporal dimension of satellite imagery—repeated coverage over decades—supports change-over-time investigations that would be impossible through fieldwork alone. Students can quantify changes in land use, vegetation cover, or water bodies, then investigate the causes and consequences of these changes through their own field observations and secondary research.

## Drones and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles

Drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) represent an emerging technology for geographical fieldwork, offering low-altitude aerial perspectives that bridge the gap between ground-level observation and satellite imagery. Research by Hodgson and Pavlov (2022) and others has documented the potential of drone-integrated geography education, while systematic reviews of drone-integrated STEM education demonstrate their utility across multiple educational contexts.

### Educational Applications

Drones enable students to collect their own aerial photography and videography of field sites, providing perspectives that would previously have required aircraft or expensive commercial commissioning. The overhead view reveals patterns not visible from ground level—field boundaries, vegetation patterns, coastal geomorphology, and urban layouts become comprehensible in ways that ground-level observation cannot achieve.

For physical geography investigations, drones can generate Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) through photogrammetry, creating 3D representations of terrain that support analysis of slope angles, aspect, and landform characteristics. These capabilities are particularly valuable for geomorphological investigations where terrain characteristics are central to understanding process.

### Regulatory and Safety Considerations

Educational drone use is subject to regulatory frameworks that vary by jurisdiction. In the UK, the Civil Aviation Authority regulates drone operations, with specific requirements for operators and limitations on where drones may be flown. Schools must ensure that drone use complies with these regulations, including maintaining visual line of sight, respecting privacy, and avoiding restricted airspace.

Safety considerations extend beyond regulatory compliance. Risk assessments for drone fieldwork must address potential harm to operators, bystanders, and property. The noise and visual intrusion of drones may disturb wildlife and other fieldwork users, requiring thoughtful planning of when and where drone deployment is appropriate. These considerations make drones suitable for some educational contexts but not all; they represent an extension of fieldwork capabilities rather than a universal replacement for existing approaches.

## Blended Fieldwork Approaches

The most effective contemporary fieldwork typically employs blended approaches that combine physical and digital elements strategically. Digital tools enhance physical fieldwork through data collection, navigation, and analysis, while virtual elements provide access to locations, scales, and temporal dimensions that physical presence alone cannot achieve.

### Pre-Fieldwork Digital Preparation

Before physical fieldwork, digital tools enable site familiarisation, hypothesis formation, and planning. Google Earth exploration allows students to understand the geographical context of their investigation site, identify potential sampling locations, and anticipate challenges. GIS analysis of existing datasets can suggest hypotheses to test or patterns to investigate, giving students purpose and focus when they reach the field location.

Virtual reconnaissance of field sites using Street View, 360-degree photographs, or previous years' student documentation prepares students for what they will encounter, reducing anxiety and enabling more confident engagement with the physical environment. This preparation is particularly valuable for students with autism spectrum conditions or anxiety disorders who benefit from knowing what to expect before novel experiences.

### Digital Enhancement During Fieldwork

During physical fieldwork, mobile devices and dedicated apps support data collection, navigation, and immediate analysis. GPS-enabled data collection ensures precise location recording, while photography with automatic geotagging creates visual documentation linked to specific coordinates. Real-time weather apps inform decisions about data collection timing, and tide tables (for coastal fieldwork) ensure safe and effective fieldwork windows.

Some blended approaches use digital tools to overcome physical limitations. Students with mobility impairments might explore virtual representations of field sites that their peers visit physically, then contribute to collaborative analysis using the same digital platforms. This approach maintains inclusion and shared learning objectives while acknowledging different physical capabilities.

### Post-Fieldwork Digital Analysis

Following physical fieldwork, digital tools enable analysis that extends beyond what is possible in the field. GIS platforms allow sophisticated spatial analysis of collected data, revealing patterns and relationships not apparent during data collection. Statistical software supports rigorous analysis of quantitative data, testing hypotheses and calculating significance.

Digital presentation tools enable students to communicate their findings through interactive maps, data visualisations, and multimedia reports. Story maps combining narrative, maps, photographs, and data visualisations represent a contemporary format for geographical communication that develops digital literacy alongside geographical understanding.

## Pedagogical Considerations and Best Practices

Effective digital fieldwork requires thoughtful pedagogical design that addresses technology integration, skill progression, and the balance between digital and physical engagement.

### Technology Integration Framework

The Geographical Association's guidance on using technology in geography teaching establishes that teachers need competence in handling hardware and key software tools including GIS, databases, and fieldwork applications. Professional development should address both technical skills and pedagogical strategies for integrating digital tools effectively.

Technology should serve geographical learning rather than driving it. The selection of digital tools should be guided by learning objectives—what geographical understanding do we want students to develop, and how can digital tools support that development? This learner-centred approach prevents technology from becoming an end in itself or a distraction from geographical thinking.

### Skill Progression

Digital fieldwork skills should develop progressively across key stages, building complexity and independence over time. At Key Stage 1 and 2, students might use simple digital tools for recording field observations and viewing maps of their local area. Key Stage 3 students should develop capabilities in using GIS for data analysis and creating digital presentations of field findings.

GCSE and A Level students should employ sophisticated digital tools for independent fieldwork investigations, including independent selection of appropriate technologies, critical evaluation of digital data sources, and combination of multiple digital tools to address complex geographical questions. The capacity to select and justify methodological choices, including digital tool selection, represents an important threshold in geographical education.

### Balancing Digital and Physical Engagement

While digital fieldwork offers significant advantages, educators must maintain the distinctive value of physical fieldwork engagement. The embodied experience of being in place—the weather, sounds, smells, and physical effort of moving through landscape—contributes to geographical understanding in ways that digital representation cannot fully replicate.

Best practice involves strategic deployment of digital tools to enhance rather than replace physical engagement. Mobile devices should support observation rather than distract from it; GIS analysis should extend understanding derived from field experience rather than substituting for that experience. The Royal Geographical Society's principles establish that virtual fieldwork supplements and enhances but does not normally substitute for in-situ field learning.

## Accessibility and Inclusion

Digital fieldwork offers significant potential for enhancing accessibility and inclusion in geographical education, though realising this potential requires thoughtful design and implementation.

### Removing Barriers to Participation

Virtual fieldwork removes many barriers that prevent students from participating in physical fieldwork. Financial barriers—costs of transportation, equipment, and residential accommodation—are eliminated when fieldwork can be conducted virtually. Physical barriers affecting students with mobility impairments are circumvented through digital access. Temporal barriers affecting students with caring responsibilities or employment commitments can be addressed through asynchronous virtual fieldwork that students can complete at times that suit their circumstances.

The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that digital fieldwork could maintain curricular continuity when physical fieldwork was impossible. The legacy of this period includes recognition that digital approaches can enhance inclusion beyond emergency circumstances, providing alternative pathways for students who would otherwise be excluded from fieldwork experiences.

### Designing for Accessibility

Effective digital fieldwork requires attention to accessibility principles in design and implementation. Virtual field trips should incorporate alt text for images, transcripts for audio content, and keyboard navigation for students using assistive technologies. Colour contrast and font choices affect readability for students with visual impairments, while clear navigation structures support students with cognitive differences.

The H5P interactive content creation tool incorporates digital accessibility features as standard, including text descriptions and alternative pathways. Platforms such as Google Earth and ArcGIS Online have improved their accessibility features, though educators should verify compatibility with specific assistive technologies used by their students.

### Avoiding Digital Exclusion

While digital fieldwork can enhance inclusion, it also creates risks of digital exclusion for students who lack access to devices, reliable internet connectivity, or digital skills. Schools must ensure that digital fieldwork activities can be completed using school-provided devices and connectivity, and that students receive appropriate scaffolding to develop digital capabilities alongside geographical understanding.

The principle of universal design suggests that digital fieldwork should be designed to be accessible to the widest possible range of students without requiring individual accommodations. This approach benefits all students—captions support comprehension in noisy environments as well as for deaf students; clear navigation supports students with cognitive differences and those unfamiliar with the platform.

## Assessment and Digital Fieldwork

Digital fieldwork raises important considerations for assessment, including authenticity of student work, appropriate assessment of digital skills alongside geographical understanding, and managing the logistical challenges of digital submission.

### Authenticating Student Work

Digital fieldwork can raise concerns about authenticity, as students might theoretically use others' photographs, data, or virtual explorations without conducting their own investigations. Assessment design should address these concerns through strategies such as requiring contemporaneous fieldwork diaries, incorporating data collection timestamps and GPS coordinates, and using viva voce examination to probe understanding of field locations that indicates personal presence.

Virtual field trips present particular challenges for authentication, as students complete identical experiences rather than individual investigations. Assessment should focus on analysis and interpretation rather than mere description, requiring students to demonstrate higher-order thinking that cannot be achieved through superficial engagement.

### Assessing Digital Skills

Digital fieldwork assessment should address both geographical understanding and digital capabilities. Mark criteria might explicitly address the sophistication of GIS analysis, appropriateness of digital tool selection, quality of data visualisation, and effectiveness of digital communication. However, assessment should not penalise students for lacking access to premium software—equivalent capabilities across different platforms should be recognised and rewarded equally.

The GA advocates for assessment that values geographical thinking over technical proficiency. A student who uses basic GIS tools to develop sophisticated geographical insights should be rewarded more highly than one who deploys advanced technical capabilities to produce superficial analysis.

## Future Directions

Digital fieldwork continues to evolve rapidly, with emerging technologies and pedagogical approaches expanding possibilities for geographical education.

### Emerging Technologies

Augmented Reality (AR) applications overlay digital information onto physical environments, potentially enriching fieldwork experiences by highlighting invisible features such as historical landscapes, subsurface geology, or proposed developments. Virtual Reality (VR) headsets provide increasingly immersive virtual field experiences, though cost and accessibility considerations currently limit widespread educational adoption.

Artificial Intelligence applications are beginning to support fieldwork through automated image recognition, enabling apps that identify plant species from photographs or classify land use types. These capabilities may reduce the need for extensive prior knowledge while developing students' abilities to critically evaluate AI-generated classifications.

Citizen science platforms enable students to contribute to genuine research projects through field data collection, connecting classroom fieldwork to real scientific endeavours. Platforms such as iNaturalist for biodiversity recording or Weather Underground for meteorological observations demonstrate how student fieldwork can contribute to broader knowledge generation.

### Sustainability Considerations

The environmental impact of fieldwork, including carbon emissions from transportation to field sites, has prompted interest in digital alternatives that reduce environmental footprints. The Royal Geographical Society's principles for field courses explicitly note that the environmental impact of fieldwork and its carbon footprint should be considered in planning.

Virtual field trips to distant locations offer obvious environmental advantages over air travel for international fieldwork. However, the energy consumption of digital infrastructure should not be ignored—streaming video and cloud computing have their own environmental costs. The most sustainable approach may involve local physical fieldwork supplemented by digital exploration of distant locations, combining the educational benefits of embodied experience with the environmental benefits of reduced travel.

## Conclusion

Digital fieldwork and virtual alternatives have become essential components of contemporary geography education, offering capabilities that complement and extend traditional physical fieldwork. GIS platforms enable sophisticated spatial analysis; virtual field trips provide access to otherwise inaccessible locations; mobile devices democratise data collection; and blended approaches combine the strengths of physical and digital engagement.

Effective digital fieldwork requires thoughtful pedagogical design that positions technology in service of geographical learning rather than as an end in itself. The Royal Geographical Society's principle that virtual fieldwork supplements and enhances but does not normally substitute for in-situ field learning provides important guidance, maintaining the distinctive educational value of embodied experience while recognising the significant contributions of digital approaches.

As digital technologies continue to evolve, geography educators must maintain critical engagement with new tools, evaluating their potential to enhance geographical understanding while remaining alert to accessibility, environmental, and pedagogical considerations. The goal is not to adopt every new technology, but to select and deploy digital tools strategically in ways that develop students' geographical capabilities, digital literacy, and understanding of our complex world.
