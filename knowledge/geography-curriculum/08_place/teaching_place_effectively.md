# Teaching Place Effectively in Geography

## Introduction: Why Place Matters

Place is one of geography's most fundamental yet complex concepts. Unlike the abstract spatial analysis favoured by quantitative geographers in the mid-twentieth century, contemporary geography education recognises place as the lived, meaningful setting of human activity—where the "where" becomes "what is it like there?" and "how do people experience it?" Teaching place effectively requires moving beyond superficial coverage of locations towards deep, critical engagement with how places are constructed, experienced, and contested.

The Geographical Association (GA) identifies place knowledge as one of the three core forms of geographical knowledge, alongside geographical concepts and procedural knowledge. However, Ofsted's 2023 geography subject report found that place teaching remains a persistent weakness in many schools, often reduced to "locational knowledge quizzes" or shallow "country projects" that reinforce stereotypes rather than developing genuine geographical understanding. This knowledge file explores how teachers can avoid these pitfalls through careful attention to avoiding single stories, balancing depth and breadth, and understanding place as dynamic and contested.

## Avoiding Single Stories: The Dangers of Oversimplification

### Understanding the Single Story Concept

The term "single story" originates from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's influential TED talk (2009), which describes how reducing complex human realities to one narrative creates misunderstanding and prejudice. In geography education, single stories manifest when places are presented through limited, often stereotypical lenses: Africa as uniformly poor and conflict-ridden; the Middle East as inherently unstable; or rural England as unchanging and nostalgic.

Dr Eleanor Rawling, former President of the Geographical Association, argues that single stories in geography are particularly damaging because they appear authoritative—presented as factual knowledge when they are actually selective interpretations. When pupils learn that "Africa suffers from drought" or "the Amazon is being destroyed," they absorb not only incomplete information but also implicit value judgements about causation and responsibility.

### Common Single Stories in Geography Teaching

**Development Geography** remains particularly prone to single stories. The traditional "development continuum" from LIC to HIC (Low-Income Country to High-Income Country) presents a linear model that ignores diverse development pathways, internal inequalities, and the historical processes that created global disparities. The persistent use of case studies focusing only on extreme poverty or humanitarian crises—Ethiopian famine, Haitian earthquake, Syrian refugees—creates what Dr Nicola Sheldon calls "poverty tourism" in the geography classroom.

**Environmental Narratives** also perpetuate simplifications. The Amazon rainforest is invariably presented through the lens of deforestation and biodiversity loss, rarely through the perspectives of Indigenous communities managing forests sustainably for millennia or the complex political economies driving land-use change. Similarly, climate change impacts are often localised to polar bears and Pacific islands, obscuring the interconnected responsibilities and vulnerabilities that characterise the climate crisis.

**Urban Studies** frequently reproduce dichotomies between "developed" and "developing" cities. While London's challenges might be framed around transport infrastructure and housing density, Lagos's equivalent challenges become framed through narratives of chaos, informality, and deficiency. This asymmetry prevents pupils from recognising shared urban processes and mutual learning opportunities between cities globally.

### Strategies for Disrupting Single Stories

**Multiple Representations**: Effective place teaching deliberately seeks diverse sources and perspectives. Rather than relying solely on textbooks or news media, teachers should incorporate:
- Literary sources from authors native to the region
- Documentary films by local filmmakers
- Social media and blogs by young people living in the place
- Academic research by geographers from the region
- Diaspora community voices within the UK

The Geographical Association's "Worldwise" materials exemplify this approach, presenting places through multiple lenses rather than authoritative single narratives.

**Complicating Questions**: Teachers should habitually ask questions that disrupt easy assumptions:
- "Who benefits from this representation of this place?"
- "What is missing from this account?"
- "How might someone living there describe their home differently?"
- "What other stories could we tell about this place?"

These questions model critical geographical thinking and encourage pupils to approach all geographical information with appropriate scepticism.

**Counter-Examples and Complexity**: When teaching about drought in East Africa, for instance, effective teachers also discuss successful water management initiatives, technological innovation, and the region's economic dynamism. The goal is not to replace negative stories with positive ones—that would merely create different single stories—but to present places in their full complexity.

**Temporal Depth**: Single stories often result from presenting places as static snapshots. By examining how places change over time, teachers can reveal dynamism, agency, and complexity. A lesson on contemporary Lagos might begin with its history as a Yoruba fishing village, through its colonial significance, independence-era growth, and current status as Africa's largest city—revealing multiple Lagos-es rather than one.

## Depth Versus Breadth: The Case Study Dilemma

### The Breadth Problem

Traditional geography curricula often prioritised breadth of coverage—a "world tour" approach touching lightly on many places. Pupils might "visit" Brazil, India, Kenya, and China in a single term, accumulating fragmented, decontextualised facts about each. Research by Professor Michael Young suggests this approach produces "inert knowledge" that pupils cannot apply or transfer; they can name facts but not explain processes or relationships.

The 2014 National Curriculum's emphasis on "core knowledge" was partly a reaction against this breadth-heavy approach. However, without careful implementation, it risks replacing one problem with another: drilling locational facts without developing meaningful place understanding.

### The Depth Imperative

Contemporary geographical pedagogy emphasises depth over breadth—studying fewer places but examining them thoroughly through multiple geographical lenses. The rationale draws on educational research showing that deep, elaborated knowledge is more durable and transferable than superficial coverage.

**Immersion Approaches**: Some schools adopt "regional immersion" models, where pupils study one region in considerable depth across multiple lessons. For example, rather than three lessons on "Africa" (a continent of 54 countries and 1.4 billion people), pupils might spend six weeks exploring Nigeria through economic, social, political, and environmental geography—developing genuine understanding of the interconnections between these dimensions.

**Case Study Quality**: When using case studies, teachers should prioritise:
- Complexity: Does the case reveal geographical processes in action rather than illustrating predetermined conclusions?
- Recency: Does the case reflect contemporary realities rather than outdated stereotypes?
- Scale appropriateness: Is the case at a scale where pupils can comprehend both local specificity and wider connections?
- Diversity: Do case studies collectively represent the diversity of human experience rather than repeatedly centring the same perspectives?

### The Regional Studies Revival

Regional geography—once dismissed as descriptive and theoretically naïve—has experienced a revival in educational contexts. Contemporary regional studies draw on the "new regional geography" that emerged in the 1980s, which treats regions not as given natural entities but as socially constructed, politically contested, and historically contingent.

**Characteristics of Effective Regional Studies**:

1. **Process over Description**: Rather than cataloguing regional characteristics (climate, population, economy), effective regional studies examine processes: How has this region been shaped by colonialism and post-colonial development? How do globalisation processes interact with local specificities? How do different groups within the region experience and contest its development?

2. **Internal Differentiation**: Regions are not uniform. Effective teaching reveals internal diversity—between urban and rural areas, between coastal and interior zones, between different social groups. Teaching "the North of England" requires acknowledging differences between Liverpool, Leeds, Newcastle, and rural Northumberland; between prosperous suburbs and post-industrial towns.

3. **Regional Interconnections**: Places do not exist in isolation. Effective regional studies trace connections to other places: migration flows, economic linkages, cultural exchange, environmental interdependence. A study of the Caribbean, for instance, must encompass historical connections to Africa (via the slave trade), Europe (via colonialism), and contemporary diaspora communities in British cities.

4. **Regional Identity and Representation**: How is the region represented, and by whom? Who claims regional identity, and who is excluded from such claims? These questions lead pupils into sophisticated geographical thinking about the politics of place.

### Balancing Depth and Breadth: Practical Approaches

Teachers need not choose entirely between depth and breadth but can design curricula that balance both:

**Anchor Cases and Comparative Contexts**: Pupils might study two or three places in depth (anchor cases) while making passing reference to other contexts for comparison. For example, detailed study of Nigeria and Brazil might provide the analytical framework for briefer examination of other emerging economies.

**Spiral Curriculum**: Place knowledge can be revisited at increasing depth across key stages. KS2 might provide broad orientation ("I know where Brazil is and some basic facts"); KS3 adds analytical depth ("I can explain Brazil's regional inequalities"); KS4 develops evaluative capacity ("I can assess different interpretations of Brazil's development challenges").

**Thematic Through-Lines**: Rather than organising curriculum by place, teachers might organise by theme while drawing on diverse places for illustration. A unit on "urban challenges" might reference Mumbai, Lagos, London, and São Paulo at different points, with pupils developing understanding of common urban processes while appreciating contextual differences.

## Place as Dynamic and Contested

### Theoretical Foundations

Contemporary geographical theory understands place not as a fixed container of activities but as continually produced through social relations. Doreen Massey's concept of a "global sense of place" (1993) is particularly influential in geography education: places are nodes in networks of social relations stretching across space, constantly changing as those relations change.

This theoretical grounding has practical implications for teaching:
- **Places are not static**: They change continuously in response to local, national, and global processes
- **Places are not bounded**: They extend beyond their apparent boundaries through connections to elsewhere
- **Places are not singular**: Different groups experience and understand the same place differently
- **Places are politically contested**: Questions about what a place is, who it belongs to, and how it should develop are matters of power and conflict

### Teaching Place as Dynamic

**Historical Geographies**: Effective place teaching incorporates historical depth, showing how places have changed and are changing. This might involve:
- Comparing historical maps with contemporary ones
- Examining oral histories and archival materials
- Analysing historical photographs and their contemporary equivalents
- Studying planned developments and their projected impacts

The Historical Association and Geographical Association have collaborated on materials showing how historical and geographical thinking together illuminate place change.

**Contemporary Process Analysis**: Rather than teaching places as finished products, teachers should emphasise ongoing processes: urbanisation, deindustrialisation, migration, technological change, environmental transformation. These processes can be illustrated through specific places while recognising that the same processes operate (differently) across multiple contexts.

**Future Geographies**: Speculative engagement with possible futures helps pupils understand places as dynamic. What might this place be like in 2050? What decisions being made now will shape that future? Who will benefit and lose from different development pathways?

### Teaching Place as Contested

**Multiple Perspectives**: Places are experienced differently by different people. A city centre might be experienced as exciting by young professionals, threatening by elderly residents, profitable by business owners, and exclusionary by homeless people. Teaching place effectively incorporates this multiplicity rather than presenting one "official" version.

**Conflict and Power**: Geography curricula often sanitise place by ignoring conflict. Effective teaching acknowledges tensions:
- Gentrification processes displacing established communities
- Environmental conflicts over land use and resource access
- Political struggles over regional autonomy and identity
- Economic contests between global and local interests

These are not "difficult topics" to avoid but central geographical realities that illuminate how places are made and remade through power relations.

**Pupil Agency**: Understanding place as contested opens space for pupil agency. If places are made through human decisions, they can be remade through different decisions. This realisation transforms geography from a passive body of knowledge into an active, potentially transformative understanding.

### Critical Pedagogy of Place

The most sophisticated place teaching draws on critical pedagogy, recognising that:
- Knowledge about places is not neutral but reflects particular interests and perspectives
- Pupils bring their own place knowledge and experiences that should be valued
- Geography education can contribute to—or challenge—social inequalities
- Understanding place processes empowers pupils to engage critically with their own environments

Professor David Lambert, former Chief Executive of the Geographical Association, argues for "curriculum making" in which teachers and pupils together construct place knowledge that is meaningful, relevant, and potentially transformative.

## Practical Pedagogies for Teaching Place

### Enquiry-Based Approaches

Enquiry-based learning is particularly suited to place study because it mirrors how geographers actually work: formulating questions, gathering evidence, analysing data, and reaching conclusions. A place enquiry might follow this structure:

1. **Hook and Question**: An intriguing image, object, or story raises questions about a place
2. **Initial Investigation**: Pupils gather basic information and map their existing knowledge
3. **Deepening Enquiry**: Structured investigation using diverse sources and methods
4. **Critical Reflection**: Examining the limitations of sources, considering alternative perspectives
5. **Synthesis and Presentation**: Communicating findings in ways that respect the place's complexity

The Geographical Association's "Young Geographers" project provides numerous examples of effective place enquiries.

### Fieldwork and First-Hand Experience

While not all places can be visited directly, fieldwork principles apply to place study generally:
- **Systematic observation**: Structured noticing using frameworks and recording methods
- **Qualitative methods**: Interviews, photographs, field sketches capturing experiential dimensions
- **Secondary data integration**: Combining first-hand observation with maps, statistics, and other sources
- **Reflection on positionality**: Acknowledging how the observer's perspective shapes what they see

Virtual fieldwork using immersive technologies, Google Earth, and rich multimedia resources can partially substitute for physical visits while developing similar observational and analytical skills.

### Creative and Expressive Approaches

Place is not only analytical but also affective—places evoke feelings, memories, and creative responses. Effective pedagogy incorporates:
- **Place writing**: Creative non-fiction, poetry, and descriptive prose exploring place experience
- **Artistic representation**: Photography, sketching, and mapping as ways of seeing places
- **Sensory engagement**: Soundscapes, smellscapes, and embodied experience of place
- **Narrative approaches**: Storytelling as a way of understanding place meanings

These approaches complement analytical geography by engaging pupils' emotional and creative intelligence.

### Technology and Place

Digital technologies offer powerful tools for place teaching:
- **GIS and digital mapping**: Revealing spatial patterns and relationships
- **Virtual reality**: Immersive experiences of distant places
- **Social media analysis**: Understanding how places are represented and experienced by inhabitants
- **Data visualisation**: Communicating complex place information effectively

However, technology should serve geographical purposes rather than drive them. The question is always: how does this tool help pupils understand place more deeply?

## Assessment and Place Knowledge

### What to Assess

Assessment of place knowledge should focus on:
- **Understanding** rather than mere recall: Can pupils explain geographical processes, not just name facts?
- **Application**: Can pupils apply their place knowledge to new contexts and questions?
- **Critical evaluation**: Can pupils assess the reliability and representativeness of place information?
- **Interconnection**: Can pupils make connections between different aspects of place and between places?

### Assessment Methods

**Extended Writing**: Essays and reports allowing pupils to demonstrate depth of understanding and critical thinking about places.

**Source Analysis**: Evaluating diverse sources (maps, images, accounts, data) about places to assess analytical and evaluative skills.

**Enquiry Outputs**: Products of sustained place enquiries that demonstrate research, synthesis, and communication skills.

**Comparative Analysis**: Assessing understanding by asking pupils to compare places or examine a place through multiple lenses.

### Avoiding Assessment Pitfalls

**Trivial Pursuit Tests**: Multiple-choice or short-answer questions testing recall of isolated facts encourage superficial, breadth-heavy teaching and tell us little about genuine geographical understanding.

**Reproduction of Single Stories**: Assessment that rewards stereotypical or simplified accounts of places reinforces the very problems this knowledge file addresses.

**Inaccessible Assumptions**: Assessment should not assume pupils have background knowledge derived from particular cultural experiences. Not all pupils have visited London, let alone abroad.

## Implications for Curriculum Design

### Sequencing Place Knowledge

Effective curricula sequence place study deliberately:
- **Local to global**: Beginning with places pupils know personally, expanding outward
- **Familiar to unfamiliar**: Building from accessible contexts to more distant ones
- **Concrete to abstract**: Starting with tangible place experiences before theoretical analysis
- **Contemporary to historical**: Engaging with present-day places before examining historical change

These progressions are not rigid rules but useful heuristics for curriculum planning.

### Representation and Diversity

Curriculum designers should audit their place coverage:
- **Geographic range**: Do selected places represent diverse global contexts?
- **Scale diversity**: Is there appropriate balance between local, national, regional, and global scales?
- **Perspective diversity**: Do chosen cases allow exposure to multiple viewpoints and experiences?
- **Challenge to stereotypes**: Does the curriculum actively disrupt common single stories?

The goal is not tokenistic inclusion but genuine engagement with geographical diversity.

### Integration with Other Geographical Knowledge

Place should not be taught in isolation but integrated with:
- **Geographical concepts**: Using places to exemplify and explore concepts like space, scale, interdependence, sustainability
- **Geographical skills**: Developing mapwork, data analysis, and fieldwork through place study
- **Contemporary issues**: Connecting place knowledge to pressing global challenges

This integration produces coherent, meaningful geography rather than fragmented factual coverage.

## Conclusion: Towards Transformative Place Education

Teaching place effectively is among geography education's most important and challenging tasks. It requires moving beyond superficial coverage towards deep, critical, affective engagement with how places are made, experienced, and contested. It demands that teachers themselves examine their assumptions, seek diverse perspectives, and acknowledge the limitations of any single representation.

When done well, place education develops pupils who:
- Understand the complexity and diversity of the world and its peoples
- Approach geographical information critically, recognising multiple perspectives and contested meanings
- Appreciate how places are interconnected across scales from local to global
- Recognise their own positionality and how it shapes their understanding of places
- Feel empowered to engage actively with the places they inhabit and the global processes shaping them

Such education is not merely academic preparation but contributes to the formation of informed, critical, and compassionate global citizens—surely one of geography's most valuable contributions to the curriculum and to society.
