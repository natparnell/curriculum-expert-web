# A Level Geography: Subject Criteria and Independent Investigation

## Overview

A Level Geography represents the culmination of geographical education in secondary schools, offering students the opportunity to engage with complex interactions between physical and human systems at local, national, and global scales. The qualification was reformed in 2016, with first teaching beginning in September 2016 and first assessment in summer 2018. The reformed A Level aims to provide a coherent and balanced understanding of geography, whilst maintaining academic rigour and developing students' independent research capabilities through the non-examined assessment (NEA).

The qualification serves multiple purposes: it prepares students for higher education in geography and related disciplines; develops transferable skills valued by employers; and fosters informed citizenship through deep engagement with contemporary global challenges including climate change, urbanisation, globalisation, and sustainable development. All A Level Geography specifications must comply with the Department for Education (DfE) subject content published in December 2014, which defines the mandatory content, assessment objectives, and fieldwork requirements.

## DfE Subject Content Requirements

### Statutory Framework

The DfE's GCE AS and A Level subject content for geography (December 2014) establishes the foundation upon which all awarding organisations must build their specifications. This document specifies that A Level Geography specifications must:

- Develop students' knowledge and understanding of geographical concepts and appreciate the relevance of these concepts to our changing world
- Develop students' knowledge and understanding of geographical ideas and apply them to contemporary contexts
- Develop students' understanding of the complexity of interactions and interrelationships between people and their environments over space and time
- Develop students' understanding of geographical enquiry and develop as reflective and independent learners and critical and creative thinkers
- Develop students' understanding of fieldwork techniques and geographical skills, including appropriate technologies, and demonstrate knowledge and understanding of places and environments at a range of scales

### Core Content Areas

The DfE subject content mandates coverage of both physical and human geography at A Level, with specifications required to include:

**Physical Geography**

All specifications must address water and carbon cycles, and coastal systems and landscapes. Additionally, specifications must cover two further topics from: glaciers and glaciated landscapes; hot desert environments and their margins; ecosystems under stress; or hazards.

**Human Geography**

All specifications must address global systems and global governance, and changing places. Additionally, specifications must cover two further topics from: contemporary urban environments; population and the environment; or resource security.

This structure ensures that all students develop comprehensive knowledge across the breadth of the discipline, whilst allowing some flexibility for specifications to differentiate themselves through optional topics.

### Geographical Skills Requirements

The DfE mandates that A Level specifications must require students to demonstrate competence in a range of geographical skills, including:

- Cartographic skills (using and interpreting Ordnance Survey maps, sketch maps, GIS)
- Graphical skills (using and interpreting various graphical forms, including those associated with fieldwork)
- Statistical skills (understanding measures of central tendency, dispersion, correlation, and significance testing)
- Fieldwork skills (designing, conducting, and evaluating fieldwork investigations)

These skills are assessed both through examination papers and the independent investigation, ensuring that students develop practical geographical competencies alongside conceptual understanding.

## Exam Board Specifications

### AQA A Level Geography (7037)

AQA's specification is the most widely adopted A Level Geography programme in England, offering a comprehensive approach to the discipline that balances physical and human geography whilst emphasising the interconnectedness of geographical systems.

**Specification Structure**

The AQA specification comprises four components:

| Component | Content | Assessment | Weighting |
|-----------|---------|------------|-----------|
| Physical Geography | Water and carbon cycles; coastal systems; one optional topic | Written exam (2h 30m) | 40% |
| Human Geography | Global systems and governance; changing places; one optional topic | Written exam (2h 30m) | 40% |
| Geography Fieldwork Investigation | Independent investigation based on fieldwork | Non-examined assessment | 20% |
| Geographical Skills | Integrated across all components | Assessed throughout | - |

**Fieldwork Requirements**

AQA requires students to undertake four days of fieldwork during their A Level course. This must include at least two days in an unfamiliar environment, encouraging students to apply their geographical understanding in diverse contexts. The fieldwork days must relate to both physical and human geography, ensuring balanced coverage of the discipline.

The specification emphasises that fieldwork should not be seen merely as data collection for the NEA but as integral to geographical education, developing students' understanding of research design, data collection methods, and the challenges of working in real-world environments.

**Independent Investigation**

The AQA NEA requires students to:
- Define a question or issue for investigation, related to any aspect of the specification content
- Design, conduct, and report on an independent investigation involving fieldwork
- Produce a written report of 3,000-4,000 words
- Demonstrate understanding of the enquiry process, from initial question through to evaluation

The investigation must include data collected in the field by the individual student, though supplementary secondary data may also be used. The specification encourages investigations that connect to students' own geographical interests and that demonstrate genuine independent enquiry.

### Edexcel A Level Geography

Pearson Edexcel's specification offers a structured approach to A Level Geography, with clear progression from foundational concepts to advanced application. The specification places particular emphasis on synoptic assessment and the integration of knowledge across different geographical themes.

**Specification Structure**

The Edexcel specification comprises four components:

| Component | Content | Assessment | Weighting |
|-----------|---------|------------|-----------|
| Topic 1-4 | Tectonic processes; coastal landscapes; globalisation; regeneration | Written exam (2h 15m) | 30% |
| Topic 5-8 | Water cycle; carbon cycle; superpowers; migration/identity | Written exam (2h 15m) | 30% |
| Synoptic Paper | Synoptic investigation of a geographical issue | Written exam (2h 15m) | 20% |
| Independent Investigation | Individual fieldwork investigation | Non-examined assessment | 20% |

**Fieldwork Requirements**

Edexcel requires a minimum of four days of fieldwork, with specifications for what must be covered during these days. The fieldwork must relate to both physical and human geography topics within the specification, and students must develop competence in range of fieldwork techniques including:

- Qualitative and quantitative methods
- Primary and secondary data collection
- Data presentation and analysis techniques
- Evaluation of methods and findings

The specification emphasises that fieldwork should develop students' understanding of the research process, from initial design through to the communication of findings.

**Independent Investigation**

Edexcel's approach to the independent investigation shares the fundamental requirements of other specifications but places particular emphasis on the investigation as a means of developing students' capabilities as independent researchers. Key features include:

- A 3,000-4,000 word written report
- Fieldwork data collected individually by the student
- Clear articulation of the geographical enquiry process
- Critical evaluation of both methods and findings
- Connection to relevant geographical theory and concepts

The specification encourages investigations that demonstrate genuine independence, with students developing their own research questions and adapting established methods to their specific context.

### OCR A Level Geography (H481)

OCR's specification offers a distinctive approach to A Level Geography, with a clear structure that supports progression from foundational knowledge to advanced independent research. The specification is notable for its explicit focus on geographical debates and the contested nature of geographical knowledge.

**Specification Structure**

The OCR A Level comprises four components:

| Component | Content | Assessment | Weighting |
|-----------|---------|------------|-----------|
| Physical Systems | Landscape systems; Earth's life support systems | Written exam (1h 30m) | 24% |
| Human Interactions | Changing spaces, making places; global connections | Written exam (1h 30m) | 24% |
| Geographical Debates | Two topics from a choice of geographical debates | Written exam (2h 30m) | 32% |
| Investigative Geography | Independent investigation | Non-examined assessment | 20% |

**Fieldwork Requirements**

OCR requires students to undertake fieldwork as an integral part of their A Level studies, with four days of fieldwork experience that must include:

- At least one day of physical geography fieldwork
- At least one day of human geography fieldwork
- Opportunities to develop understanding of various fieldwork techniques
- Experience of designing and refining fieldwork enquiries

The specification emphasises that fieldwork should develop students' understanding of the research process and prepare them for the demands of the independent investigation.

**Independent Investigation**

OCR's independent investigation (Component 04/05) requires students to:

- Develop a question or issue for investigation that connects to any aspect of the specification
- Design and conduct fieldwork to collect primary data
- Analyse and interpret data using appropriate geographical skills
- Produce a 3,000-4,000 word written report
- Evaluate their investigation and suggest improvements

The specification places particular emphasis on the investigation as a means of developing students' capabilities as independent researchers, capable of designing and conducting geographical enquiries with minimal direction.

## The Independent Investigation (NEA)

### Purpose and Rationale

The non-examined assessment (NEA) represents a distinctive feature of reformed A Level Geography, accounting for 20% of the total qualification mark. The introduction of the NEA in 2016 reflected a recognition that examination alone cannot adequately assess students' capabilities in designing and conducting independent geographical research.

The NEA serves multiple educational purposes:

1. **Developing Research Capabilities**: The investigation provides an extended opportunity for students to engage with the full research process, from initial question formulation through to the communication of findings. This develops capabilities that are essential for higher education and valuable in many careers.

2. **Demonstrating Integration**: The investigation requires students to draw together knowledge and skills from across the specification, demonstrating their capacity to apply geographical understanding in an independent context.

3. **Fostering Engagement**: By allowing students to investigate topics of personal interest within the broad framework of the specification, the NEA can increase motivation and engagement with the subject.

4. **Preparing for Higher Education**: The NEA provides experience of the kind of independent research that is central to university-level geography, helping students make informed decisions about their future education and preparing them for the demands of degree-level study.

### Assessment Objectives

The NEA is assessed against the same assessment objectives as examination components, but with particular emphasis on AO3 (Application of knowledge and understanding to unfamiliar contexts) and AO4 (Analysis and evaluation). The four assessment objectives are:

**AO1: Demonstrate Knowledge and Understanding**

Students must demonstrate knowledge and understanding of places, environments, concepts, processes, interactions, and change at a variety of scales. In the NEA, this involves connecting the investigation to relevant geographical theory and concepts.

**AO2: Apply Knowledge and Understanding**

Students must apply knowledge and understanding in different contexts to interpret, analyse, and evaluate geographical information and issues. The NEA requires students to apply their understanding to their specific investigation context.

**AO3: Use a Variety of Relevant Quantitative, Qualitative, and Fieldwork Skills**

Students must use a variety of relevant quantitative, qualitative, and fieldwork skills to investigate geographical questions and issues, interpret, analyse, and evaluate data and evidence, and construct arguments and draw conclusions. The NEA provides extensive opportunity for students to demonstrate these skills.

**AO4: Demonstrate Geographical Knowledge and Understanding**

Students must demonstrate geographical knowledge and understanding by making links between different geographical themes and by developing extended written arguments. The NEA requires sustained, coherent written communication of complex geographical arguments.

### The Enquiry Process

The NEA requires students to engage with a structured enquiry process that mirrors the approaches used by professional geographers:

**1. Question and Issue Definition**

Students must define a question or issue for investigation that:
- Is capable of being investigated through fieldwork
- Connects to appropriate geographical theory and concepts
- Is appropriately scaled for a 3,000-4,000 word investigation
- Demonstrates genuine intellectual engagement with geographical questions

Effective questions typically focus on the relationship between variables (e.g., "How does coastal morphology vary along the stretch of coastline?"), explanations of geographical patterns (e.g., "To what extent does urban regeneration create social and economic benefits for local communities?"), or evaluations of geographical theories in specific contexts (e.g., "How effectively does the bid-rent theory explain land use patterns in [specific location]?").

**2. Research Design**

Students must design their investigation to effectively address their research question. This involves:
- Selecting appropriate methods for data collection
- Justifying the choice of methods with reference to geographical theory
- Planning for the practical and ethical challenges of fieldwork
- Considering sampling strategies and the representativeness of data

The research design should demonstrate understanding of the relationship between research questions and methods, and should be justified with reference to established geographical research.

**3. Data Collection**

The NEA requires the collection of primary data through fieldwork, though secondary data may supplement this. Data collection must:
- Be conducted individually by the student
- Be sufficient in quantity and quality to support meaningful analysis
- Demonstrate appropriate techniques for the research question
- Be conducted ethically and safely

Common fieldwork techniques include:

*Physical Geography Investigations*: Environmental quality surveys, sediment analysis, vegetation transects, coastal profiling, river discharge measurements, weather and climate monitoring, land use mapping.

*Human Geography Investigations*: Questionnaires, interviews, observation schedules, land use surveys, environmental quality indices, graffiti/vandalism surveys, pedestrian and traffic counts, building quality surveys.

**4. Data Presentation and Analysis**

Students must present and analyse their data using appropriate geographical skills. This includes:
- Selecting appropriate graphical forms for different types of data
- Using statistical techniques to identify patterns and relationships
- Applying GIS and spatial analysis where appropriate
- Ensuring that analysis directly addresses the research question

The analysis should go beyond simple description to identify patterns, relationships, and anomalies, and should connect findings to relevant geographical theory.

**5. Conclusions and Evaluation**

The investigation must draw conclusions that directly address the research question, supported by evidence from the data analysis. Students must also evaluate:
- The reliability and validity of their findings
- The limitations of their methods and data
- The extent to which their conclusions can be generalised
- Possible improvements to the investigation

Effective evaluation demonstrates critical reflection on the research process and an understanding of the nature of geographical knowledge.

### Managing the NEA Process

**Timeline and Organisation**

The NEA is typically conducted during the summer term of Year 12 and the autumn term of Year 13, though centres have flexibility in their scheduling. A typical timeline might include:

- **Spring Term Year 12**: Introduction to the NEA; exploration of possible topics; initial question development
- **Summer Term Year 12**: Fieldwork data collection; initial data presentation and analysis
- **Summer Holiday Year 12**: Continued analysis and initial drafting
- **Autumn Term Year 13**: Completion of written report; submission for internal assessment

**Teacher Support and Independence**

Centres must ensure that the investigation represents the student's own independent work, whilst providing appropriate support and guidance. Awarding organisations provide detailed guidance on the nature and extent of permissible support, which typically includes:

- General guidance on the nature of the NEA and assessment requirements
- Discussion of possible research questions and their feasibility
- Teaching of fieldwork techniques and research skills
- Feedback on one draft of the investigation (with restrictions on the nature of that feedback)
- Guidance on health and safety and ethical considerations

Teachers must not:
- Provide specific research questions or hypotheses
- Direct students to specific conclusions or interpretations
- Make substantial corrections to drafts
- Provide templates or structures that limit student independence

**Assessment and Moderation**

The NEA is internally assessed by teachers and externally moderated by the awarding organisation. Teachers apply detailed assessment criteria that address:

- The quality of the research question and its geographical grounding
- The appropriateness and justification of research methods
- The effectiveness of data presentation and analysis
- The quality of conclusions and their connection to the evidence
- The critical evaluation of the investigation
- The use of geographical terminology and the quality of written communication

Centres submit marks to the awarding organisation, along with a sample of student work for moderation. The moderation process ensures consistency of assessment standards across centres.

## Fieldwork Requirements and Pedagogy

### Statutory Fieldwork Requirements

The DfE subject content mandates that all A Level Geography students must undertake fieldwork as part of their course. The specific requirements are:

- A minimum of four days of fieldwork during the A Level course
- Fieldwork must address both physical and human geography
- At least two days must be in an unfamiliar environment (AQA specification)
- Fieldwork must be assessed through the NEA

These requirements represent a significant increase from previous specifications and reflect the importance attached to fieldwork in developing students' geographical understanding and research capabilities.

### The Pedagogical Value of Fieldwork

Ofsted's Geography Research Review (2021) emphasised that fieldwork is essential to geographical education, not merely an optional enrichment activity. The review identified that effective fieldwork:

- Develops students' understanding of the complexity and interconnectedness of geographical processes
- Provides opportunities to apply classroom learning in real-world contexts
- Develops practical skills in data collection, analysis, and presentation
- Fosters a sense of place and connection to the environment
- Develops collaborative and independent working capabilities

However, the review also noted significant variation in the quality of fieldwork provision, with some schools treating fieldwork as merely "going outside" without clear educational purposes or adequate preparation and follow-up.

### Planning Effective Fieldwork

Effective fieldwork at A Level requires careful planning that addresses educational purposes, practical logistics, and safety considerations:

**Pre-Fieldwork Preparation**

Students should arrive at fieldwork locations with:
- Clear understanding of the purposes of the fieldwork
- Knowledge of the theoretical context for their investigations
- Competence in the techniques they
