# EYFS Geography: Understanding the World

## Overview

Geography in the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) sits within the **Understanding the World** area of learning. Rather than being taught as a discrete subject, geographical learning emerges through children's exploration of their immediate environment, their community, and the natural world around them.

The EYFS Statutory Framework (2021) defines Understanding the World as:

> "Understanding the World involves guiding children to make sense of their physical world and their community. The frequency and range of children's personal experiences increases their knowledge and sense of the world around them – from visiting parks, libraries and museums to meeting important members of society such as police officers, nurses and firefighters."

The framework emphasises that enriching and widening children's vocabulary supports later reading comprehension across all domains, including geography.

## Where Geography Lives in EYFS

### Two Key Early Learning Goals (ELGs)

The 2021 EYFS Statutory Framework specifies two ELGs with direct geographical content:

#### 1. ELG: People, Culture and Communities

Children at the **expected level of development** will:

- **Describe their immediate environment** using knowledge from observation, discussion, stories, non-fiction texts and maps
- **Know some similarities and differences** between different religious and cultural communities in this country, drawing on their experiences and what has been read in class
- **Explain some similarities and differences** between life in this country and life in other countries, drawing on knowledge from stories, non-fiction texts and – when appropriate – maps

#### 2. ELG: The Natural World

Children at the **expected level of development** will:

- **Explore the natural world around them**, making observations and drawing pictures of animals and plants
- **Know some similarities and differences** between the natural world around them and contrasting environments, drawing on their experiences and what has been read in class
- **Understand some important processes and changes** in the natural world around them, including the seasons and changing states of matter

## Development Matters 2021: Geography Strand

The non-statutory *Development Matters* guidance (DfE, 2021) provides a developmental progression for Understanding the World across three age bands:

### Birth to Three: Building Foundations

While not explicitly geographical, early experiences establish crucial foundations:
- Exploring the environment through sensory play
- Developing spatial awareness through movement and navigation
- Building vocabulary about places, positions, and features

### 3 and 4 Year Olds: Emerging Geographical Thinking

Children in this age band are learning to:

- **Talk about what they see**, using a wide vocabulary (developing descriptive language essential for place description)
- **Know that there are different countries in the world** and talk about the differences they have experienced or seen in photos
- **Plant seeds** and understand how to keep them healthy (beginnings of understanding natural processes)
- **Explore and talk about** different forces they can feel (early physical geography concepts)
- **Talk about the differences between materials** and how they can change (foundations for understanding physical processes)

### Children in Reception: Developing Geographers

Children in Reception will be learning to:

- **Describe their immediate environment** using knowledge from observation, discussion, stories, non-fiction texts and maps
- **Know some similarities and differences between different religious and cultural communities** in this country, drawing on their experiences and what has been read in class
- **Explain some similarities and differences between life in this country and life in other countries**, drawing on knowledge from stories, non-fiction texts and – when appropriate – maps
- **Explore the natural world around them**, making observations and drawing pictures of animals and plants
- **Know some similarities and differences between the natural world around them and contrasting environments**, drawing on their experiences and what has been read in class
- **Understand some important processes and changes in the natural world around them**, including the seasons and changing states of matter

## How Geographical Thinking Begins in Reception

### From Experience to Concept

Geographical thinking in Reception emerges from **first-hand experiences**. Children:

1. **Explore their immediate environment** – the classroom, school grounds, and local area
2. **Notice similarities and differences** between places they know and places they learn about
3. **Use simple maps** – interpreting pictorial maps, creating their own maps of familiar spaces
4. **Engage with stories and non-fiction** about different places and cultures
5. **Observe natural phenomena** – weather, seasons, plant growth, animal habitats

### The Role of Play

Play is central to early geographical learning:

- **Small world play** develops understanding of spatial relationships and representation
- **Construction play** involves planning, positioning, and understanding how spaces work
- **Outdoor play** provides direct experience of natural features and physical processes
- **Role play** (shops, post office, travel agents) introduces concepts of community and economic activity

### Vocabulary Development

The EYFS framework emphasises that enriching vocabulary supports later reading comprehension. Key geographical vocabulary for Reception includes:

| Category | Example Vocabulary |
|----------|-------------------|
| Place features | hill, valley, river, road, building, park |
| Position/direction | near, far, next to, beside, above, below, through |
| Weather/climate | sunny, rainy, windy, hot, cold, freezing, melting |
| Materials | soil, sand, rock, water, ice, wood, metal |
| Human features | house, shop, school, road, bridge, farm |
| Physical features | tree, flower, mountain, sea, beach, forest |

---

## Progression into Key Stage 1

The EYFS provides essential foundations for the Key Stage 1 National Curriculum:

| EYFS Foundation | KS1 Development |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Describing immediate environment | Locational knowledge: name and locate the world's seven continents and five oceans |
| Using simple maps | Using maps, atlases and globes; using simple compass directions |
| Observing weather and seasons | Identify seasonal and daily weather patterns in the UK and location of hot and cold areas |
| Comparing environments | Understanding geographical similarities and differences through studying the human and physical geography of a small area of the UK and a small area in a contrasting non-European country |
| Fieldwork in school grounds | Use simple fieldwork and observational skills to study the geography of the school and its grounds |

### Critical Importance of EYFS Foundations

As HFL Education (2023) note in their progression guidance:

> "The learning from KS1 provides a bedrock foundation for new learning to sit and stick. Without these first steps, children will struggle to understand other content. For example, early experiences with seasons relating to plant growth and knowing there are hot and cold places on the planet provide the basis of a schema in which knowledge about vegetation belts and climate zones will later sit."

EYFS geography should not be viewed as "pre-geography" but as **essential foundational experiences** that establish:
- Spatial awareness and mapping concepts
- Understanding of weather and seasonal change
- Awareness of physical and human features
- Comparative thinking (same/different, here/there)
- Observation and fieldwork skills

## Pedagogical Approaches for EYFS Geography

### 1. Starting with the Immediate

The EYFS framework explicitly states that geography begins with children's **immediate environment**:
- School grounds exploration
- Local walks and visits
- Mapping the classroom and school
- Identifying features children see daily

### 2. Enriching Experiences

The framework emphasises that "the frequency and range of children's personal experiences increases their knowledge and sense of the world around them." This includes:
- Visiting parks, libraries, museums
- Meeting community members (police, nurses, firefighters, shopkeepers)
- Exploring natural environments
- Engaging with technology to explore places

### 3. Learning Through Stories and Texts

Books play a vital role:
- Stories set in different places and cultures
- Non-fiction books about animals, habitats, and environments
- Maps and atlases appropriate for young children
- Books about journeys and travel

### 4. Developing Spatial Thinking

Research (Uttal & Cohen, 2012) demonstrates that spatial thinking skills are **moldable** and that early intervention is valuable:
- Providing opportunities for outdoor exploration where children navigate and follow paths
- Using construction toys and block play
- Engaging with puzzles and shape activities
- Using directional language consistently
- Creating and using simple maps

### 5. Sustained Shared Thinking

The EYFS quality of education guidance emphasises **sustained shared thinking** – the context in which children develop geographical understanding through conversation with adults:
- "What do you notice about this place?"
- "How is this different from where we live?"
- "Where do you think the water goes when it rains?"
- "Why do you think the leaves are changing colour?"

## Assessment at the End of Reception

At the end of Reception, teachers assess whether children have met the **Early Learning Goals** for People, Culture and Communities and The Natural World.

The assessment is **holistic** – based on:
- Observation of child-initiated activity
- Adult-led learning sessions
- Learning across the curriculum (not isolated geography "tests")

Children are assessed as:
- **Emerging** – not yet at the expected level
- **Expected** – meeting the level expected for their age
- **Exceeding** – working beyond the expected level (though this category is less commonly used in the 2021 framework)

---

## Key Challenges and Considerations

### 1. The "Disappearing Subject"

Because geography is not a separate subject in EYFS, it can become lost within Understanding the World. Schools should:
- Ensure curriculum planning explicitly addresses geographical content
- Monitor coverage of the two geography-focused ELGs
- Build progression from EYFS into KS1 consciously

### 2. Resource Limitations

Access to high-quality geographical resources (globes, maps, atlases suitable for 4-5 year olds) varies. Effective EYFS geography provision requires:
- Age-appropriate maps (aerial photos, pictorial maps)
- Globes that children can handle
- Non-fiction books about places and environments
- Natural materials for exploration

### 3. Outdoor Learning

The Natural World ELG requires regular outdoor access. Schools without suitable outdoor spaces must:
- Use local parks and environments
- Bring natural materials into the classroom
- Use digital resources to supplement direct experience (though not replace it)

### 4. Transition to KS1

The transition from EYFS to Year 1 is critical for geography:
- Reception teachers should ensure children meet the geography ELGs
- Year 1 teachers should build on ELG achievement, not start from scratch
- Schools should have clear progression documents showing how EYFS foundations lead to KS1 National Curriculum content
