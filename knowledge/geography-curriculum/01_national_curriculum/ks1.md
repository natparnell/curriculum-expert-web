# Key Stage 1 Geography: Statutory Requirements

## Introduction

The Key Stage 1 (KS1) geography programme of study applies to Years 1 and 2 in maintained schools in England. This foundational stage builds upon the early geographical learning in the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), where children develop their understanding of the world through exploration and play. At Key Stage 1, geography becomes a more structured subject, introducing pupils to the core concepts, skills, and knowledge that will be developed throughout their geographical education.

The National Curriculum for geography aims to inspire in pupils a curiosity and fascination about the world and its people that will remain with them for the rest of their lives. At Key Stage 1, this aim translates into practical, hands-on learning that connects pupils with their immediate environment while beginning to introduce them to places further afield.

The KS1 programme of study is organised around four interrelated strands: Locational Knowledge, Place Knowledge, Human and Physical Geography, and Geographical Skills and Fieldwork. These strands are taught in an integrated way, using the local area and contrasting locations to develop pupils' geographical understanding.

This document provides a comprehensive account of the statutory requirements for Key Stage 1 geography, drawing upon the official National Curriculum documentation, guidance from the Geographical Association, and insights from geography education research.

## The National Curriculum Requirements

### Statutory Programme of Study

The National Curriculum for geography at Key Stage 1 requires that pupils develop knowledge about the world, the United Kingdom and their locality. The programme of study is organised into four strands:

1. **Locational Knowledge**: Understanding where places are located
2. **Place Knowledge**: Understanding the features and characteristics of places
3. **Human and Physical Geography**: Understanding geographical processes and patterns
4. **Geographical Skills and Fieldwork**: Developing practical geographical skills

### Aims at Key Stage 1

By the end of Key Stage 1, pupils should:

- Develop knowledge about the world, the United Kingdom and their locality
- Understand basic subject-specific vocabulary relating to human and physical geography
- Begin to use geographical skills, including first-hand observation, to enhance their locational awareness

## Locational Knowledge

Pupils should be taught to:

- **Name and locate the world's seven continents and five oceans**: Using maps, atlases and globes to identify these major world features
- **Name, locate and identify characteristics of the four countries and capital cities of the United Kingdom**: Understanding the constituent countries of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) and their capital cities
- **Understand geographical similarities and differences through studying the human and physical geography of a small area of the United Kingdom, and of a small area in a contrasting non-European country**: Comparing localities to identify similarities and differences

### Teaching Approaches

**The World**: Pupils learn about the world through:
- Using globes and world maps
- Learning songs and rhymes to remember continents and oceans
- Simple map work showing the location of the UK in the world

**The United Kingdom**: Pupils learn about the UK through:
- Identifying the four countries on maps
- Learning capital cities
- Understanding that they live in one of these countries
- Simple comparisons between the countries

**Contrasting Localities**: The requirement to study a contrasting non-European country introduces pupils to geographical diversity:
- Selecting an accessible contrasting locality (often in Africa, Asia or South America)
- Comparing human features (how people live) and physical features (climate, landscape)
- Using photographs, videos and stories to bring distant places to life

## Place Knowledge

Pupils should be taught to:

- **Understand geographical similarities and differences through studying the human and physical geography of a small area of the United Kingdom, and of a small area in a contrasting non-European country**

This strand is closely connected to locational knowledge and is taught through the comparison of localities.

### Understanding Place

Pupils develop understanding of place through:

**The Local Area**: Investigating their immediate surroundings
- The school grounds and their features
- The local neighbourhood (streets, buildings, land use)
- How the local area is used by people
- Changes in the local area over time

**A Contrasting Locality**: Studying a place that is different from their own
- Often a locality in a different continent
- Focus on both similarities (people have homes, families, schools) and differences (types of homes, climate, landscape)
- Developing understanding that places can be very different while having common human features

### Human and Physical Features

Pupils learn to identify:

**Human Features**: Features made by people
- Buildings (houses, shops, schools, places of worship)
- Transport (roads, railways, bridges)
- Land use (farms, parks, industrial areas)

**Physical Features**: Natural features
- Relief (hills, valleys, mountains)
- Water features (rivers, lakes, seas, oceans)
- Vegetation (woodlands, grasslands)
- Weather and climate patterns

## Human and Physical Geography

Pupils should be taught to:

- **Identify seasonal and daily weather patterns in the United Kingdom**: Understanding how weather changes through the year and through the day
- **Identify the location of hot and cold areas of the world in relation to the Equator and the North and South Poles**: Understanding basic global climate patterns
- **Use basic geographical vocabulary to refer to**: Key physical features (including beach, cliff, coast, forest, hill, mountain, sea, ocean, river, soil, valley, vegetation, season and weather) and key human features (including city, town, village, factory, farm, house, office, port, harbour and shop)

### Seasonal and Daily Weather Patterns

Pupils investigate weather through:

**Observation**: Recording daily weather using simple weather charts
- Temperature (hot, warm, cool, cold)
- Precipitation (rain, snow, sun)
- Wind (breezy, windy, calm)
- Cloud cover (sunny, cloudy, overcast)

**Seasonal Change**: Understanding how weather changes through the year
- The four seasons in the UK
- How day length changes through the year
- How temperature changes through the year
- Associated changes in nature (leaf fall, flowering, animal behaviour)

### Global Climate Patterns

Pupils begin to understand global patterns:

**The Equator**: The imaginary line around the middle of the Earth where it is hot
- Countries near the Equator are generally hot
- Tropical climates

**The Poles**: The North and South Poles where it is cold
- Arctic and Antarctic regions
- Polar climates

**The UK**: Located between the Equator and the North Pole, giving it a temperate climate with four distinct seasons

### Geographical Vocabulary

Pupils learn and use key geographical terms:

**Physical Features**: Beach, cliff, coast, forest, hill, mountain, sea, ocean, river, soil, valley, vegetation, season, weather

**Human Features**: City, town, village, factory, farm, house, office, port, harbour, shop

## Geographical Skills and Fieldwork

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Starting with the Familiar

Effective KS1 geography starts with what pupils know:

- The school and its grounds
- The journey to school
- The local area
- Building outwards to less familiar places

This approach ensures accessibility while gradually extending geographical horizons.

### Concrete and Experiential

KS1 geography is concrete and hands-on:

- Direct experience of places
- Handling real objects (rocks, soils, leaves)
- Outdoor learning and exploration
- Sensory engagement with environments

### Making Connections

Pupils make connections between:

- The local and the global
- Human and physical geography
- Their own experience and places studied
- Different subjects (science, history, literacy)

### Developing Vocabulary

Geographical vocabulary is developed through:

- Direct teaching of new terms
- Using vocabulary in context
- Word walls and displays
- Encouraging pupils to use geographical language

## Resources for Key Stage 1 Geography

### Maps and Atlases

Essential resources include:

- **Large world map**: For whole-class reference
- **Globe**: To show the Earth as a sphere
- **Atlas**: Age-appropriate atlas for young children
- **Local maps**: Ordnance Survey maps of the local area
- **Aerial photographs**: Images of the school and local area

### Outdoor Learning

The school grounds are a key resource:

- **Weather station**: Simple equipment for recording weather
- **Compass**: For teaching direction
- **Measuring equipment**: For simple measurements
- **Clipboards**: For recording observations outdoors

### Digital Resources

Technology can enhance geographical learning:

- **Google Earth**: Exploring places virtually
- **Virtual field trips**: Visiting places that are inaccessible
- **Weather websites**: Current weather data
- **Interactive maps**: Engaging with digital mapping

## Assessment at Key Stage 1

### Ongoing Assessment

Teachers assess pupils' geographical learning through:

- **Observation**: Watching pupils as they work and play
- **Discussion**: Listening to pupils talk about places and features
- **Written and drawn work**: Reviewing maps, drawings, and written work
- **Fieldwork**: Assessing skills during outdoor activities

### What to Assess

Assessment focuses on:

- **Locational knowledge**: Can pupils name and locate places?
- **Understanding**: Do pupils understand geographical concepts?
- **Vocabulary**: Can pupils use geographical terms accurately?
- **Skills**: Can pupils use maps, atlases, and simple fieldwork techniques?
- **Attitudes**: Do pupils show curiosity about places and the world?

### Progression

By the end of Key Stage 1, pupils should:

- Know the names of continents, oceans, and UK countries
- Understand that places have different physical and human features
- Use simple geographical vocabulary accurately
- Use maps, atlases, and globes with some independence
- Conduct simple fieldwork observations
- Show curiosity about the world and its people

## Transition to Key Stage 2

### Foundations for KS2

Key Stage 1 geography provides foundations for:

- **Locational knowledge**: Basic knowledge of UK and world geography
- **Understanding place**: Experience of studying local and contrasting places
- **Physical and human geography**: Introduction to geographical processes and patterns
- **Skills**: Basic skills in using maps and conducting fieldwork
- **Attitudes**: Curiosity about the world and enthusiasm for geography

### Building on KS1

Key Stage 2 builds on Key Stage 1 by:

- **Extending locational knowledge**: Learning about counties, regions, European countries, and the wider world
- **Deepening place knowledge**: More detailed study of places, including regions of the UK and other countries
- **Developing understanding of processes**: Understanding how physical and human processes shape places
- **Enhancing skills**: More sophisticated map work, fieldwork, and data handling

## Challenges and Considerations

### Time Allocation

Geography, as part of the broader curriculum, may receive limited time:

- **Integration**: Linking geography with other subjects (science, history, literacy)
- **Outdoor learning**: Making the most of the school grounds for geographical learning
- **Focus**: Ensuring that geography is taught with sufficient depth despite time constraints

### Pupil Diversity

Pupils come to geography with different experiences:

- **Some pupils travel widely**: They may have experience of different countries and cultures
- **Some pupils have limited experience**: They may know little beyond their immediate locality
- **EAL pupils**: Pupils learning English may bring knowledge of other places and languages

Teaching should value all pupils' experiences while extending everyone's geographical horizons.

### Resources

Access to resources varies:

- **Maps and globes**: Essential resources that all schools should have
- **Technology**: Access to computers, tablets, and internet varies
- **Local environment**: Some schools have rich local environments; others are more limited

Effective teaching makes the most of available resources and finds creative solutions where resources are limited.

## Conclusion

Key Stage 1 geography provides the foundation for pupils' geographical education. Through the study of the local area and contrasting places, pupils develop locational knowledge, understanding of human and physical geography, and practical geographical skills. The statutory programme of study ensures that all pupils begin their geographical journey with a solid foundation of knowledge, understanding, and skills.

Effective Key Stage 1 geography is hands-on, experiential, and connected to pupils' own experience. It develops curiosity about the world and its people, fostering the fascination with places that is at the heart of geographical education. By the end of Year 2, pupils should have the geographical knowledge, skills, and attitudes that prepare them for the more demanding curriculum of Key Stage 2.

Teachers who provide rich geographical experiences, encourage exploration and questioning, and help pupils make connections between their local world and the wider world give their pupils the best possible start in geography. The investment in early geographical education pays dividends as pupils progress through school, developing into informed, responsible global citizens.
