# National Curriculum Statutory Framework for Geography

## Purpose of Study

A high-quality geography education should inspire in pupils a curiosity and fascination about the world and its people that will remain with them for the rest of their lives. Teaching should equip pupils with knowledge about diverse places, people, resources and natural and human environments, together with a deep understanding of the Earth's key physical and human processes. As pupils progress, their growing knowledge about the world should help them to deepen their understanding of the interaction between physical and human processes, and of the formation and use of landscapes and environments. Geographical knowledge, understanding and skills provide the framework and approaches that explain how the Earth's features at different scales are shaped, interconnected and change over time.

This purpose statement from the Department for Education (DfE, 2013) establishes geography as a subject that combines intellectual rigour with emotional engagement, encouraging pupils to develop both a deep understanding of geographical concepts and a lifelong curiosity about the world around them.

## Legal Basis and Statutory Status

### Maintained Schools

Geography is a statutory National Curriculum subject for all pupils in maintained schools in England from Key Stage 1 through to the end of Key Stage 3 (ages 5–14). The programmes of study set out what pupils must be taught at each key stage, and schools must follow these statutory requirements.

The statutory basis is established in the Education Act 2002 (as amended), which requires the Secretary of State to establish a National Curriculum for certain subjects, including geography.

### Academies and Free Schools

Academies and free schools are not required by law to follow the National Curriculum. However, many choose to do so voluntarily, and all are subject to Ofsted inspection against the same broad standards. The geography curriculum in these settings is typically expected to be at least as ambitious as the National Curriculum.

### Key Stage 4 (Ages 14–16)

Geography is **not** a statutory National Curriculum subject at Key Stage 4. However, the DfE and Ofsted have emphasised that pupils have a statutory entitlement to access a broad and balanced curriculum, including the humanities. The National Curriculum framework document states that all pupils in maintained schools have a statutory entitlement to be able to study a subject from each of the four arts, humanities, design and technology, and modern foreign language areas.

The Royal Geographical Society (with IBG) has consistently advocated for geography to become a statutory subject at Key Stage 4, arguing that geographical understanding is essential for informed citizenship in an increasingly interconnected world.

## Aims of the National Curriculum for Geography

The National Curriculum for geography aims to ensure that all pupils:

### Locational and Place Knowledge

- Develop contextual knowledge of the location of globally significant places – both terrestrial and marine – including their defining physical and human characteristics and how these provide a geographical context for understanding the actions of processes
- Understand the processes that give rise to key physical and human geographical features of the world, how these are interdependent and how they bring about spatial variation and change over time

### Geographical Skills

- Are competent in the geographical skills needed to:
  - Collect, analyse and communicate with a range of data gathered through experiences of fieldwork that deepen their understanding of geographical processes
  - Interpret a range of sources of geographical information, including maps, diagrams, globes, aerial photographs and Geographical Information Systems (GIS)
  - Communicate geographical information in a variety of ways, including through maps, numerical and quantitative skills and writing at length

These aims reflect a balance between substantive geographical knowledge (what pupils should know) and disciplinary geographical knowledge (how geographers think and work), a distinction that has been emphasised in recent Ofsted research.

## Attainment Targets

By the end of each key stage, pupils are expected to know, apply and understand the matters, skills and processes specified in the relevant programme of study. The attainment targets are not broken down into specific level descriptions as in previous versions of the National Curriculum; instead, schools are expected to develop their own assessment approaches that demonstrate pupil progress against the programme of study.

Schools are not required by law to teach the example content given in square brackets in the programmes of study. These are provided as illustrations and suggestions, giving teachers professional autonomy to select content that will best achieve the curriculum aims for their pupils.

## Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS)

While geography is not a distinct subject in the EYFS framework, geographical learning is embedded within the 'Understanding the World' area of learning. The revised EYFS framework (DfE, 2021) organises geographical and historical content into three Early Learning Goals (ELGs):

### Past and Present

Children at the expected level of development will:
- Talk about the lives of the people around them and their roles in society
- Know some similarities and differences between things in the past and now, drawing on their experiences and what has been read in class
- Understand the past through settings, characters and events encountered in books read in class and storytelling

### People, Culture and Communities

Children at the expected level of development will:
- Describe their immediate environment using knowledge from observation, discussion, stories, non-fiction texts and maps
- Know some similarities and differences between different religious and cultural communities in this country, drawing on their experiences and what has been read in class
- Explain some similarities and differences between life in this country and life in other countries, drawing on knowledge from stories, non-fiction texts and – when appropriate – maps

### The Natural World

Children at the expected level of development will:
- Explore the natural world around them, making observations and drawing pictures of animals and plants
- Know some similarities and differences between the natural world around them and contrasting environments, drawing on their experiences and what has been read in class
- Understand some important processes and changes in the natural world around them, including the seasons and changing states of matter

The Geographical Association (2023) emphasises that enabling pupils to take on the role of a geographer, exploring, discovering and beginning to make sense of the world around them, is an important consideration when planning for the seven areas of interconnected learning and development. This involves providing opportunities for both 'first hand' experiences (visits, outdoor exploration) and 'imaginary' experiences (role-play, small world play, stories).

## Key Stage 1 (Ages 5–7)

At Key Stage 1, pupils should develop knowledge about the world, the United Kingdom and their locality. They should understand basic subject-specific vocabulary relating to human and physical geography and begin to use geographical skills, including first-hand observation, to enhance their locational awareness.

### Locational Knowledge

Pupils should be taught to:
- Name and locate the world's seven continents and five oceans
- Name, locate and identify characteristics of the four countries and capital cities of the United Kingdom and its surrounding seas

This locational foundation provides pupils with a basic spatial framework for understanding the world. The specification of 'seven continents' reflects the educational convention used in England (including Europe and Asia as separate continents, with North and South America counted separately).

### Place Knowledge

Pupils should understand geographical similarities and differences through studying the human and physical geography of:
- A small area of the United Kingdom
- A small area in a contrasting non-European country

This requirement emphasises comparison as a key geographical skill from the earliest stages, encouraging pupils to identify and explain similarities and differences between places.

### Human and Physical Geography

Pupils should be taught to:
- Identify seasonal and daily weather patterns in the United Kingdom and the location of hot and cold areas of the world in relation to the Equator and the North and South Poles
- Use basic geographical vocabulary to refer to:
  - Key physical features: beach, cliff, coast, forest, hill, mountain, sea, ocean, river, soil, valley, vegetation, season and weather
  - Key human features: city, town, village, factory, farm, house, office, port, harbour and shop

### Geographical Skills and Fieldwork

Pupils should be taught to:
- Use world maps, atlases and globes to identify the United Kingdom and its countries, as well as the countries, continents and oceans studied at this key stage
- Use simple compass directions (north, south, east and west) and locational and directional language [for example, near and far, left and right], to describe the location of features and routes on a map
- Use aerial photographs and plan perspectives to recognise landmarks and basic human and physical features; devise a simple map; and use and construct basic symbols in a key
- Use simple fieldwork and observational skills to study the geography of their school and its grounds and the key human and physical features of its surrounding environment

## Key Stage 2 (Ages 7–11)

At Key Stage 2, pupils should extend their knowledge and understanding beyond the local area to include the United Kingdom and Europe, North and South America. This will include the location and characteristics of a range of the world's most significant human and physical features. They should develop their use of geographical knowledge, understanding and skills to enhance their locational and place knowledge.

### Locational Knowledge

Pupils should be taught to:
- Locate the world's countries, using maps to focus on Europe (including the location of Russia) and North and South America, concentrating on their environmental regions, key physical and human characteristics, countries and major cities
- Name and locate counties and cities of the United Kingdom, geographical regions and their identifying human and physical characteristics, key topographical features (including hills, mountains, coasts and rivers), and land-use patterns; and understand how some of these aspects have changed over time
- Identify the position and significance of latitude, longitude, Equator, Northern Hemisphere, Southern Hemisphere, the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, Arctic and Antarctic Circle, the Prime/Greenwich Meridian and time zones (including day and night)

The requirement to study time zones, latitude and longitude introduces more abstract spatial concepts that build on the foundational knowledge from Key Stage 1.

### Place Knowledge

Pupils should understand geographical similarities and differences through the study of human and physical geography of:
- A region of the United Kingdom
- A region in a European country
- A region in North or South America

### Human and Physical Geography

Pupils should be taught to describe and understand key aspects of:

**Physical geography:**
- Climate zones, biomes and vegetation belts
- Rivers, mountains, volcanoes and earthquakes
- The water cycle

**Human geography:**
- Types of settlement and land use
- Economic activity including trade links
- The distribution of natural resources including energy, food, minerals and water

### Geographical Skills and Fieldwork

Pupils should be taught to:
- Use maps, atlases, globes and digital/computer mapping to locate countries and describe features studied
- Use the eight points of a compass, four- and six-figure grid references, symbols and key (including the use of Ordnance Survey maps) to build their knowledge of the United Kingdom and the wider world
- Use fieldwork to observe, measure, record and present the human and physical features in the local area using a range of methods, including sketch maps, plans and graphs, and digital technologies

The progression in map skills from Key Stage 1 is significant: from simple compass directions to eight-point compass use; from basic symbols to six-figure grid references; from simple maps to Ordnance Survey maps.

## Key Stage 3 (Ages 11–14)

At Key Stage 3, pupils should consolidate and extend their knowledge of the world's major countries and their physical and human features. They should understand how geographical processes interact to create distinctive human and physical landscapes that change over time. In doing so, they should become aware of increasingly complex geographical systems in the world around them.

Pupils should develop greater competence in using geographical knowledge, approaches and concepts [such as models and theories] and geographical skills in analysing and interpreting different data sources. In this way pupils will continue to enrich their locational knowledge and spatial and environmental understanding.

### Locational Knowledge

Pupils should extend their locational knowledge and deepen their spatial awareness of the world's countries, using maps of the world to focus on:
- Africa
- Russia
- Asia (including China and India)
- The Middle East

The study should focus on their environmental regions, including polar and hot deserts, key physical and human characteristics, countries and major cities.

### Place Knowledge

Pupils should understand geographical similarities, differences and links between places through the study of the human and physical geography of:
- A region in Africa
- A region in Asia

### Human and Physical Geography

Pupils should understand, through the use of detailed place-based exemplars at a variety of scales, the key processes in:

**Physical geography relating to:**
- Geological timescales and plate tectonics
- Rocks, weathering and soils
- Weather and climate, including the change in climate from the Ice Age to the present
- Glaciation, hydrology and coasts

**Human geography relating to:**
- Population and urbanisation
- International development
- Economic activity in the primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary sectors
- The use of natural resources

Pupils should understand how human and physical processes interact to influence and change landscapes, environments and the climate; and how human activity relies on the effective functioning of natural systems.

### Geographical Skills and Fieldwork

Pupils should:
- Build on their knowledge of globes, maps and atlases, and apply and develop this knowledge routinely in the classroom and in the field
- Interpret Ordnance Survey maps in the classroom and the field, including using grid references and scale, topographical and other thematic mapping, and aerial and satellite photographs
- Use Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to view, analyse and interpret places and data
- Use fieldwork in contrasting locations to collect, analyse and draw conclusions from geographical data, using multiple sources of increasingly complex information

The inclusion of GIS at Key Stage 3 reflects the increasing importance of digital technologies in geographical practice and the need for pupils to develop data literacy skills.

## Curriculum Design Principles

### Developing the Whole Curriculum

The programmes of study specify what must be taught but do not prescribe how the curriculum should be organised or taught. Schools have autonomy to design their curriculum in ways that best meet the needs of their pupils, provided they cover the statutory content.

Ofsted's research review on geography (2021) identified several principles for curriculum design:

1. **Ambition for all**: The curriculum should be sufficiently ambitious for all pupils, including the most disadvantaged and those with special educational needs or disabilities.

2. **Sequencing**: Content should be sequenced so that pupils build knowledge and skills progressively, with foundational concepts taught before more complex ones.

3. **Substantive and disciplinary knowledge**: The curriculum should develop both substantive knowledge (knowledge of the world) and disciplinary knowledge (how geographers think, work and know).

4. **Breadth and depth**: The curriculum should balance breadth of coverage with depth of understanding, avoiding superficial 'topic-hopping'.

### Local Context

Schools are encouraged to use their local area as a starting point for geographical enquiry, particularly in the early years and primary phases. The statutory requirements include study of the local area at Key Stage 1 and fieldwork in the local area at Key Stage 2.

### Cross-Curricular Links

Geography has natural links with other subjects, including:
- **History**: Through study of how places and landscapes have changed over time
- **Science**: Through study of physical processes, ecosystems and environmental science
- **Mathematics**: Through use of data, graphs, scales and coordinates
- **English**: Through reading and writing about places and geographical issues
- **Computing**: Through use of GIS, digital mapping and data analysis

## Assessment and Reporting

### End of Key Stage Assessment

There are no statutory national tests or assessments in geography at the end of any key stage. Schools are responsible for developing their own approaches to assessing pupil progress against the programme of study.

Ofsted inspectors will evaluate how well schools are:
- Checking what pupils have learned
- Identifying gaps in pupils' knowledge
- Using assessment information to inform future teaching

### Reporting to Parents

Schools must report annually to parents on their child's progress and attainment. For geography, this is typically included within broader reports on humanities or as part of a general assessment of the child's progress across the curriculum.

## Pedagogical Implications

### Teaching for Understanding

The National Curriculum purpose statement emphasises that teaching should equip pupils with knowledge and understanding, not merely factual recall. This requires pedagogical approaches that:
- Make explicit connections between concepts
- Use varied examples to develop transferable understanding
- Provide opportunities for application and reasoning

### Developing Geographical Skills

The programmes of study specify geographical skills that must be developed at each key stage. Teachers should ensure that skills are taught explicitly and practised regularly, not left to incidental development.

### Fieldwork

Fieldwork is specified as a statutory requirement at all key stages from 1 to 3. This reflects the central importance of direct experience of the environment in geographical education. Fieldwork should:
- Be properly planned and integrated with classroom learning
- Involve pupils in active investigation, not just passive observation
- Build progressively in complexity from Key Stage 1 to Key Stage 3

### Use of Technology

The Key Stage 3 programme of study specifically requires pupils to use GIS. Schools should consider how technology can support geographical learning across all key stages, including use of:
- Digital mapping and virtual globes
- Aerial and satellite imagery
- Data analysis tools
- Online resources for place study
