# Decision-Making Exercises and Role Play in Geography

## Introduction: Why Experiential Learning Matters

Decision-making exercises (DMEs) and role play activities represent powerful pedagogical approaches in geography education that enable students to engage directly with complex real-world scenarios. As Margaret Roberts notes, "Some of the best lessons I have observed have been public meeting role play lessons. What distinguished these lessons was the high degree of student engagement with geographical subject matter throughout the lesson" (Roberts, 2023, p. 174). These experiential learning strategies move beyond passive consumption of geographical knowledge, requiring students to actively apply understanding, evaluate alternatives, and develop reasoned arguments.

The Geographical Association (GA) identifies decision-making exercises, role plays, and simulations as core components of enquiry-based and experiential learning alongside fieldwork. These activities share a common purpose: they use real-world scenarios for students to experience and learn from, bringing geographical relevance and enabling students to imaginatively put themselves into situations where they must think through problems they are presented with (GA, 2024).

The educational philosopher Margaret Roberts argues that "education should enable students to make sense of the world for themselves, to be critical of information, to enable them to participate in decision making and to promote their own social and intellectual development so that they can get more out of life and contribute more to society" (Roberts, 2013, p. 22). Decision-making exercises and role play directly support this educational purpose by creating authentic contexts where students must navigate complexity, weigh competing interests, and justify their reasoning.

## Understanding Decision-Making Exercises

### What Are Decision-Making Exercises?

Decision-making exercises (DMEs) in geography are structured activities where an issue or question is identified and investigated within a real-world context. Teachers use these activities to provide authentic scenarios where students apply and develop their geographical knowledge and skills. Students are placed in situations where they must evaluate alternatives and reach justifiable decisions, engaging deeply with geographical issues and gaining critical understanding of the kinds of evidence and skills used for genuine decision making in professional geographical contexts.

A typical DME presents students with a geographical problem that requires resolution—such as selecting the optimal location for a new development, determining the most appropriate coastal management strategy for a vulnerable coastline, or weighing competing land uses in an area under pressure from multiple stakeholders. The exercise provides students with contextual information, data, and stakeholder perspectives, then requires them to analyse this information systematically before reaching and justifying a conclusion.

The Geographical Association's Living Geography project provides exemplar materials, including the widely-used "A New Stadium for Rotherham United – A Siting Exercise" case study, which demonstrates how decision-making activities can be structured around genuine local geographical questions. Such exercises require students to balance physical, human, economic, and environmental factors while working within real-world constraints.

### Decision-Making in GCSE Examinations

Decision-making exercises have particular significance in GCSE geography specifications. Both AQA and Eduqas include decision-making components within their assessment structures, recognising that the ability to evaluate evidence and reach reasoned conclusions represents a core geographical skill.

AQA GCSE Geography Paper 3 includes a synoptic assessment that takes the form of a decision-making exercise. Students encounter an unfamiliar geographical issue requiring them to draw together knowledge, understanding, and skills from across the specification. This typically involves evaluating options for managing a geographical challenge, considering multiple perspectives, and reaching a justified conclusion. Internet Geography and other resource providers have developed extensive materials to support teacher and student preparation for this component, including DMEs on coastal management at Withernsea on the Holderness Coast.

Eduqas similarly incorporates decision-making elements within their assessment framework, requiring students to demonstrate the ability to evaluate alternatives and make geographical decisions based on evidence. The decision-making exercise serves as a vehicle for synoptic assessment, ensuring that students can integrate learning from across physical and human geography topics.

### Why Decision-Making Activities Are Important for Geographical Learning

Decision-making activities serve multiple important functions in geographical education:

**Cognitive Challenge:** These activities are designed to challenge students by placing them in positions where they must think hard about complex issues. While contexts must remain comprehensible, effective decision-making exercises provide tasks just beyond students' present capabilities, requiring them to stretch their thinking. The Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky described this productive struggle as operating within the "zone of proximal development"—the gap between what a student can do independently and what they can achieve with support from more able peers or adults (GA, 2024).

**Application of Knowledge:** DMEs require students to apply geographical knowledge in authentic contexts, moving beyond recall to demonstrate genuine understanding. Students must draw on substantive geographical knowledge about processes, places, and patterns while also deploying procedural knowledge—the skills of analysis, evaluation, and synthesis.

**Development of Critical Thinking:** By requiring evaluation of alternatives, consideration of multiple perspectives, and justification of conclusions, decision-making exercises develop critical thinking capabilities that transfer beyond geography to wider educational and life contexts.

**Preparation for Citizenship:** Many geographical decisions—about urban development, environmental management, resource allocation, and hazard response—are also matters of public policy and democratic deliberation. Engaging with decision-making exercises prepares students to participate effectively in the geographical dimensions of citizenship.

### Managing Decision-Making Activities

Effective management of decision-making exercises requires careful planning:

**Selecting Appropriate Contexts:** Teachers must choose scenarios that are geographically valid, appropriately challenging, and engaging for students. The context should require genuine geographical thinking rather than offering obvious answers.

**Providing Adequate Information:** Students need sufficient data to make informed decisions, but not so much that they become overwhelmed. Information should be presented in varied formats—maps, graphs, photographs, written sources, and data tables—to develop students' capacity to work with diverse geographical information.

**Supporting the Decision-Making Process:** Teachers should scaffold the decision-making process, helping students to identify criteria for evaluation, weigh evidence systematically, and structure their reasoning. Some students may benefit from decision-making frameworks or graphic organisers.

**Managing Discussion:** Like other forms of decision-making activities, effective DMEs are collaborative activities that promote student talk and discussion (GA, 2024). Teachers must facilitate productive discussion, ensuring that all students participate and that geographical reasoning remains central.

**Debriefing:** Following the decision-making activity, structured debriefing is essential. This should explore not just what decisions students reached, but how they reached them, what geographical concepts they applied, and how confident they are in their conclusions.

## The Role of Mysteries in Geographical Learning

### How Mysteries Work

Mysteries represent a specific form of decision-making and problem-solving activity that originated in the influential "Thinking Through Geography" project. In a mystery, students are presented with a scenario and a question to investigate, along with a set of information slips containing clues, data, and perspectives related to the issue.

Students work in groups to arrange, classify, and make sense of the information slips, gradually building understanding of the geographical situation. The mystery format encourages collaborative thinking, discussion, and the construction of shared understanding. Unlike traditional comprehension exercises where students extract information from a single text, mysteries require students to actively select, sequence, and connect disparate pieces of information.

The mystery format is particularly effective for developing:

- **Categorisation skills:** Students must group information slips by theme, perspective, or type
- **Chronological reasoning:** When mysteries involve change over time, students must sequence events
- **Causal reasoning:** Students identify connections between factors and outcomes
- **Evaluation of reliability:** Students assess the credibility and usefulness of different information sources

### Implementing Mysteries in the Classroom

Successful mystery activities require careful preparation:

**Designing Information Slips:** Each slip should contain a discrete piece of information—an observation, a statistic, a perspective, or a document extract. Slips should vary in their clarity, relevance, and reliability, requiring students to exercise critical judgement.

**Structuring the Task:** The central question should be open-ended enough to permit multiple valid responses while requiring genuine geographical reasoning to answer. Students should understand that the goal is not simply to arrange slips but to use them to construct an argument or reach a decision.

**Facilitating Group Work:** Mysteries are inherently collaborative. Teachers should establish clear expectations for group interaction and provide appropriate scaffolding for students who find independent group work challenging.

**Managing the Plenary:** The debriefing phase should explore both the substantive geographical content and the process of collaborative reasoning. How did students decide which information was most important? What disagreements arose, and how were they resolved?

## Role Play and Drama in Geography

### Why Use Role Play and Drama?

Role play and drama activities offer distinctive opportunities for geographical learning that complement decision-making exercises. As the Geographical Association explains, "role play helps students understand different viewpoints in the context of particular issues and provides opportunities to develop and rehearse reasoned argument" (GA, 2024).

Role play activities typically involve students taking on specific roles—often representing different stakeholders in a geographical issue—and participating in structured discussion or debate from that perspective. Common formats include:

- **Public meetings:** Students represent different interest groups debating a proposed development or policy
- **Planning inquiries:** Students adopt roles in a simulated planning process
- **Environmental tribunals:** Students consider competing claims about environmental management
- **Community consultations:** Students represent residents, developers, and authorities in discussing local change

These activities are particularly valuable for:

**Developing Empathy and Perspective-Taking:** By requiring students to inhabit perspectives different from their own, role play develops the capacity to understand how different people experience and value places differently. This is particularly important in geography, where issues often involve competing claims about how spaces should be used and valued.

**Practising Argumentation:** Role play provides a structured context for students to develop and present arguments. The "role" provides permission to advocate for positions students might not personally hold, enabling them to explore the reasoning behind different viewpoints.

**Engaging with Complexity:** Real geographical issues involve multiple stakeholders with legitimate but conflicting interests. Role play captures this complexity in ways that simplified textbook accounts often cannot.

**Building Oracy Skills:** The emphasis on speaking, listening, and responding develops students' oracy capabilities alongside their geographical understanding.

### Planning and Managing Role Play

The success of role play activities depends heavily on careful planning:

**Assessing Prior Learning:** For role play to contribute to geographical learning, students must have sufficient prior understanding to take on their roles convincingly. Teachers must determine what geographical knowledge is essential and ensure students possess it before the role play begins.

**Selecting Stimulating Topics:** The geographical issue must be genuinely engaging for students. Topics involving controversy, uncertainty, and real stakes tend to generate more authentic engagement than those where the "right answer" is obvious.

**Designing Roles:** Roles should represent genuinely different perspectives on the issue, not simply pro and con positions. Students should receive role cards explaining their character's background, interests, and key arguments, with sufficient detail to support authentic participation.

**Deciding on Preparation Approaches:** Teachers must decide whether to provide role cards with all necessary information or require students to research their roles independently. The latter approach develops research skills but requires more time and support.

**Managing Role Assignment:** Consider carefully how to assign roles. Will you allocate roles randomly, allow students to choose, or assign strategically based on student capabilities? Some students may need particular support to participate effectively.

**Resourcing the Activity:** Consider what resources will enhance the role play. Do you want students to get "into role" with props? Will visual materials support the scenario? How should the classroom be arranged?

**Allocating Time:** Effective role play requires sufficient time for both the activity itself and thorough debriefing. Rushing either phase undermines the learning potential.

**Planning Teacher Intervention:** What interventions will the teacher make during the role play? While over-intervention can disrupt the flow, strategic prompts may help groups who are struggling to engage with the geographical substance.

**Organising Debriefing:** The debriefing phase is where much of the learning occurs. Plan structured opportunities for students to reflect on what they learned about the geographical issue, how taking different perspectives affected their understanding, and what they noticed about the process of discussion and decision-making.

### Drama Strategies for Geography

Beyond formal role play, various drama strategies can enhance geographical learning. Biddulph et al (2021) outline several approaches particularly suited to geography:

**Freeze Frame:** Students create still images representing a scenario—such as a community affected by flooding, or a street scene in a changing neighbourhood. This technique encourages close observation and discussion of the human experiences embedded in geographical processes.

**Thought Tracking:** While holding a freeze frame, individual students are invited to speak their character's thoughts aloud. This develops empathy and reveals the subjective dimensions of geographical issues.

**Conscience Alley:** Students line up in two facing rows to represent different sides of a dilemma. A student "walks the alley" between them, hearing arguments from each side. This structures exploration of complex decisions.

**Hot Seating:** One student takes on a role (such as a resident, a planner, or an environmental campaigner) and answers questions from classmates. This develops questioning skills alongside understanding of perspectives.

## Decision-Making Across the Key Stages

### Early Years and Key Stage 1

While formal decision-making exercises may be too abstract for very young children, the foundations for geographical decision-making can be laid through simple choices about the environment. Children might decide how to arrange the outdoor learning area, choose between routes on a walk, or contribute to decisions about caring for plants or animals. The emphasis should be on experiencing that choices have consequences and that different people may have different preferences.

### Key Stage 2

At Key Stage 2, students can engage with structured decision-making activities appropriate to their developing cognitive capacities. Simple DMEs might involve choosing locations for facilities within the school grounds, evaluating routes for a journey, or deciding how to respond to a local environmental issue. Role plays can be introduced with clear structures and supported preparation.

The Geography National Curriculum requires that students "use fieldwork to observe, measure, record and present the human and physical features in the local area using a range of methods, including sketch maps, plans and graphs, and digital technologies." Decision-making activities provide meaningful contexts for applying these fieldwork skills.

### Key Stage 3

Key Stage 3 represents a crucial period for developing decision-making capabilities. The National Curriculum states that students should "understand how human and physical processes interact to influence, and change landscapes, environments and the climate; and how human activity relies on effective functioning of natural systems." Decision-making exercises provide ideal contexts for exploring these interactions.

At this stage, students can engage with more complex DMEs involving multiple variables, longer timescales, and greater uncertainty. Role plays can involve more independent research and preparation, with students taking greater responsibility for developing their characters' arguments.

The curriculum also requires that students "build on their knowledge of globes, maps and atlases and apply and develop this knowledge routinely in the classroom and in the field." Decision-making activities should routinely require students to work with diverse geographical information sources.

### Key Stage 4 (GCSE)

At GCSE, decision-making becomes a formal assessed skill, particularly in the synoptic components of examination specifications. Students must demonstrate the ability to:

- Evaluate alternative courses of action in unfamiliar contexts
- Synthesise evidence from multiple sources
- Consider short-term and long-term implications
- Reach justified conclusions that recognise uncertainty and complexity

Teaching at this stage should explicitly prepare students for these assessment requirements while maintaining the pedagogical value of decision-making as a mode of learning. Past examination DMEs and similar activities should be used regularly to develop students' confidence and capabilities.

The Ofsted research review for geography (2021) emphasises the importance of students developing genuine expertise in geographical practice. Decision-making exercises and role plays support this by requiring students to work with geographical evidence and reasoning in ways that mirror professional geographical practice.

### Post-16 (A Level)

At A Level, decision-making activities can become more sophisticated, reflecting the greater maturity and subject knowledge of students. The Ofsted research review notes that post-16 geography should develop students' capacity for independent thinking and their understanding of the contested nature of geographical knowledge.

Role plays and decision-making exercises at this level might involve:

- Extended independent research into complex issues
- Engagement with academic geographical debates
- Consideration of ethical dimensions of geographical decisions
- Critical evaluation of the decision-making frameworks themselves

The GA notes that post-16 teaching strategies should develop "student abilities in rapid thinking and reaction to questions, decision-making, analytical reasoning skills and their abilities in presenting a case" (GA, 2025).

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Ensuring Geographical Focus

A common risk with decision-making exercises and role plays is that they become dominated by generic discussion skills or personal opinion rather than geographical reasoning. Teachers must ensure that activities are tightly focused on geographical concepts, evidence, and argumentation.

**Solution:** Provide explicit geographical frameworks for decision-making. Require students to reference specific geographical evidence, processes, or concepts in their contributions. During debriefing, foreground the geographical learning rather than simply discussing who "won" the debate.

### Managing Dominant Personalities

Role plays and group decision-making activities can be dominated by confident students, while quieter students remain marginalised.

**Solution:** Use structured participation strategies such as allocated speaking time, written preparation requirements, or roles that require particular students to contribute specific points. Consider assigning roles strategically to give quieter students positions that require contribution.

### Maintaining Inclusive Environments

Some students may feel uncomfortable with the performative aspects of role play, or may hold perspectives that differ from the majority of the class.

**Solution:** Emphasise that role play involves taking on perspectives rather than expressing personal views. Establish clear ground rules for respectful interaction. Provide alternative participation structures for students who find role play particularly challenging.

### Ensuring Challenge for All

Decision-making activities can result in some students being insufficiently challenged while others struggle.

**Solution:** Differentiate through role complexity, information provision, or outcome expectations rather than through fundamentally different tasks. Use collaborative structures that enable peer support while ensuring all students engage with challenging geographical thinking.

### Time Management

Role plays and extended decision-making activities can easily overrun, leaving insufficient time for debriefing.

**Solution:** Be realistic about what can be accomplished in available time. Consider splitting extended activities across multiple lessons. Always protect time for debriefing—this is where much of the learning occurs.

## Assessment of Decision-Making and Role Play

### Formative Assessment Opportunities

Decision-making exercises and role plays provide rich opportunities for formative assessment. Teachers can observe and gather evidence about:

- Students' ability to apply geographical knowledge in novel contexts
- Capacity to evaluate evidence and reach justified conclusions
- Skills in constructing and presenting geographical arguments
- Ability to work effectively with diverse sources of geographical information
- Capacity to understand and represent multiple perspectives
- Development of oracy and collaborative working capabilities

### Summative Assessment Considerations

While decision-making exercises and role plays are primarily formative in nature, they can contribute to summative assessment through:

- Written outcomes produced during or following activities (decision reports, evaluations, reflective accounts)
- Extended writing that draws on understanding developed through experiential activities
- Portfolio evidence documenting engagement with complex geographical issues
- Performance indicators captured in structured observation schedules

## Conclusion

Decision-making exercises and role play represent essential pedagogical approaches in geography education, enabling students to move beyond passive reception of knowledge toward active engagement with complex real-world scenarios. These approaches develop not only geographical knowledge and skills but also broader capabilities in critical thinking, argumentation, empathy, and collaborative working that serve students throughout their education and beyond.

The Geographical Association's extensive guidance emphasises that activities such as decision-making, role play, and simulations "use real-world scenarios for students to experience and learn from" (GA, 2024). This experiential dimension is central to effective geography teaching, connecting classroom learning to the complexities of places, processes, and issues that constitute the discipline.

Teachers implementing these approaches should attend carefully to planning, management, and debriefing. The quality of geographical learning depends less on the inherent interest of the scenario than on how effectively teachers scaffold student engagement with geographical concepts, evidence, and argumentation. With thoughtful implementation, decision-making exercises and role play can transform geography classrooms into spaces of genuine intellectual engagement, where students develop the capacity to think geographically about the complex decisions that shape our world.
