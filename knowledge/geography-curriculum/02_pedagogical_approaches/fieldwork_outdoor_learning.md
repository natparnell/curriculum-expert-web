# Fieldwork and Outdoor Learning in Geography

## Introduction

Fieldwork lies at the heart of geographical education, representing the distinctive contribution of the discipline to the school curriculum. It is through fieldwork that pupils encounter the real world beyond the classroom, applying and testing geographical concepts, developing investigative skills, and fostering a deeper connection with places and environments. The National Curriculum for Geography in England places significant emphasis on fieldwork, requiring that pupils undertake both local fieldwork and fieldwork in contrasting locations.

Outdoor learning in geography extends beyond formal fieldwork to encompass any learning that takes place outside the classroom, including the school grounds, local area, and more distant locations. This approach recognises that the world is the geographer's laboratory, and that direct experience of places, processes, and patterns is essential for developing geographical understanding.

This document examines the role of fieldwork and outdoor learning in geography education at Key Stages 1-3, drawing upon the National Curriculum requirements, guidance from the Geographical Association, Ofsted research, and evidence from geography education research. It addresses the purposes of fieldwork, different approaches, practical considerations, and the challenges facing fieldwork in contemporary education.

## The National Curriculum Requirements

### Statutory Fieldwork Requirements

The National Curriculum for Geography sets out clear requirements for fieldwork:

**Key Stage 1 (Years 1-2)**

Pupils should:
- Use simple fieldwork and observational skills to study the geography of their school and its grounds and the key human and physical features of its surrounding environment

This requirement establishes fieldwork as part of geography from the earliest years, focusing on familiar, accessible environments. The emphasis is on simple skills and observation, laying foundations for more complex work later.

**Key Stage 2 (Years 3-6)**

Pupils should:
- Use fieldwork to observe, measure, record and present the human and physical features in the local area using a range of methods, including sketch maps, plans and graphs, and digital technologies

At Key Stage 2, fieldwork becomes more systematic, requiring pupils to use a wider range of methods and to present their findings. The focus on the local area ensures accessibility while developing skills that can be applied to more distant places.

**Key Stage 3 (Years 7-9)**

Pupils should:
- Use fieldwork in contrasting locations to collect, analyse and draw conclusions from geographical data, using multiple sources of increasingly complex information

Key Stage 3 fieldwork involves greater complexity in terms of both data collection and analysis. The requirement for "contrasting locations" ensures that pupils experience a range of environments, not just their immediate locality.

### The Distinctive Nature of Geographical Fieldwork

The National Curriculum recognises that geographical fieldwork is distinctive from other forms of outdoor learning. Geography fieldwork specifically involves:

- **Application of geographical concepts**: Testing and applying concepts learned in the classroom in real-world settings
- **Collection of geographical data**: Gathering information about places, patterns, and processes
- **Spatial thinking**: Using maps, plans, and spatial frameworks to understand locations and distributions
- **Investigation of human and physical features**: Studying both the natural environment and human patterns
- **Use of geographical techniques**: Employing methods such as observation, measurement, sampling, and mapping

## Purposes of Fieldwork

### Developing Geographical Understanding

Fieldwork enables pupils to encounter the complexity and messiness of the real world, moving beyond the simplified representations found in textbooks and classroom resources. Through fieldwork, pupils:

- **Experience places directly**: Seeing, hearing, smelling, and touching places creates more powerful learning than any mediated experience
- **Understand scale**: Grasping the spatial extent of features and the relationships between them
- **Recognise pattern and process**: Observing how geographical processes shape places and create patterns
- **Appreciate interconnectedness**: Understanding how physical and human features interact in specific places

### Building Investigative Skills

Fieldwork develops the skills of geographical investigation:

- **Observation**: Learning to look carefully and systematically at the environment
- **Measurement**: Using appropriate instruments and techniques to quantify features
- **Sampling**: Understanding how to select representative data points
- **Recording**: Developing strategies for documenting observations and measurements
- **Analysis**: Interpreting field data and drawing conclusions
- **Presentation**: Communicating findings through maps, graphs, diagrams, and written reports

### Fostering Engagement and Responsibility

Fieldwork contributes to pupils' broader development:

- **Engagement with the environment**: Developing curiosity about and appreciation for the world
- **Sense of place**: Building connections with local and distant places
- **Environmental awareness**: Understanding environmental issues through direct experience
- **Responsibility**: Recognising human impacts on environments and considering sustainability
- **Personal development**: Building confidence, resilience, and teamwork through outdoor experiences

## Approaches to Fieldwork

### Local Fieldwork

Local fieldwork, conducted in the school grounds or immediate vicinity, offers several advantages:

**Accessibility**: Local fieldwork is logistically straightforward, requiring minimal travel and cost. It can be conducted within a single lesson or over short periods.

**Frequency**: Because local fieldwork is accessible, it can be conducted regularly throughout the year, allowing pupils to observe change over time.

**Connection to curriculum**: Local fieldwork can be tightly integrated with classroom learning, with pupils moving between classroom and field to test ideas and gather data.

**Ownership**: Regular engagement with the local area fosters a sense of ownership and care for the environment.

Examples of local fieldwork include:
- Mapping the school grounds
- Investigating microclimates around the school
- Studying land use in the local area
- Monitoring weather conditions
- Observing seasonal changes in vegetation

### Residential Fieldwork

Residential fieldwork involves staying overnight in a contrasting location, typically for Year 6 or Key Stage 3 pupils. Benefits include:

**Immersion**: Extended time in a location allows for deeper engagement and more comprehensive investigation.

**Contrasting environments**: Residential trips typically take pupils to environments different from their home area (coastal, rural, upland), broadening their geographical experience.

**Independence**: Time away from home develops pupils' independence, resilience, and social skills.

**Intensity**: The concentrated nature of residential fieldwork allows for ambitious investigations and strong group bonding.

Common destinations for residential fieldwork include:
- Coastal locations (studying coasts, tourism, settlement)
- National Parks (studying upland environments, tourism, conservation)
- Urban centres (studying urban land use, regeneration, sustainability)
- Field study centres (purpose-built facilities with equipment and expertise)

### Virtual Fieldwork

Virtual fieldwork, using digital technologies to explore distant places without physical travel, has grown in importance:

**Google Earth and Street View**: Allow exploration of any location globally, viewing landscapes, settlement patterns, and human features.

**Virtual tours**: Museums, national parks, and heritage sites offer virtual tours that can be used for geographical learning.

**Live feeds**: Webcams from around the world show real-time conditions in different environments.

**Simulations**: Digital simulations allow exploration of processes (flooding, coastal erosion) that cannot be directly observed.

While virtual fieldwork cannot replace direct experience, it offers access to places and processes that would otherwise be inaccessible due to distance, cost, or safety considerations.

## Fieldwork Techniques

### Observation

Systematic observation is the foundation of fieldwork:

**Sketching**: Drawing landscapes, buildings, or features develops looking skills and creates records for analysis.

**Photography**: Taking photographs documents features and allows later analysis and comparison.

**Field sketches**: Annotated drawings that identify and explain geographical features.

**Transects**: Walking a line through an environment and recording observations at regular intervals.

### Measurement

Quantitative fieldwork involves measuring geographical features:

**Physical measurements**: Using instruments to measure weather (temperature, wind, rainfall), river flow, slope angle, etc.

**Human measurements**: Counting pedestrians, traffic, or land use types; measuring building dimensions or spacing.

**Environmental quality surveys**: Using criteria to assess environmental quality in different locations.

### Mapping

Fieldwork often involves creating or using maps:

**Sketch maps**: Simple hand-drawn maps showing the location of features.

**Base maps**: Using Ordnance Survey or other maps as a base for recording field data.

**GIS and digital mapping**: Using tablets or phones to record locations and create digital maps.

**Bi-polar analysis**: Mapping variations in environmental quality across an area.

### Sampling

Understanding sampling is crucial for rigorous fieldwork:

**Random sampling**: Selecting sample points randomly to avoid bias.

**Systematic sampling**: Selecting samples at regular intervals (every 10 metres, every fifth house).

**Stratified sampling**: Dividing the study area into zones and sampling within each zone.

**Opportunistic sampling**: Recording features as they are encountered (less rigorous but often practical).

## Planning and Conducting Fieldwork

### Risk Assessment

Safety is paramount in fieldwork. Teachers must conduct risk assessments considering:

**Environmental hazards**: Traffic, water, steep slopes, uneven ground, weather conditions.

**Activity risks**: Using equipment, crossing roads, working near water.

**Pupil factors**: Medical conditions, allergies, behavioural needs, swimming ability.

**Emergency procedures**: Knowing what to do if something goes wrong, having first aid provision, communication methods.

Risk assessments should be proportionate to the activity—more detailed for adventurous activities, simpler for familiar local work.

### Preparation

Effective fieldwork requires thorough preparation:

**Pre-visit**: Teachers should visit the location beforehand to identify features, risks, and practical arrangements.

**Pupil preparation**: Pupils should understand the purpose of the fieldwork, the methods they will use, and the safety rules.

**Equipment**: Ensuring all necessary equipment is available and working (clipboards, measuring instruments, cameras, etc.).

**Permissions**: Obtaining necessary permissions from landowners, parents, and the school.

### During Fieldwork

During fieldwork, teachers should:

**Brief clearly**: Ensure pupils understand what they are doing and why.

**Monitor safety**: Constant vigilance for hazards and risky behaviour.

**Support learning**: Prompting observation, questioning, and helping pupils make connections.

**Be flexible**: Responding to unexpected findings or changing conditions.

### Follow-Up

Fieldwork is not complete when pupils return to school. Follow-up activities include:

**Data processing**: Organising, presenting, and analysing the data collected.

**Drawing conclusions**: Interpreting findings in relation to geographical concepts and questions.

**Evaluation**: Reflecting on the fieldwork methods and what could be improved.

**Communication**: Sharing findings through reports, presentations, or displays.

## Integrating Fieldwork with the Curriculum

### Making Connections

Fieldwork is most effective when closely integrated with classroom learning:

**Before fieldwork**: Classroom lessons should introduce the concepts and questions that fieldwork will explore, ensuring pupils understand what they are looking for.

**During fieldwork**: Pupils apply classroom learning in the field, testing hypotheses and gathering evidence.

**After fieldwork**: Classroom lessons analyse field data, relate findings to wider contexts, and evaluate the investigation.

This cycle of classroom-field-classroom ensures that fieldwork is purposeful and connected to the curriculum.

### Progression in Fieldwork

Fieldwork skills should develop progressively across Key Stages:

**Key Stage 1**: Simple observation of familiar environments; using senses to explore; basic mapping; no formal data collection.

**Key Stage 2**: More systematic observation; simple measurement; basic data recording; beginning to use geographical vocabulary to explain.

**Key Stage 3**: Structured investigations; multiple data collection methods; analysis and interpretation; evaluation of methods; presentation of findings.

This progression ensures that pupils build on prior experience and develop increasing sophistication in their fieldwork.

## Challenges Facing Fieldwork

### Time and Curriculum Pressures

The greatest challenge for fieldwork is finding time in a crowded curriculum. With pressure to cover content and prepare for examinations, fieldwork can be seen as a luxury rather than an essential component of geography.

Responses to this challenge include:
- Arguing for fieldwork as integral to geographical education, not an add-on
- Integrating fieldwork with other subjects (science, maths, literacy)
- Using local fieldwork that requires minimal time
- Demonstrating the learning value of fieldwork to school leadership

### Cost and Resources

Residential fieldwork in particular can be expensive, creating equity concerns when not all families can afford contributions.

Responses include:
- Prioritising affordable local fieldwork
- Seeking bursaries and funding for pupils who cannot pay
- Using virtual fieldwork to provide contrasting experiences at low cost
- Building fieldwork equipment from inexpensive materials

### Safety and Risk Aversion

Increasing concern about safety and litigation has made some schools wary of fieldwork, particularly residential trips.

Responses include:
- Thorough risk assessment and management
- Following established guidance (Geographical Association, OEAP)
- Building staff competence through training
- Demonstrating that benefits outweigh risks when properly managed

### COVID-19 Impact

The pandemic severely disrupted fieldwork, with many schools unable to conduct outdoor learning for extended periods.

Recovery involves:
- Rebuilding fieldwork programmes
- Addressing gaps in pupils' fieldwork experience
- Using virtual fieldwork as a bridge back to outdoor learning
- Advocating for the importance of fieldwork in post-pandemic education

## The Value of Outdoor Learning

### Beyond Formal Fieldwork

While formal fieldwork is essential, the value of outdoor learning extends more broadly:

**The school grounds**: Outdoor spaces can be used for regular, informal geography learning—observing weather, monitoring seasons, mapping features.

**The local area**: Regular walks in the neighbourhood build geographical knowledge and foster connection with place.

**Outdoor classrooms**: Teaching regular lessons outdoors, using the environment as a stimulus and context for learning.

These approaches recognise that geography is about the world around us, and that learning can happen anywhere, not just in the classroom or on formal field trips.

### Benefits for Pupils

Research and practice demonstrate multiple benefits of outdoor learning:

**Cognitive benefits**: Enhanced memory, improved concentration, deeper conceptual understanding through direct experience.

**Affective benefits**: Increased enjoyment of learning, positive attitudes towards geography, connection with nature.

**Physical benefits**: Physical activity, health benefits from time outdoors.

**Social benefits**: Teamwork, communication, independence, resilience.

**Behavioural benefits**: Improved behaviour and engagement, particularly for pupils who struggle in classroom settings.

## Conclusion

Fieldwork and outdoor learning are essential components of geographical education, providing the direct experience of places and processes that brings geography to life. The National Curriculum's requirements for fieldwork at all Key Stages reflect the importance of this approach, ensuring that all pupils have opportunities to learn outside the classroom.

While challenges exist—time pressures, cost concerns, safety anxieties—the benefits of fieldwork for pupils' geographical understanding, skill development, and personal growth are substantial. Effective fieldwork requires careful planning, integration with the curriculum, and progression across Key Stages.

As geography educators, we have a responsibility to ensure that fieldwork remains central to our subject, advocating for its value and finding creative ways to provide outdoor learning opportunities despite constraints. The world is, after all, the geographer's laboratory, and our pupils deserve regular opportunities to explore it.
