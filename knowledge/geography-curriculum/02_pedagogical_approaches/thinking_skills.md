# Thinking Skills and Graphic Organisers in Geography

The development of thinking skills lies at the heart of effective geography education. Since the late 1990s, geography teachers have pioneered approaches that move beyond the transmission of factual knowledge toward pedagogies that develop students' capacity to think geographically, analyse spatial relationships, and engage critically with complex geographical issues. This knowledge base explores the theoretical foundations, practical strategies, and classroom implementation of thinking skills approaches, with particular attention to the influential "Thinking Through Geography" (TTG) methodology and the role of graphic organisers in supporting geographical learning.

## Theoretical Foundations: Why Thinking Skills Matter in Geography

Geography occupies a distinctive position within the curriculum, offering content that naturally mediates the development of higher-order thinking skills including analysis, synthesis, evaluation, and problem-solving (Leat, 1998). The subject's inherent focus on spatial relationships, interconnections, and complex systems provides fertile ground for developing transferable cognitive skills that extend far beyond the classroom.

### Constructivism and Geographical Learning

The theoretical underpinning of thinking skills approaches draws heavily on constructivist learning theory. David Leat (1998), in his seminal work *Thinking Through Geography*, emphasises that understanding constructivism and cognition is essential for the effective use of thinking strategies in the classroom. Constructivism posits that learners actively build understanding through interaction with new information, rather than passively receiving knowledge. In geography, this translates to students constructing mental models of spatial relationships, causation, and geographical processes through engagement with carefully designed activities.

The implications for pedagogy are profound. Teachers must create opportunities for students to process geographical information actively, make connections between concepts, and articulate their developing understanding. Passive transmission approaches—where teachers present information through lectures or textbook readings—fail to engage the cognitive processes necessary for deep learning. Instead, thinking skills approaches require students to manipulate information, consider multiple perspectives, and justify their reasoning.

### Metacognition: Thinking About Thinking

A central tenet of the TTG approach is the development of metacognition—students' awareness and understanding of their own thought processes. Leat argues that by understanding how they think, students can apply learned strategies to new situations. This transferability is the ultimate goal of thinking skills education: developing learners who can approach unfamiliar geographical problems with a repertoire of cognitive strategies.

The rationale for explicit attention to metacognition rests on extensive research showing that skilled learners possess and deploy metacognitive strategies automatically. Novice learners, by contrast, often fail to monitor their understanding, recognise when they are confused, or select appropriate strategies for particular tasks. Geography teachers using thinking skills approaches explicitly teach students to recognise cognitive challenges, select appropriate strategies, and reflect on the effectiveness of their thinking.

## The Thinking Through Geography Approach

The Thinking Through Geography project, led by David Leat at Newcastle University and subsequently developed through the Geographical Association, represents the most influential attempt to systematise thinking skills pedagogy in geography. The approach emerged from a recognition that geographical enquiry needed to move beyond fieldwork to encompass structured classroom activities that develop specific cognitive capacities.

### Origins and Development

The TTG project began in the late 1990s with funding from the Cognitive Acceleration programme at King's College London. Leat and his colleagues sought to adapt generic thinking skills approaches to the specific demands of geographical learning. The resulting methodology has been refined through extensive classroom research and has influenced geography teaching internationally, with adaptations developed in the Netherlands, Germany, and other countries (Vankan et al., 2006; Applis, 2014).

The second edition of *Thinking Through Geography* (Leat and Nichols, 2016) expanded the original framework to include new strategies and refined guidance on implementation. The approach has also influenced related developments including Community Curriculum Making and project-based learning, where Leat has continued to emphasise the importance of inquiry-based approaches that place students at the centre of the learning process.

### Core TTG Strategies

The TTG framework identifies eight core strategies, each designed to develop specific cognitive capacities while engaging students with geographical content. These strategies are not gimmicks or isolated activities but carefully designed pedagogical tools grounded in cognitive science research.

#### Mysteries

Mysteries represent perhaps the most widely adopted TTG strategy. In a mystery activity, students receive a set of clues on cards and must collaborate to answer a central question that requires inference and the synthesis of multiple pieces of evidence. The clues typically include relevant and irrelevant information, requiring students to evaluate the utility of each piece of evidence.

Research by Leat and colleagues (2013) demonstrates that mysteries are particularly effective for developing students' ability to relate geographical phenomena. In a study examining the effects of mysteries on geographical thinking, students showed significant improvements in their capacity to identify relationships between causes and effects, and to recognise interdependencies between geographical factors.

The pedagogical power of mysteries lies in their capacity to create cognitive dissonance—the uncomfortable feeling of not knowing that motivates learners to resolve uncertainty. Teachers must resist the temptation to resolve this dissonance too quickly, instead allowing students to struggle productively with the complexity of the task. As the Geographical Association guidance notes, "Provide support but do not give them too much 'help' and resist the temptation to solve the question for them. When you intervene, aim to trigger their thinking to consider different strategies rather than give them the answers."

Mysteries also function as powerful diagnostic and formative assessment tools. As students collaborate to solve mysteries, teachers can observe their reasoning processes, identify misconceptions, and assess the sophistication of their geographical thinking. This observational data can then inform subsequent teaching, addressing gaps in understanding before they become entrenched.

#### Living Graphs

Living graphs transform static data representations into dynamic thinking tools. In this strategy, students physically position themselves on a large graph drawn on the floor or projected on a screen, embodying data points and experiencing spatial relationships kinaesthetically. The approach has been adapted for a wide range of geographical contexts, from population dynamics to economic development indicators.

The strategy develops multiple cognitive capacities simultaneously. Students must interpret numerical data, understand coordinate systems, recognise patterns and trends, and consider the stories behind statistical representations. By physically inhabiting the graph, students develop an intuitive understanding of concepts such as gradient, correlation, and outlier that can be difficult to grasp from static representations.

#### Odd One Out

The Odd One Out strategy presents students with sets of geographical phenomena—places, processes, images, or data—and asks them to identify which item does not belong and justify their reasoning. This seemingly simple activity develops sophisticated classification skills and the capacity to identify and articulate criteria for categorisation.

The power of Odd One Out lies in its open-ended nature. Multiple valid answers often exist, depending on the criteria selected. One student might identify an item as the odd one out based on physical characteristics, while another uses economic or social criteria. This plurality creates opportunities for rich classroom discussion as students share and evaluate different reasoning pathways.

The strategy also supports the development of comparative thinking, a fundamental geographical skill. By considering how items are similar and different, students build the cognitive foundations for more complex geographical analysis including regional comparison and the identification of spatial patterns.

#### Mind Movies

Mind Movies develop students' capacity for visualisation and spatial reasoning. In this strategy, students listen to a geographical description—perhaps of a landscape, a process, or a sequence of events—and construct mental images that they then compare and refine through discussion.

The approach addresses the common challenge that students often struggle to visualise geographical phenomena they have not directly experienced. A student in urban London may find it difficult to imagine the processes of coastal erosion or the layout of a shanty town. Mind Movies scaffold the development of these mental representations, building the spatial imagination that underpins geographical understanding.

#### Reading Photographs

This strategy develops visual literacy and the capacity to extract geographical information from images. Students are presented with photographs and taught to move beyond superficial observation to systematic analysis, considering elements such as scale, perspective, cultural context, and what is included or excluded from the frame.

The approach connects to broader developments in visual literacy education and recognises that photographs are not transparent windows onto reality but constructed representations that require critical interpretation. Students learn to question who took a photograph, for what purpose, and how the image might have been manipulated or selected to convey particular messages.

#### Classification

Classification activities require students to sort geographical phenomena into categories based on identified criteria. The strategy develops the fundamental geographical skill of recognising patterns and organising the world's complexity into manageable conceptual frameworks.

More sophisticated classification activities require students to develop their own classification systems rather than applying pre-existing categories. This open-ended approach develops creativity and the capacity to work with geographical complexity, recognising that real-world phenomena rarely fit neatly into simple categories.

#### Fact or Opinion?

This strategy develops critical literacy by requiring students to distinguish factual claims from opinion or value judgements. In an era of information overload and contested geographical narratives, the capacity to evaluate sources and identify bias has never been more important.

The strategy can be extended to consider how factual information can be selected and presented to support particular viewpoints, introducing students to concepts of media literacy and the constructed nature of geographical knowledge.

#### Storytelling

Storytelling activities engage students in narrative thinking, exploring geographical change and process through temporal sequences. Students might reconstruct the history of a landscape, trace the journey of a commodity through global supply chains, or imagine the future of a place under different scenarios.

The strategy recognises the power of narrative for making abstract geographical concepts concrete and memorable. Stories provide scaffolding for understanding causation, sequence, and the human dimensions of geographical processes.

## Graphicacy: Visual Thinking in Geography

Graphicacy—the capacity to interpret and communicate information through visual representations—represents a distinctive dimension of geographical thinking. Balchin (1972) coined the term to describe visual and spatial communication alongside literacy and numeracy, recognising that geographers require specific visual literacy skills to work with maps, diagrams, photographs, and data visualisations.

### The Components of Graphicacy

The Geographical Association identifies several interconnected components of graphicacy that geography teachers must develop:

**Map literacy** encompasses the capacity to interpret and construct maps, understanding conventions such as scale, projection, symbolisation, and generalisation. Beyond technical competence, map literacy requires critical understanding of how maps represent and sometimes distort spatial relationships. Students must learn to question what is shown and what is hidden, how scale affects representation, and how different projections emphasise particular aspects of the Earth's surface.

**Diagrammatic literacy** involves interpreting and creating the diagrams that geographers use to represent processes, systems, and relationships. From cross-sections showing river channel formation to flow diagrams illustrating migration patterns, diagrams condense complex spatial information into manageable visual formats.

**Graph literacy** extends beyond basic interpretation to include critical evaluation of how data is presented. Students must understand how choices about scale, axes, and chart type can emphasise or obscure particular patterns, and how statistical data connects to geographical processes.

**Photographic and image literacy** encompasses the skills needed to extract geographical information from photographs, satellite images, and other visual sources. This includes technical skills (identifying direction of view, estimating scale) and critical capacities (recognising the constructed nature of images, identifying bias in selection and framing).

### Developing Graphicacy Across Key Stages

Progression in graphicacy follows a developmental trajectory from concrete to abstract understanding. Primary-aged students benefit from hands-on work with real maps—local street plans, orienteering maps, simple globes—developing foundational spatial concepts through direct manipulation. Key Stage 3 students can work with more abstract representations, introducing concepts of projection and scale. By Key Stage 4 and beyond, students should be developing critical graphicacy, questioning how visual representations construct geographical knowledge and recognising the power dynamics embedded in mapping practices.

The GA emphasises that geography teachers have a responsibility to develop students' spatial skills and graphicacy so they are able to understand and communicate spatial information and to use maps and other geographic representations effectively. This responsibility extends to critiquing the maps and visualisations students encounter in media and online, developing their capacity to recognise misleading representations and question the assumptions embedded in visual communication.

### GIS and Digital Graphicacy

The emergence of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and digital mapping tools has transformed the landscape of graphicacy. Modern geography students must develop digital spatial literacy—the capacity to create, manipulate, and analyse spatial data using digital tools. The GA provides resources for exploring land cover change using story maps, mapping emotional geographies with heat maps, and visualising population density using dasymetric mapping.

These digital tools offer powerful opportunities for students to engage with authentic geographical data and create their own visualisations. However, they also require explicit teaching of the concepts underlying spatial analysis—students must understand what a heat map represents, why dasymetric mapping might be preferable to choropleth mapping for certain purposes, and how digital tools can both reveal and obscure geographical patterns.

## Graphic Organisers: Tools for Organising Geographical Thinking

Graphic organisers represent structured visual frameworks that support students in organising information, identifying relationships, and making their thinking visible. Unlike the open-ended graphicacy skills described above, graphic organisers are specific tools with defined structures designed to support particular types of thinking.

### The Role of Graphic Organisers in Geographical Learning

Graphic organisers serve multiple functions in the geography classroom:

**Cognitive offloading**: By providing an external structure for organising information, graphic organisers reduce the cognitive load on working memory, allowing students to focus on the higher-order thinking tasks of analysis and evaluation.

**Making thinking visible**: Graphic organisers create tangible records of students' developing understanding that teachers can review and assess. They make the invisible processes of geographical thinking visible and open to discussion and refinement.

**Supporting metacognition**: When students select appropriate organisers for particular tasks and reflect on their effectiveness, they develop metacognitive awareness of their own learning processes.

**Scaffolding writing**: Many graphic organisers translate directly into structures for extended writing, helping students organise their ideas before producing prose responses.

### Types of Graphic Organisers for Geography

**Concept maps and spider diagrams** support the organisation of hierarchical knowledge, showing how specific concepts relate to broader categories. In geography, concept maps can represent how specific case studies illustrate general principles, or how different factors contribute to complex geographical processes.

**Comparison matrices** scaffold the systematic comparison of places, processes, or case studies. By requiring students to identify criteria for comparison and evaluate each case against those criteria, comparison matrices develop the analytical skills needed for synoptic geographical assessment.

**Cause-effect diagrams** (including fishbone diagrams and consequence wheels) support the analysis of causation in geographical systems. These organisers help students move beyond simple single-cause explanations to recognise multiple, interacting factors and distinguish between proximate and underlying causes.

**Systems diagrams** represent the components and flows within geographical systems, whether hydrological cycles, urban systems, or economic flows. These organisers develop students' capacity for systems thinking, recognising how components interact and how changes in one part of a system affect other parts.

**Decision-making frameworks** scaffold the evaluation of geographical decisions and management strategies. These organisers require students to identify criteria for evaluation, assess options against those criteria, and justify recommendations with geographical evidence.

**Venn diagrams and overlapping circles** support the identification of similarity and difference, a fundamental geographical skill. More complex variations involving multiple overlapping circles can represent the intersection of multiple factors in geographical analysis.

**Flow charts and sequence diagrams** represent temporal processes and decision pathways. In geography, these organisers can show the stages in erosion processes, the steps in urban regeneration projects, or the decision-making processes in hazard management.

### Effective Use of Graphic Organisers

The effectiveness of graphic organisers depends on thoughtful implementation. Research suggests several principles for effective use:

**Match organiser to thinking task**: Different organisers support different types of thinking. Teachers should select organisers that match the cognitive demands of the learning objective, explicitly teaching students when and why to use particular formats.

**Graduated release of responsibility**: Initially, teachers should provide completed organisers as models, then partially completed organisers requiring students to fill gaps, and finally blank organisers that students complete independently. This gradual release supports the development of independent learning skills.

**Integration with discussion**: Graphic organisers are most effective when used as the basis for classroom discussion. Students should compare their organisers, identify differences in how they have structured information, and discuss the implications of different organisational choices.

**Connection to writing**: Graphic organisers should not exist in isolation but should feed directly into extended writing. Teachers should explicitly model how to translate the structured information in an organiser into coherent prose, addressing common challenges such as integrating evidence and developing analytical commentary.

## Knowledge Organisers: Consolidating Geographical Knowledge

Knowledge organisers have emerged as a widely adopted tool for consolidating and revisiting geographical knowledge. These single-page documents present the core knowledge for a topic in a structured, accessible format, designed to support retrieval practice and long-term retention.

### Design Principles for Geography Knowledge Organisers

Effective knowledge organisers in geography share several design characteristics:

**Visual hierarchy**: Information is organised to emphasise the most important concepts, using headings, colour-coding, and spatial arrangement to guide attention.

**Dual coding**: The most effective organisers combine verbal information with visual representations—maps, diagrams, images—that support memory through multiple encoding channels (Paivio, 1986).

**Concision**: Knowledge organisers should present essential information without overwhelming detail. The constraint of a single page forces decisions about what is truly core knowledge.

**Retrieval-friendly formatting**: Organisers should be designed with retrieval practice in mind, potentially including blank versions that students complete from memory or using the organiser as a reference for self-testing.

### Retrieval Practice and Knowledge Organisers

The implementation of knowledge organisers connects to broader evidence-based practice around retrieval practice—the active process of recalling information from memory, which strengthens retention more effectively than passive review. Geography teachers use knowledge organisers as the basis for retrieval activities including:

**Low-stakes quizzing**: Regular quizzes drawing on knowledge organiser content, with feedback that corrects misconceptions and fills gaps.

**Self-testing**: Students use blank or partially completed organisers to test themselves, checking their recall against the complete version.

**Spaced practice**: Knowledge organiser content is revisited at increasing intervals, countering the forgetting curve and supporting long-term retention.

The integration of knowledge organisers with thinking skills approaches represents an important synthesis in geography pedagogy. While knowledge organisers support the retention of geographical information, thinking skills strategies develop the capacity to use that information analytically. Both are necessary: students cannot think geographically without geographical knowledge, and knowledge without the capacity for analysisGEOEOF
