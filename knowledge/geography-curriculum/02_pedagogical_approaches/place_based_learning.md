Place-based learning represents one of the most powerful pedagogical approaches in geography education, connecting pupils' lived experiences with the broader geographical concepts that shape their understanding of the world. This knowledge file explores the theoretical foundations, practical implementation, and pedagogical strategies for effective place-based learning and case study pedagogy across all key stages.

---

## 1. Defining Place-Based Learning in Geography Education

### 1.1 Theoretical Foundations

Place-based learning (PBL), sometimes referred to as place-based education, grounds teaching and learning in the local environment, using pupils' immediate surroundings as the starting point for geographical enquiry. As Rawling (2008) observes, "Geographers do not just see a place as an 'objective thing' in the world that can be described and explained as they build up geographical knowledge. 'Place' is also experienced on a personal and deeply emotional level."

The approach draws on several theoretical traditions:

- **Phenomenology** – emphasising lived experience and subjective encounter with place
- **Critical geography** – questioning power relations and whose stories are told about places
- **Environmental education** – fostering connections between people and their environments
- **Experiential learning** – learning through direct engagement and reflection (Kolb, 1984)

Beames et al. (2023) argue that place-based pedagogy fosters a "deep sense of belonging and place" while strengthening interdisciplinary understanding. This is particularly relevant when connecting geography with history, as both subjects share an interest in how human societies interact with their environments over time.

### 1.2 Distinction from Traditional Approaches

Traditional geography teaching often moved from the familiar to the unfamiliar—starting with local studies before expanding to regional, national, and global scales. While this progression has merit, place-based learning is more than simply teaching about nearby locations. It involves:

- **Embodied engagement** – learning through physical presence and sensory experience
- **Relational thinking** – understanding how the local connects to wider processes and patterns
- **Critical questioning** – examining how places are represented, by whom, and for what purposes
- **Agency and action** – empowering pupils to engage with and potentially improve their local environments

The Geographical Association (GA) emphasises that place-based learning should help pupils explore their own perceptions, meanings, and experiences of place, focusing on how places are represented, experienced, and imagined.

## 2. The Rationale for Place-Based Learning

### 2.1 Ofsted and Curriculum Priorities

The Ofsted research review series for geography (2021) highlights that "pupils' place knowledge is particularly strengthened by studying case studies." The review notes that drawing on different perspectives helps pupils deepen their appreciation of locations and their people, cultures, and environmental conditions.

Place-based learning aligns closely with the three pillars of Ofsted's inspection framework:

| Intent | Implementation | Impact |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Clear rationale for what pupils should know about places | Varied teaching approaches that connect local to global | Pupils develop nuanced understanding of place complexity |
| Sequenced curriculum building place knowledge over time | Use of fieldwork, primary sources, and diverse representations | Pupils can apply geographical thinking to new contexts |
| Inclusive curriculum representing diverse places and perspectives | Critical examination of how places are portrayed | Pupils demonstrate responsible attitudes toward places |

### 2.2 Cognitive and Affective Benefits

Research demonstrates multiple benefits of place-based approaches:

**Cognitive Benefits:**
- Enhanced knowledge retention through contextualised learning
- Development of spatial thinking and mental mapping skills
- Integration of substantive and disciplinary knowledge
- Application of geographical concepts to real-world contexts

**Affective Benefits:**
- Increased motivation and engagement through relevance
- Development of environmental stewardship and responsibility
- Cultivation of empathy for people in different places
- Building of identity and belonging (particularly important for disadvantaged pupils)

### 2.3 Social Justice and Inclusion

Place-based learning can address equity concerns by:
- Validating pupils' own geographical experiences and knowledge
- Providing accessible entry points for pupils with limited travel experiences
- Challenging stereotypes about places and their inhabitants
- Creating opportunities for community engagement and agency

As Biddulph (2010) reminds us, we must ask: "Whose places are included in and excluded from the geography we teach?" This question is central to ensuring place-based learning is genuinely inclusive rather than merely reinforcing dominant narratives.

## 3. Implementing Place-Based Learning Across Key Stages

### 3.1 Early Years and Key Stage 1

At this stage, place-based learning focuses on:

**The Immediate Environment:**
- The classroom and school building
- The school grounds and immediate locality
- Routes to school and familiar journeys

**Pedagogical Approaches:**
- Sensory exploration and mapping
- Simple fieldwork using all senses
- Talking about places through stories and photographs
- Creating simple plans and maps

The EYFS framework emphasises "Understanding the World," which includes guiding children to make sense of their physical world and community. Teachers should provide opportunities for children to:
- Explore the natural world around them
- Recognise features of their immediate environment
- Begin to understand similarities and differences between places

### 3.2 Key Stage 2

Place-based learning in KS2 expands pupils' geographical horizons while maintaining strong local connections:

**Progression in Scale:**
- Local area studies in depth
- Comparative studies with another UK locality
- Studies of contrasting overseas localities

**Key Pedagogical Strategies:**
- Extended local area fieldwork with increasing independence
- Use of digital mapping tools (e.g., Digimap for Schools)
- Data collection and presentation about the local area
- Exploring how the local area has changed over time

The National Curriculum requires pupils to "understand geographical similarities and differences through studying the human and physical geography of a region of the United Kingdom, a region in a European country, and a region within North or South America." Place-based approaches make these comparisons meaningful by grounding them in concrete experience.

### 3.3 Key Stage 3

At KS3, place-based learning becomes more sophisticated:

**Deepening Complexity:**
- Critical examination of how places are represented
- Understanding the dynamic nature of place
- Exploring interconnections between local and global processes
- Investigating contested and changing places

**Pedagogical Approaches:**
- Extended enquiry projects on local issues
- Use of diverse sources including literary, artistic, and multimedia representations
- Analysis of data about the local area (census, economic, environmental)
- Fieldwork that goes beyond description to analysis and evaluation

The GA recommends that teachers ensure "pupils learn about places in an appropriately nuanced and complex way. They should encounter the same places at different times and in different contexts, or look at a place through a range of geographical lenses."

### 3.4 Key Stage 4 and 5

At GCSE and A Level, place-based learning underpins case study work and fieldwork requirements:

**GCSE Requirements:**
- Specific place case studies for physical and human topics
- Fieldwork in contrasting environments
- Use of specific examples to illustrate processes and patterns

**A Level Requirements:**
- In-depth study of places at different scales
- Independent investigation based on fieldwork
- Critical engagement with geographical theory through specific places

All major exam boards (AQA, Edexcel, OCR, Eduqas) require detailed case studies. Place-based learning provides the foundation for pupils to engage with these requirements meaningfully.

## 4. Case Study Pedagogy

### 4.1 The Role of Case Studies in Geography

Case studies are the building blocks of geographical understanding. The Ofsted research review (2021) states: "This is the point at which the concept being explored becomes 'real'."

Effective case study pedagogy involves:
- **Specificity** – named places, specific data, concrete examples
- **Depth** – detailed knowledge that goes beyond superficial description
- **Contextualisation** – understanding the broader geographical context
- **Multiple perspectives** – recognising different viewpoints about places

### 4.2 The Three Lamps Model

Freeman and Morgan (2017) propose a valuable framework for planning place studies: the "three lamps" model. This approach ensures pupils encounter places through multiple lenses:

**Lamp 1: The Natural Science/Positivist Perspective**
- Location and physical setting
- Climate and weather patterns
- Geomorphology and landscape features
- Environmental challenges and opportunities

**Lamp 2: The Social Science Perspective**
- Economic development and activity
- Social structures and inequalities
- Historical processes shaping the place
- Political systems and governance
- Global connections and interdependencies

**Lamp 3: The Humanistic/Lived Experience Perspective**
- How people experience and represent the place
- Cultural meanings and identities
- Emotional and affective dimensions
- Personal stories and testimonies
- Arts, literature, and media representations

This model helps teachers ensure that case studies are not merely descriptive but explore the complexity and contested nature of place.

### 4.3 Selecting and Using Case Studies

Ofsted (2021) recommends that teachers "go to primary sources to ensure accuracy and currency of case studies." This ensures:

- **Authenticity** – the representation is accurate and not stereotyped
- **Currency** – information is up-to-date and reflects current conditions
- **Depth** – sources provide sufficient detail for meaningful analysis
- **Multiple voices** – different perspectives are represented

**Strategies for Effective Case Study Teaching:**

| Strategy | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Layering | Building knowledge of a place across multiple lessons | Studying Mumbai through population, economic activity, urban challenges, and sustainability |
| Comparison | Juxtaposing different places to highlight patterns and variations | Comparing coastal management in the UK and Jamaica |
| Revisiting | Returning to the same place through different topics | Investigating Brazil through rainforest, development, and urban units |
| Pupil research | Independent investigation of specific examples | GCSE fieldwork investigations |

### 4.4 Avoiding Common Pitfalls

**Superficial Coverage:**
Case studies that lack depth—providing only basic facts without analysis—limit geographical understanding. Teachers should ensure sufficient time is allocated for pupils to develop detailed knowledge.

**Static Representation:**
Places are dynamic, yet case studies often present them as unchanging. Effective pedagogy emphasises change over time and ongoing processes.

**Single Perspectives:**
Presenting only one view of a place reinforces stereotypes. The three lamps model helps ensure multiple perspectives are included.

**Disconnect from Concepts:**
Case studies should illuminate geographical concepts and theories. Without this connection, they become isolated facts rather than integrated knowledge.

## 5. Practical Strategies for Place-Based Learning

### 5.1 Fieldwork as Pedagogy

Fieldwork is the cornerstone of place-based learning. The National Curriculum requires it at all key stages, and it is examined at GCSE and A Level.

**Types of Fieldwork:**

| Type | Description | Suitable For |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Sensory walks | Exploring through sight, sound, touch, smell | EYFS and KS1 |
| Neighbourhood mapping | Creating maps of the local area | KS1 and KS2 |
| Environmental surveys | Assessing quality, litter, biodiversity | KS2 and KS3 |
| Data collection | Questionnaires, traffic counts, land use surveys | KS3, GCSE, A Level |
| Independent investigations | Student-designed enquiries | GCSE and A Level |

**Fieldwork Principles:**
- Build on pupils' existing knowledge and questions
- Progress from teacher-led to increasingly independent
- Integrate fieldwork with classroom learning
- Ensure fieldwork addresses genuine geographical questions
- Reflect on the experience and learning

### 5.2 Using Primary Sources

Primary sources bring places to life and develop pupils' skills in interpretation:

**Types of Primary Sources:**
- Photographs (historical and contemporary)
- Maps (including old maps showing change over time)
- Artefacts and objects
- Oral histories and interviews
- Data (census, environmental monitoring)
- Creative representations (art, literature, music)

**Pedagogical Approaches:**
- Start with open-ended observation before providing context
- Compare multiple sources representing the same place
- Encourage pupils to question sources (who made this? why? for whom?)
- Connect sources to pupils' own experiences and questions

### 5.3 Digital Technologies

Digital tools expand the possibilities for place-based learning:

**Mapping and GIS:**
- Digimap for Schools (Ordnance Survey maps)
- Google Earth and Google Maps
- GIS software (ArcGIS Online, QGIS)
- Virtual field trips and 360° imagery

**Data Collection and Analysis:**
- Mobile apps for fieldwork data
- Online survey tools
- Data visualisation platforms
- Social media and geotagged content

**Virtual and Augmented Reality:**
- Virtual fieldwork to inaccessible places
- Overlaying historical maps onto current views
- Simulating environmental processes

The GA advises that technology should enhance rather than replace direct experience of place where possible.

### 5.4 Community Engagement

Connecting with the local community deepens place-based learning:

**Strategies:**
- Inviting local experts and elders to speak to pupils
- Partnering with local environmental organisations
- Contributing to community projects (e.g., conservation, planning)
- Investigating local issues and presenting findings to decision-makers
- Exploring local heritage and history

At York St John University, for example, student teachers engage with local heritage sites like York Minster and Roman Eboracum, connecting physical geography with historical enquiry (Jach & Huntsley, 2025).

## 6. Progression in Place-Based Learning

### 6.1 Developing Geographical Thinking

Progression in place-based learning involves increasingly sophisticated geographical thinking:

**Early Years and KS1:**
- Recognising and naming features
- Describing immediate surroundings
- Simple comparisons

**KS2:**
- Explaining features and patterns
- Understanding processes
- Making connections between human and physical geography

**KS3:**
- Analysing interactions and interconnections
- Evaluating representations and perspectives
- Understanding dynamic and contested nature of place

**KS4 and 5:**
- Synthesising complex information
- Theorising and applying geographical models
- Independent investigation and critical analysis

### 6.2 Building Knowledge Over Time

The curriculum should be designed so that pupils encounter places in increasingly sophisticated ways:

**Spiral Curriculum Example – The Local Area:**
- **KS1:** Mapping the school grounds; sensory exploration
- **KS2:** Detailed local study; comparing with another UK locality
- **KS3:** Critical analysis of local changes; connections to global processes
- **KS4:** Fieldwork investigation of a local geographical issue
- **KS5:** Independent investigation potentially focused on the local area

### 6.3 Developing Sense of Place

A key aim of place-based learning is developing pupils' "sense of place"—their emotional and cognitive connection to locations. This involves:

- **Caring about places** – developing stewardship and responsibility
- **Understanding places** – knowing their characteristics, processes, and issues
- **Critically engaging with places** – questioning representations and power relations
- **Acting for places** – contributing positively to local environments

---

## 7. Assessment of Place-Based Learning

### 7.1 Assessing Place Knowledge

Assessment should evaluate:
- Recall of specific information about places
- Understanding of geographical processes in context
- Ability to apply knowledge to new situations
- Recognition of multiple perspectives and representations

### 7.2 Assessing Fieldwork Skills

Fieldwork assessment should evaluate:
- Planning and risk assessment
- Data collection methods and accuracy
- Data presentation and analysis
- Drawing conclusions and evaluation

### 7.3 Assessing Sense of Place

While more challenging to assess, indicators might include:
- Quality of engagement in fieldwork
- Depth of reflection on place experiences
- Ability to articulate personal connections to place
- Evidence of responsible attitudes and behaviours

---

## 8. Common Misconceptions and How to Address Them

### 8.1 Misconceptions About Places

Pupils often hold stereotyped views of places, particularly distant or unfamiliar ones. Common misconceptions include:
- Viewing Africa as a single, undifferentiated place
- Assuming all people in a country share the same experiences
- Believing rural areas are unchanging while cities are dynamic
- Thinking physical environments determine human outcomes in simple ways

**Addressing Misconceptions:**
- Use specific, detailed case studies rather than generalisations
- Include diverse representations of places
- Challenge stereotypes explicitly
- Use comparison to highlight complexity and variation

### 8.2 Misconceptions About Fieldwork

Pupils may see fieldwork as:
- A day out rather than serious learning
- About collecting data without analysis
- Unconnected to classroom geography

**Addressing Misconceptions:**
- Ensure clear learning objectives for fieldwork
- Integrate fieldwork into sequences of lessons
- Emphasise the geographical questions being investigated
- Build reflection and analysis into fieldwork activities

## 11. Extended Discussion: The Pedagogical Dimensions of Place

### 11.1 Place as Relational and Dynamic

A sophisticated understanding of place recognises that places are not static containers but dynamic, relational constructs. Massey (1993) describes places as "open, porous, and constantly being made through their connections with other places." This has profound implications for geography pedagogy:

**Teaching Implications:**
- Pupils should understand that places change over multiple timescales
- The local is always connected to wider regional, national, and global processes
- Places are experienced differently by different people
- Representation of place is always partial and selective

For example, when teaching about a coastal town in the UK, effective place-based learning would explore not just its physical geography but also how it is connected to global tourism markets, how its economy has shifted from fishing to services, and how different residents (young people, retirees, business owners) experience the place differently.

### 11.2 The Politics of Place Representation

Geography educators have a responsibility to teach critically about how places are represented. Media representations often flatten complex places into stereotypes:

- The "Global South" represented only through poverty and disaster
- Rural areas depicted as unchanging and traditional
- Cities portrayed as either exciting hubs or dangerous spaces

Teachers should:
- Use multiple representations of the same place
- Question who created representations and for what purposes
- Include voices from within places, not just external commentary
- Discuss how representations shape how we think about places and their inhabitants

### 11.3 Place-Based Learning and Sustainability

Place-based learning is particularly powerful for teaching about sustainability and environmental issues. When pupils understand the specific environmental challenges facing their own locality, abstract concepts become concrete:

**Local Environmental Issues:**
- Flooding and drainage in the local area
- Air quality and pollution sources
- Urban heat islands in the school locality
- Habitat loss and conservation efforts
- Waste management and recycling infrastructure

By investigating these issues first-hand, pupils develop both understanding and agency. They can see the effects of environmental processes, understand local decision-making, and potentially contribute to solutions.

### 11.4 Place-Based Learning for Cultural Understanding

Place-based learning supports the development of cultural understanding in several ways:

**Understanding Diversity Within Places:**
- Exploring the different communities within the local area
- Investigating how migration has shaped the locality
- Understanding how cultural practices vary within the same place
- Recognising that no place is culturally homogeneous

**Developing Empathy:**
- Hearing personal stories from community members
- Understanding how places are experienced differently
- Exploring historical experiences of place
- Considering future scenarios for places

---

## 14. Professional Development for Teachers

### 14.1 Developing Subject Knowledge

Teachers need strong subject knowledge to teach place-based learning effectively:

**Areas for Development:**
- Local area knowledge – history, geography, current issues
- Understanding of geographical concepts and their application to the local
- Knowledge of fieldwork techniques and safety procedures
- Familiarity with digital mapping and GIS tools

### 14.2 Collaborative Planning

Place-based learning benefits from collaboration:

- Working with colleagues across key stages to ensure progression
- Partnering with local organisations and experts
- Connecting with other schools in the area
- Sharing resources and approaches within the department

### 14.3 Reflective Practice

Teachers should regularly reflect on their place-based teaching:

- What worked well in this unit?
- How did pupils respond to the local focus?
- What would I do differently next time?
- How can I make connections clearer?

---

## 15. Conclusion: The Power of Place

Place-based learning is more than a pedagogical strategy – it is a fundamental approach to geography education that recognises the importance of embodied, situated learning. By grounding geographical education in pupils' lived experience of place, teachers can:

- Make abstract concepts concrete and meaningful
- Develop pupils' sense of identity and belonging
- Foster environmental stewardship and responsible citizenship
- Challenge stereotypes and develop critical thinking
- Build knowledge progressively from the local to the global

The Ofsted research review reminds us that "pupils' place knowledge is particularly strengthened by studying case studies" and that this is "the point at which the concept being explored becomes 'real'." By embracing place-based learning and case study pedagogy, geography teachers ensure that their subject remains relevant, engaging, and intellectually rigorous.

As Rawlings Smith and Pike (2023) conclude, place matters in geography teaching. It matters because it connects pupils to their world, develops their geographical imagination, and prepares them to engage critically and responsibly with the places they will inhabit throughout their lives.
