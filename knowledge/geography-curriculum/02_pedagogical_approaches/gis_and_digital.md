# GIS and Digital Technologies in Geography Education

## Introduction: The Digital Imperative in Geography

The integration of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and digital technologies into geography education represents one of the most significant pedagogical shifts in the subject's recent history. Since the 2013 National Curriculum made explicit reference to GIS as a required element of geographical study, teachers have faced the challenge of embedding sophisticated digital tools into their practice whilst maintaining focus on core geographical concepts and inquiry.

The rationale for this integration extends beyond mere curriculum compliance. In an era of big data, location-based services, and spatial analysis, digital geospatial literacy has become as fundamental to geographical understanding as map-reading was to previous generations. The Royal Geographical Society (with IBG) and the Geographical Association have consistently advocated for GIS education, recognising that these technologies enable students to engage with authentic geographical questions using real-world data.

This knowledge file examines the theoretical foundations, practical applications, and pedagogical strategies for teaching GIS and digital technologies across key stages, drawing on national curriculum requirements, examination board specifications, and established best practice from the geography education community.

## What is GIS? Core Concepts and Capabilities

### Defining Geographical Information Systems

A Geographical Information System (GIS) is a computer-based system for capturing, storing, checking, integrating, manipulating, analysing, and displaying data related to positions on the Earth's surface. Unlike static maps, GIS allows users to overlay multiple data layers, query spatial relationships, and visualise complex patterns that would be impossible to discern from conventional cartographic representations.

The DfE (2013) National Curriculum requires pupils to "interpret a range of sources of geographical information, including maps, diagrams, globes, aerial photographs and Geographical Information Systems." This statutory requirement positions GIS not as an optional enrichment activity but as a fundamental component of geographical literacy.

### Key GIS Capabilities for Educational Contexts

For teaching purposes, GIS functionality can be understood through several core capabilities that align with geographical learning objectives:

**Data Visualisation and Thematic Mapping**: GIS enables the creation of choropleth maps, proportional symbol maps, and heat maps that transform raw data into visually compelling geographical narratives. This supports students in identifying spatial patterns and relationships.

**Layering and Overlay Analysis**: The ability to superimpose multiple data layers—such as population density, land use, and transport networks—facilitates understanding of geographical interconnections and complex causation.

**Query and Selection Tools**: Students can interrogate data by attribute (e.g., selecting all areas with population density above 500 persons per hectare) or by spatial relationship (e.g., selecting all features within 500 metres of a river).

**Measurement and Calculation**: GIS provides tools for measuring distances, areas, and elevations, supporting quantitative geographical investigation and mathematical application.

**Data Capture and Fieldwork Integration**: Mobile GIS applications enable students to collect primary data in the field using GPS coordinates, photographs, and attribute information, creating seamless connections between classroom and outdoor learning.

## GIS Platforms and Tools for Schools

### Digimap for Schools

Digimap for Schools, developed by EDINA in partnership with Ordnance Survey, represents the most widely adopted GIS platform in UK schools. This award-winning service provides interactive access to OS mapping at multiple scales, historical maps, and aerial imagery through an intuitive web-based interface.

The platform's educational value lies in its accessibility for younger learners whilst maintaining sophisticated functionality for advanced study. Primary pupils can explore their local area using simple pan and zoom tools, whilst A Level students can conduct complex spatial analysis using measurement tools and layer comparisons. Ordnance Survey (2024) has expanded free access to schools in deprived areas, addressing equity concerns in digital geography provision.

Digimap for Schools supports cross-curricular applications, with resources for mathematics (scale and measurement), history (historical map sequences), and literacy (descriptive writing about places). The platform's annotation tools enable teachers and students to create customised maps for specific enquiries, adding markers, lines, polygons, and text overlays.

### ArcGIS Online for Schools

Esri UK's ArcGIS Online for Schools programme provides free access to professional-grade GIS software for all UK educational institutions. This cloud-based platform offers more sophisticated analytical capabilities than Digimap, including advanced symbology, spatial analysis tools, and the creation of interactive web maps and StoryMaps.

The ArcGIS platform enables students to engage with authentic data sets from sources including the Office for National Statistics, Environment Agency, and Met Office. This exposure to real-world data supports development of data literacy skills alongside geographical understanding. The platform's StoryMaps feature has particular pedagogical value, allowing students to combine interactive maps with narrative text, images, and multimedia to communicate geographical findings.

Esri UK provides extensive teaching resources through its Teach with GIS hub, including GeoInquiries—pre-built inquiry activities aligned to curriculum topics that guide students through structured investigations using ArcGIS tools.

### Google Earth and Google My Maps

Google Earth Pro and Google My Maps offer accessible entry points to GIS concepts, particularly for primary and lower secondary settings. Google Earth's immersive 3D visualisation and historical imagery timeline support engagement with place knowledge and landscape change. My Maps enables basic data layer creation and collaborative mapping projects without requiring specialist software installation.

Whilst these tools lack the analytical sophistication of professional GIS platforms, they serve important scaffolding functions, introducing younger students to concepts of layers, attributes, and spatial scale before progression to more complex systems.

### Mobile GIS and Fieldwork Applications

The proliferation of smartphones and tablets has democratised data collection in geographical fieldwork. Applications such as Survey123, Collector for ArcGIS, and free alternatives like Epicollect5 enable students to gather geo-located primary data during field enquiries. These tools support:

- GPS tracking of fieldwork routes
- Photography geotagged to specific locations
- Structured data entry through customisable forms
- Real-time data visualisation during collection
- Synchronisation with classroom GIS platforms for analysis

The integration of mobile GIS transforms fieldwork from a purely observational activity into a data-rich enquiry process, allowing students to collect, visualise, and analyse information within a single field session.

## Pedagogical Approaches for Teaching GIS

### Scaffolding Digital Skills Development

Effective GIS pedagogy requires careful attention to cognitive load, particularly when students are simultaneously learning new technological skills and complex geographical content. Teachers should employ explicit scaffolding strategies:

**Technical Scaffolding**: Begin with simplified interfaces and limited functionality, gradually introducing additional tools as student confidence develops. Pre-prepared map files with relevant data layers already loaded reduce initial barriers to engagement.

**Conceptual Scaffolding**: Ensure students understand the geographical concepts being explored before introducing digital tools. A student who struggles to interpret a paper choropleth map will not benefit from attempting the same task in GIS without foundational understanding.

**Procedural Scaffolding**: Provide step-by-step guides, video tutorials, or peer support systems for technical procedures. The goal is to make GIS use automatic enough that cognitive resources remain available for geographical thinking.

### Inquiry-Based Learning with GIS

GIS platforms are inherently suited to inquiry-based pedagogies, supporting the full cycle of geographical investigation:

**Question Formulation**: Students can explore data patterns to generate enquiry questions. For example, overlaying deprivation indices with air quality data might lead to questions about environmental justice.

**Data Collection**: Mobile GIS enables primary data gathering; web-based platforms provide access to secondary data sets. The authenticity of real data enhances engagement and supports development of data literacy.

**Analysis and Interpretation**: GIS tools facilitate pattern recognition, hypothesis testing, and the identification of anomalies. Students can test relationships between variables using visual overlay or basic statistical functions.

**Communication**: Digital mapping outputs, StoryMaps, and interactive web maps provide authentic audiences for student work, supporting development of communication skills alongside geographical understanding.

The Geographical Association's enquiry-based learning framework emphasises that GIS should serve geographical thinking rather than becoming an end in itself. Effective lessons maintain focus on "the geography" whilst using digital tools to enhance investigation.

### Differentiation and Accessibility

GIS activities require careful differentiation to ensure accessibility for all learners:

**By Task Complexity**: Provide tiered tasks where all students work with the same data but with varying levels of analytical demand. Lower-attaining students might identify basic patterns; higher-attaining students analyse relationships and evaluate reliability.

**By Support Provision**: Offer differentiated levels of technical support, from fully guided step-by-step instructions for students with additional needs to open-ended challenges for confident digital learners.

**By Output Format**: Accept multiple forms of evidence of learning—annotated screenshots, oral presentations, written analysis, or interactive maps—recognising that technical barriers should not prevent demonstration of geographical understanding.

**By Platform Selection**: Match GIS platforms to student needs. Digimap's simplicity suits many learners; ArcGIS sophistication supports advanced study. Both represent valid routes to geographical learning.

## Progression Across Key Stages

### Key Stage 1 and 2 (Ages 5-11)

At primary level, GIS education focuses on foundational digital mapping skills and spatial awareness. The National Curriculum requires pupils to use "aerial photographs and plan perspectives to recognise landmarks and basic human and physical features" and to "use simple compass directions and locational and directional language."

Appropriate GIS activities for this phase include:

- Exploring the local area using Digimap for Schools at large scale
- Creating simple digital maps with annotated markers showing significant locations
- Comparing aerial photographs with map representations of the same area
- Using measurement tools to compare distances between familiar places
- Creating basic StoryMaps combining maps with photographs and descriptions

The emphasis should be on playful exploration and developing familiarity with digital interfaces rather than complex analysis. Teachers should make explicit connections between digital and paper maps, ensuring students develop transferable mapping skills.

### Key Stage 3 (Ages 11-14)

The KS3 National Curriculum explicitly requires students to "use Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to view, analyse and interpret places and data." This statutory requirement represents a significant step up from the implicit digital expectations at primary level.

Appropriate progression at KS3 includes:

- Systematic use of OS maps at multiple scales through Digimap for Schools
- Introduction to thematic mapping and data visualisation principles
- Layering multiple data sets to explore geographical relationships
- Using GIS to support place knowledge acquisition through virtual exploration
- Beginning to collect and map primary data from fieldwork enquiries
- Creating interactive maps and StoryMaps to communicate findings

The Ofsted research review (2021) emphasises that substantive geographical knowledge and disciplinary skills should develop in tandem. GIS activities at KS3 should strengthen both dimensions—building knowledge of places and processes whilst developing proficiency in digital geographical practice.

### GCSE (Key Stage 4, Ages 14-16)

All GCSE Geography specifications require the use of GIS, though the extent and nature of requirements varies between boards. Typically, students are expected to:

- Use GIS to identify and illustrate patterns in geographical data
- Analyse spatial data to support enquiry-based investigations
- Evaluate the strengths and limitations of GIS as a geographical tool
- Integrate GIS with fieldwork data collection and analysis

ArcGIS Online becomes increasingly appropriate at this level, supporting more sophisticated analysis and the integration of diverse data sets. The NEA (Non-Examined Assessment) component in many specifications provides opportunities for extended GIS-supported investigations where students can demonstrate independent application of digital skills.

Fieldwork requirements at GCSE increasingly expect digital data capture and analysis. Students should be proficient in using mobile GIS for primary data collection and in processing, visualising, and interpreting this data alongside secondary sources.

### A Level (Key Stage 5, Ages 16-18)

A Level Geography specifications expect sophisticated use of GIS as an integral component of geographical enquiry. Requirements typically include:

- Independent use of GIS for research and investigation
- Critical evaluation of GIS methodologies, including accuracy, reliability, and ethical considerations
- Integration of GIS with statistical analysis and qualitative methods
- Application of GIS to complex geographical debates and contemporary issues

The independent investigation (NEA) provides substantial scope for GIS application, with many students choosing topics that require spatial analysis—urban microclimates, deprivation patterns, coastal management, or changing retail landscapes. Teachers should support students in developing autonomous GIS capabilities, recognising that these skills are increasingly valued in higher education and employment.

At this level, students should engage with the limitations as well as the capabilities of GIS. Critical consideration of data quality, scale effects, representational choices, and ethical implications of spatial data represents advanced disciplinary thinking.

## Integrating GIS with Fieldwork

### The Digital-Fieldwork Continuum

The relationship between GIS and fieldwork is symbiotic. Fieldwork generates the primary data that gives GIS applications authenticity; GIS provides the analytical tools that transform field observations into geographical insight. Effective curriculum design creates coherent journeys between outdoor data collection and digital analysis.

The Geographical Association advocates for "technology-enabled fieldwork" that enhances rather than replaces direct engagement with places. Mobile GIS applications allow immediate data visualisation in the field, enabling students to refine their enquiries based on emerging patterns.

### Mobile Data Capture Strategies

Successful fieldwork using mobile GIS requires careful planning:

**Pre-Fieldwork Preparation**: Students should understand the enquiry context and data requirements before fieldwork. Pre-loading maps and data collection forms onto devices ensures efficient use of limited field time.

**Structured Data Collection**: Mobile forms with standardised fields (dropdown menus, multiple choice, constrained text entry) improve data quality compared to free text entry. Students should practise data collection procedures before the fieldwork day.

**Synchronisation and Backup**: Establish clear protocols for data synchronisation and backup. Cloud-based systems should be tested in advance; offline capabilities are essential for locations with poor mobile signal.

**Ethical Considerations**: Students should understand protocols for photographing people and private property. Data protection requirements apply to field-collected information, particularly when shared online.

### From Field to Classroom

The transition from field data collection to classroom analysis requires explicit teaching:

- Data cleaning: identifying and addressing errors, duplicates, or anomalies
- Data integration: combining primary field data with secondary sources
- Visualisation choices: selecting appropriate symbology and classification methods
- Analysis methods: applying appropriate GIS tools to investigate enquiry questions
- Quality assurance: evaluating reliability and identifying sources of uncertainty

This process mirrors professional geographical practice and supports development of authentic disciplinary skills.

## Digital Literacy and Data Skills

### Beyond GIS: Broader Digital Geographies

Whilst GIS forms the core digital technology in geography education, teachers should also address wider digital geographies including:

**Remote Sensing and Satellite Imagery**: Understanding how Earth observation data is captured, processed, and applied to monitoring environmental change, urban growth, and natural hazards.

**Global Positioning Systems (GPS)**: The principles behind location services, accuracy limitations, and applications in navigation, fieldwork, and everyday life.

**Location-Based Services**: Critical examination of how mobile applications use location data, including privacy implications and the commercial exploitation of spatial information.

**Big Data and Geospatial Analytics**: Awareness of how large-scale data sets—mobile phone records, social media check-ins, transaction data—are transforming geographical research and raising ethical questions.

**Virtual and Augmented Reality**: Emerging technologies for immersive place exploration, though their educational application remains developing.

### Data Literacy Across the Curriculum

Geography makes a distinctive contribution to whole-school data literacy. GIS activities develop capabilities that transfer across subjects:

- **Numerical reasoning**: Working with ratios, percentages, and statistical measures in real contexts
- **Data visualisation**: Understanding principles of effective graphical communication
- **Critical evaluation**: Assessing data quality, sources, and representational choices
- **Digital citizenship**: Understanding privacy, surveillance, and ethical dimensions of location data

The Royal Geographical Society (with IBG) and the Geographical Association have highlighted geography's role in developing "data skills for the modern world," positioning the subject as essential preparation for data-rich futures.

## Common Misconceptions and Challenges

### Student Misconceptions

Research by Healy and Walshe (2019) identified several common misconceptions students hold about GIS:

**Technology-Determinism**: Some students view GIS output as objective truth, failing to recognise that maps are constructed representations subject to human decisions about data selection, classification, and symbolisation.

**Scale Confusion**: Students frequently struggle to maintain awareness of scale when zooming between different map extents, leading to misinterpretation of patterns and densities.

**Layer Misunderstanding**: The concept of data layers, fundamental to GIS functionality, is not always intuitive. Students may fail to understand that layers can be independently manipulated and analysed.

**Attribute vs. Spatial Data**: Distinguishing between the locational component of data (where) and its attributes (what) requires explicit teaching, particularly when students encounter data tables.

**Technology Anxiety**: Some students, particularly those with limited digital experience outside school, may exhibit anxiety about using GIS platforms, fearing they will "break" the software or produce incorrect outputs.

### Teacher Challenges

Implementing GIS education presents significant challenges for teachers:

**Technical Confidence**: Many geography teachers received minimal GIS training during their own education and may lack confidence in using sophisticated digital platforms.

**Time and Curriculum Pressure**: The demands of content-heavy specifications can marginalise skills development. GIS activities require lesson time that might otherwise address substantive content.

**Resource Access**: Whilst Digimap and ArcGIS Online are free to schools, reliable internet connectivity, adequate hardware, and technical support are not universally available.

**Assessment Tensions**: High-stakes examinations may not adequately recognise GIS skills, creating misalignment between curriculum aspirations and assessment realities.

**Keeping Current**: Rapid technological change means that GIS platforms and capabilities evolve continuously. Teachers must commit to ongoing professional learning to maintain currency.

### Addressing the Challenges

Professional development is essential for building teacher confidence. The Geographical Association, Royal Geographical Society, and Esri UK all provide training programmes, online resources, and communities of practice supporting GIS pedagogy. Collaborative planning within departments can distribute expertise and reduce individual preparation burden.

Starting with simple applications and building complexity over time allows both teachers and students to develop confidence progressively. Pre-prepared resources—template maps, data sets, step-by-step guides—reduce technical barriers while teachers develop their own
