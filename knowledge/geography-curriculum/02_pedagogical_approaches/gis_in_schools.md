# GIS in Schools: Teaching Digital Geography

## Introduction

**Geographical Information Systems (GIS)** have transformed how geographers collect, analyse, and present spatial data. In education, GIS offers powerful tools for developing students' spatial thinking, enabling sophisticated geographical enquiry, and preparing learners for a world in which digital spatial information is ubiquitous. This document provides guidance on integrating GIS into school geography across Key Stages 3-5.

## What is GIS?

### Definition and Capabilities

A Geographical Information System is a computer system for:
- Capturing, storing, and managing spatial data
- Analysing relationships, patterns, and trends in geographical information
- Visualising data through maps and other graphical outputs
- Querying and exploring geographical datasets

### Educational Benefits

GIS supports geographical learning by:
- Enabling analysis of large, complex datasets
- Visualising spatial patterns and relationships
- Supporting hypothesis testing and enquiry
- Developing digital literacy alongside geographical understanding
- Preparing students for further study and employment

## Curriculum Requirements

### National Curriculum

The 2014 National Curriculum for geography requires pupils to:
- Use Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to view, analyse and interpret places and data
- Interpret a range of sources of geographical information, including maps, diagrams, globes, aerial photographs and Geographical Information Systems (GIS)

### GCSE Specifications

All major GCSE specifications include GIS requirements:
- Using GIS to present and analyse geographical data
- Interpreting GIS outputs in examination questions
- Some specifications assess GIS skills directly

### A Level Specifications

A Level geography requires more sophisticated GIS use:
- Independent use of GIS for investigation
- Complex data manipulation and analysis
- Critical evaluation of GIS outputs and limitations

## Progression in GIS Skills

### Key Stage 3: Foundations

Students should develop:
- Basic map reading in digital formats
- Understanding of layers and data categories
- Simple data interpretation from GIS outputs
- Familiarity with web-based mapping tools

### GCSE: Developing Competence

Students should be able to:
- Create maps using digital tools
- Display and classify data appropriately
- Use GIS to support geographical enquiry
- Interpret and evaluate GIS outputs

### A Level: Independent Application

Students should demonstrate:
- Independent use of GIS software
- Complex data analysis and manipulation
- Integration of GIS into independent investigations
- Critical understanding of GIS capabilities and limitations

## Practical Approaches

### Web-Based GIS Tools

Accessible starting points for schools:
- **Google Earth**: Virtual globe exploration, measuring distances, layers
- **Google My Maps**: Creating simple maps, adding data points
- **ArcGIS Online**: Professional capabilities with educational access
- **Digimap for Schools**: Ordnance Survey data for education

### Classroom Activities

Effective GIS activities include:
- Mapping data collected during fieldwork
- Exploring patterns in census or environmental data
- Comparing different map representations of the same area
- Creating maps to support geographical arguments

### Fieldwork Integration

GIS enhances fieldwork through:
- GPS for accurate location recording
- Mobile data collection apps
- Integration of field data with secondary sources
- Digital presentation of field findings

## Addressing Barriers

### Technical Challenges

Common barriers and solutions:
- **Software complexity**: Start with web-based tools
- **Limited computers**: Use tablet devices or rotation strategies
- **Teacher confidence**: Professional development and peer support
- **Time constraints**: Integrate GIS into existing topics

### Pedagogical Considerations

Ensuring GIS serves geographical learning:
- Focus on geographical questions, not just software skills
- Connect GIS activities to curriculum content
- Ensure progression in both technical and geographical understanding
- Use GIS to develop enquiry, not just demonstrate techniques

## Assessment

### Assessing GIS Learning

Assessment approaches:
- Analysis of GIS outputs in examinations
- Evaluation of maps created by students
- Integration of GIS into coursework and NEA
- Questions assessing understanding of GIS capabilities and limitations

### Quality Indicators

Good GIS work demonstrates:
- Appropriate selection of data and symbology
- Accurate interpretation of spatial patterns
- Critical evaluation of data quality and representation
- Connection to broader geographical understanding

## Future Developments

### Emerging Technologies

Developments shaping future GIS education:
- Mobile and location-aware technologies
- Real-time data feeds and live mapping
- 3D visualisation and virtual reality
- Open data and citizen science
- Artificial intelligence in spatial analysis

### Preparing Students

Developing adaptable capabilities:
- Understanding core principles that transfer across platforms
- Critical evaluation of digital spatial information
- Awareness of ethical dimensions of spatial data
- Skills for independent learning of new tools

## Conclusion

GIS represents both a significant opportunity and a practical challenge for school geography. By developing progressive approaches that build skills over time and ensuring that GIS always serves geographical purposes, educators can prepare students for a world in which digital spatial literacy is increasingly essential.
