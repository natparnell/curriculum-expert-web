# Values and Attitudes in Geography Education

## Introduction: Why Values and Attitudes Matter in Geography

Geography education is inherently value-laden. Unlike subjects that might claim neutrality, geography deals directly with how humans interact with their environment, how resources are distributed unequally across the globe, and how different cultures perceive and use space. As the Geographical Association notes, the geography curriculum is "not value neutral" and requires teachers to employ approaches that help students explore and question their own values and worldviews (Geographical Association, 2024).

Values and attitudes in geography education refer to the beliefs, dispositions, and emotional responses that pupils develop towards places, people, environments, and issues. The Department of Education and Science (1985) identified attitudes and values as one of four key elements of learning in geography, alongside knowledge, understanding, and skills. This affective dimension—relating to feelings, motivations, enthusiasms, and appreciations—remains central to high-quality geography teaching (Geographical Association, 2025).

The Ofsted research review on geography (2021) emphasised that a successful geography curriculum reflects teachers' careful thinking about not just what is taught, but the rationale behind it. This includes consideration of how values are embedded within geographical content and how pupils' attitudes towards the world are shaped through their geographical education. Her Majesty's Inspectors identify three important outcomes of good geography teaching: students having a better sense of place; understanding geographical issues in an informed way; and having a clearer appreciation of the values and views of others (Geographical Association, 2024).

This knowledge file explores the theoretical foundations of values education in geography, examines the types of values and attitudes central to the discipline, and provides practical guidance for teaching these across all key stages.

## Theoretical Foundations: Values Education Through Geography

### The Affective Domain in Geographical Learning

Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives identifies three domains: cognitive (knowledge), psychomotor (skills), and affective (attitudes and values). The affective domain, while sometimes marginalised in high-stakes assessment cultures, is essential to geography education. It encompasses receiving (attending), responding, valuing, organising, and characterising by a value or value complex (Krathwohl, Bloom, and Masia, 1964).

In geography, the affective dimension manifests when pupils develop:
- **Concern** for environmental degradation
- **Empathy** with people in distant places facing challenges
- **Appreciation** of cultural diversity
- **Responsibility** towards sustainable practices
- **Curiosity** about how the world works

The Geographical Association (2025) explicitly connects affective learning to geographical practice, noting that teaching about places and fieldwork can make a significant contribution to emotional and values-based learning.

### Values Clarification and Values Analysis

Two major approaches have dominated values education in geography: values clarification and values analysis.

**Values clarification**, associated with Raths, Harmin, and Simon (1966), assumes that values are personal choices and that education should help students identify and articulate their own values without teacher imposition. This approach emphasises processes for recognising what one values, prizing those values, and acting upon them.

**Values analysis**, by contrast, treats values as objects of study. Students examine the values held by different stakeholders in geographical issues—governments, corporations, local communities, environmental groups—and analyse how these values influence decisions and outcomes. This approach aligns with geography's disciplinary commitment to examining multiple perspectives.

Contemporary geography education increasingly favours a balanced approach that combines both methods: helping students recognise their own values while also subjecting values to critical geographical analysis.

### The Social Realist Perspective

Recent scholarship has applied social realist approaches to knowledge to values education in geography. This perspective argues that while values are socially constructed, they are not arbitrary. Some values—such as respect for human dignity, environmental sustainability, and social justice—can be justified through reasoned argument and geographical evidence (Morgan and Lambert, 2005).

From this perspective, geography teachers have a responsibility not merely to present all values as equally valid, but to help students understand:
- The geographical evidence supporting different value positions
- The consequences of acting on particular values
- The ethical frameworks through which values can be evaluated
- The relationship between values, power, and knowledge

## Types of Values and Attitudes in Geography Education

### Environmental Values

Environmental values concern people's relationships with the natural world. These include:

**Anthropocentric values** place human interests at the centre. Resources are valued for their utility to humans, and environmental protection is justified in terms of human benefit, whether present or future generations.

**Ecocentric values** recognise intrinsic worth in non-human nature. Species, ecosystems, and landscapes have value independent of human use, and human activities should be constrained by ecological limits.

**Technocentric values** emphasise technological solutions to environmental problems. Human ingenuity can overcome resource constraints and environmental damage through innovation, substitution, and management.

Geography education helps students understand these value positions and develop their own informed environmental values. The Geographical Association's guidance on teaching about the environment (2025) encourages exploration of the people-environment relationship, including concepts of stewardship and sustainability, alongside ethical dimensions such as "who gets what, where and why (and why care)?"

### Social and Cultural Values

Geography education promotes values related to human diversity and social organisation:

**Multicultural and anti-racist values** recognise the dignity and equality of all peoples, regardless of cultural background, ethnicity, or nationality. Geography challenges ethnocentrism by revealing the richness of human cultural diversity and examining how racist ideologies have shaped spatial patterns.

**Social justice values** concern fair distribution of resources, opportunities, and power across space. Geography reveals inequalities at local to global scales and examines the processes—colonialism, globalisation, neoliberalism—that produce uneven development.

**Democratic values** include respect for human rights, participation in decision-making, and appreciation of diverse viewpoints. Geography provides case studies of democratic and authoritarian governance and their spatial consequences.

The Geographical Association (2024) notes that geography helps students understand ideas of identity and diversity and "instils values and attitudes for social justice and equality."

### Spatial Values

Less commonly recognised but equally important are values concerning space and place:

**Place attachment** refers to emotional bonds between people and places. These bonds can be positive (love of home landscape) or negative (desire to escape deprived neighbourhoods), and they influence migration decisions, environmental behaviour, and political engagement.

**Scale values** concern whether local, national, or global perspectives should take priority in decision-making. Climate change, for example, requires global cooperation but has local impacts and implementation challenges.

**Distance values** reflect beliefs about proximity and remoteness. Modern communications have challenged traditional assumptions about the significance of physical distance, but geography reveals how distance continues to matter in economic, social, and environmental terms.

## Values and Attitudes Across the Key Stages

### Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS)

In the EYFS, geography is embedded within "Understanding the World." While explicit values education is developmentally inappropriate for very young children, practitioners lay foundations through:

- **Care for the immediate environment**: Tidying up, looking after plants and animals in the setting
- **Appreciation of local place**: Celebrating what makes their locality special
- **Curiosity about distant places**: Stories, images, and artefacts from other cultures presented with respect and wonder
- **Empathy development**: Role-play scenarios that help children imagine other perspectives

Ofsted (2021) found that fieldwork is often strongest in early years settings, where children engage directly with their environment through exploration and play. This early experiential learning establishes emotional connections to place that underpin later values development.

### Key Stage 1 (Ages 5-7)

At Key Stage 1, pupils begin explicit geographical learning about their locality and the wider world. Values education at this stage should:

- **Develop care for the local environment**: Litter picking, improving school grounds, observing seasonal changes
- **Foster curiosity about other places**: Learning about contrasting localities (coastal, rural, urban) without stereotyping
- **Build respect for different ways of life**: Comparing how children live in different parts of the world, focusing on similarities as well as differences
- **Establish safety and risk awareness**: Understanding hazards in the environment and how to stay safe

The national curriculum requires pupils to develop "knowledge about the world, the United Kingdom and their locality" and to use "basic subject-specific vocabulary." Within this, teachers should select content and activities that model and encourage positive values towards places and people.

Common misconceptions at this stage include:
- Assuming all people in Africa live in villages with wild animals
- Believing that hot countries are always poor and cold countries rich
- Thinking that "far away" means "less important"

Teachers must actively challenge these emerging attitudes through careful resource selection and discussion.

### Key Stage 2 (Ages 7-11)

Key Stage 2 expands geographical range and introduces more complex human-environment interactions. Values education becomes more explicit:

**Environmental values**: Pupils learn about climate change, resource use, and sustainability. They can begin to understand trade-offs—economic development versus environmental protection, present consumption versus future needs.

**Social values**: Topics such as fair trade, migration, and development reveal global inequalities. Pupils can analyse how different values lead to different policy choices.

**Intercultural values**: Comparing lifestyles, beliefs, and practices across cultures challenges assumptions and builds respect for diversity.

Ofsted's subject report (2023) found that while primary geography has improved significantly, fieldwork often weakens in Key Stage 2. Pupils visit places but do not always "make the observations or collect data that they could analyse and present their findings." Effective values education requires authentic engagement with places, not just passive observation.

Pedagogical approaches suitable for Key Stage 2 include:
- **Enquiry-based learning**: Investigating geographical questions that have no simple answers
- **Role-play and simulation**: Experiencing decision-making from different perspectives
- **Critical analysis of sources**: Examining how photographs, maps, and texts represent places and people
- **Action projects**: Applying geographical learning to improve the local environment

### Key Stage 3 (Ages 11-14)

At Key Stage 3, pupils develop more sophisticated understanding of how values shape geographical knowledge and decisions:

**Controversial issues**: Topics such as migration, climate policy, and development strategies involve competing values. Teachers should present balanced views and facilitate discussion where pupils form and articulate their own positions (Geographical Association, 2025).

**Critical geography**: Pupils can examine how geographical knowledge itself reflects power relations. Whose perspectives are represented in atlases? Who decides what counts as "development"?

**Ethical frameworks**: Introduction to concepts such as utilitarianism (greatest good for greatest number), rights-based ethics, and environmental ethics provides tools for values analysis.

**Global citizenship**: Geography contributes to pupils' development as informed, active global citizens who understand their responsibilities in an interconnected world.

The national curriculum for Key Stage 3 requires pupils to "understand the processes that give rise to key physical and human geographical features of the world" and "collect, analyse and communicate with a range of data gathered through experiences of fieldwork." Values education should be integrated throughout, not treated as an add-on.

### Key Stage 4 and GCSE (Ages 14-16)

GCSE geography provides opportunities for in-depth examination of values-laden issues:

- **Resource management**: Evaluating different energy strategies involves weighing environmental, economic, and social values
- **Development and inequality**: Analysing how different value systems conceptualise and measure "development"
- **Urban challenges**: Comparing market-based and planning-based approaches to urban problems
- **Fieldwork investigation**: Conducting independent enquiries that require consideration of ethical research practices and value positions

Ofsted (2023) found that many schools simplify GCSE fieldwork so pupils can give prepared answers in exams, leaving them ill-equipped for A-Level non-examined assessment. Authentic fieldwork that engages with real places and issues is essential for values education at this level.

Examination specifications increasingly require evaluation of geographical issues. This demands that pupils recognise and articulate the value positions underlying different arguments, not merely list facts.

### Post-16 (Ages 16-18)

A-Level geography provides the most sophisticated engagement with values and attitudes:

**Epistemological awareness**: Understanding how geographical knowledge is constructed, including how researchers' values influence their questions and methods.

**Theoretical frameworks**: Engaging with competing paradigms—positivism, humanism, Marxism, feminism, post-colonialism—that embody different value commitments.

**Independent investigation**: The non-examined assessment requires students to design, conduct, and write up their own research, including ethical considerations and reflection on how their own values might influence findings.

**Contemporary debates**: Topics such as geopolitics, global governance, and environmental futures require analysis of competing value systems and their real-world consequences.

## Teaching Controversial Issues

### Defining Controversy in Geography

Geography is "a discipline laden with attitudes and values" (Open University, 2024). Many topics that geography teachers address are controversial because they involve:

- **Competing stakeholder interests**: Fracking, airport expansion, housing development
- **Uncertain evidence**: Climate change projections, earthquake prediction
- **Ethical dilemmas**: Population control, conservation versus human welfare
- **Political polarisation**: Immigration, international aid, military intervention

Teaching controversial issues effectively requires careful planning and skilled facilitation.

### The Balance and Neutrality Debate

Traditional guidance has emphasised teacher neutrality or balance when addressing controversial issues. Teachers should present multiple perspectives without revealing their own position, allowing students to reach their own conclusions.

However, research by McPartland (2006) and others has revealed the complexity of this ideal. Teachers' values influence their questioning, selection of materials, and classroom management in ways that may be unconscious. Attempting to maintain strict neutrality can:

- **Imply that all positions are equally valid**, when some may be factually incorrect or ethically indefensible
- **Remove the teacher's expertise**, when students benefit from seeing how informed adults reason about complex issues
- **Fail to challenge problematic views**, allowing misconceptions and prejudices to go unchallenged

Alternative approaches include:

**Committed impartiality**: The teacher is committed to democratic values and procedures but impartial between legitimate viewpoints within that framework. Racist or discriminatory views are challenged, but reasonable differences about policy are explored openly.

**Advocacy with exposure**: The teacher may express a view but ensures students are exposed to alternatives and taught skills for evaluating arguments.

**Staged controversy**: Teachers deliberately present and argue from different positions, making the process of perspective-taking explicit.

### Practical Strategies for Controversial Issues

The Geographical Association (2025) offers specific guidance for teaching values and controversial issues:

1. **Establish ground rules**: Create a classroom climate where different views can be expressed respectfully. Address the difference between disagreement about ideas and personal attacks.

2. **Use structured discussion formats**: Techniques such as debate, deliberative forums, and Philosophy for Children provide frameworks for productive disagreement.

3. **Present diverse perspectives authentically**: Ensure that viewpoints are represented by their best advocates, not straw men. Include voices often marginalised in mainstream media.

4. **Distinguish facts, values, and predictions**: Help students recognise what is known, what is valued, and what is uncertain. Climate change is scientifically established; the best policy response involves values as well as facts.

5. **Connect to lived experience**: Abstract issues become more meaningful when connected to students' own lives and communities.

6. **Provide action opportunities**: Feeling that one can act on values increases engagement. This might involve local environmental projects, campaigning, or lifestyle changes.

## Pedagogical Approaches for Values and Attitudes

### Enquiry-Based Learning

Enquiry-based learning is particularly suited to values education because it:
- Begins with questions that have no predetermined answers
- Requires investigation of different perspectives
- Demands critical evaluation of evidence
- Culminates in reasoned arguments rather than received conclusions

Margaret Roberts' model of geographical enquiry (2013) emphasises moving from initial questions through data collection and interpretation to informed conclusions and, crucially, reflection on how conclusions were reached and what values influenced the enquiry.

### Dialogic Teaching

Dialogic teaching, developed by Alexander (2008) and applied to geography by the Geographical Association, uses classroom talk as a tool for developing thinking. Key features include:

- **Collective**: Teachers and students address learning tasks together
- **Reciprocal**: Teachers and students listen to each other and share ideas
- **Supportive**: Students articulate ideas freely without fear of embarrassment
- **Cumulative**: Teachers and students build on their own and each other's contributions
- **Purposeful**: Classroom talk is structured towards specific learning goals

In values education, dialogic teaching creates space for students to articulate, test, and refine their values through interaction with peers and the teacher.

### Experiential and Outdoor Learning

Direct experience of places—fieldwork, outdoor education, and local exploration—is powerful for values development because it:
- Engages emotions and senses, not just cognition
- Creates personal connections to places and issues
- Challenges abstract assumptions with concrete realities
- Develops place attachment that motivates environmental concern

Ofsted (2021, 2023) consistently identifies fieldwork as a strength in early years and Key Stage 1, but a weakness in later key stages where it becomes tokenistic. Restoring meaningful experiential learning is essential for values education.

### Critical Media Literacy

Geography teachers increasingly draw on media sources—news reports, documentaries, social media—to engage students with contemporary issues. However, these sources embed values and perspectives that students must learn to identify and evaluate.

Critical media literacy in geography involves:
- Analysing whose perspectives are represented and whose are absent
- Examining how language and imagery construct particular representations of places and people
- Identifying the values embedded in seemingly neutral accounts
- Comparing coverage of the same issue across different sources

## Assessment of Values and Attitudes

### Challenges in Assessment

Assessing values and attitudes presents significant challenges:

- **Privacy**: Values are personal; requiring students to disclose them may be intrusive
- **Authenticity**: Students may give the answers they believe teachers want to hear
- **Development**: Values change overtime; assessment captures only a moment
- **Validity**: Observable behaviours may not reflect internal values

### Formative Assessment Approaches

Formative assessment of values is more appropriate and feasible than summative grading:

**Reflective journals**: Students record their thinking about geographical issues over time, revealing how values evolve and providing material for metacognitive reflection.

**Self-assessment rubrics**: Students evaluate their own attitudes against criteria such as openness to different perspectives, willingness to revise opinions, and respect for evidence.

**Peer assessment**: Structured observation of group work can assess how students engage with diverse viewpoints, though this must be handled sensitively.

**Contribution tracking**: Recording participation in discussions provides evidence of engagement with values-laden topics, though quantity of contribution does not indicate quality of thinking.

### Avoiding Assessment Pitfalls

Teachers should avoid:

- **Grading values**: Assigning marks for holding particular views is ethically problematic and educationally counterproductive
- **Confusing knowledge and values**: Assessing whether students know what different groups believe is distinct from assessing whether students share those beliefs
- **Ignoring values in assessment**: Even if values themselves are not graded, assessment should recognise the importance of values-aware geographical thinking

## Common Misconceptions About Values in Geography

### Pupil Misconceptions

Students often bring misconceptions about values to geography lessons:

- **Value relativism**: The belief that all values are equally valid and immune from criticism. Geography teachers must help students distinguish between respecting people's right to hold views and accepting those views as equally well-founded.

- **Simple cause-effect**: Attributing complex geographical outcomes to single causes, ignoring the interplay of values, structures, and contingencies.

- **Presentism**: Judging past decisions by present-day values without understanding historical context.

- **Ethnocentrism**: Assuming that their own cultural values are universal or superior.

- **Technological optimism/pessimism**: Uncritical faith that technology will solve environmental problems, or conversely, fatalistic belief that nothing can be done.

### Teacher Misconceptions

Teachers themselves may hold misconceptions that affect their practice:

- **Values neutrality is possible**: Believing that they can present geographical content without any value bias. In reality, curriculum selection, resource choice, and interaction patterns all embed values.

- **Pupils lack values**: Assuming young people have not yet formed values about geographical issues. In fact, children often hold strong views derived from family, media, and experience.

- **Values education is indoctrination**: Fearing that any explicit values teaching imposes beliefs on students. Properly conducted, values education develops students' capacity for autonomous value reasoning.

- **Controversial issues are best avoided**: Concern about parental complaints or professional criticism may lead teachers to sanitise geographical content. This deprives students of engaging with authentic geographical questions.

## Conclusion: Geography as Values Education

Geography is uniquely positioned to contribute to values education because it deals with matters of profound human significance: how we relate to the natural world, how we organise our societies across space, how we distribute resources and opportunities, and how we understand and interact with cultural difference. These are not merely technical questions but fundamentally value-laden ones.

The Geographical Association's manifesto for school geography emphasises that the subject helps young people "explore their values and responsibilities to other people, to the environment and to the sustainability of the planet." This is not an optional add-on but central to what geography education should achieve.

Effective values education in geography requires:
- **Curriculum coherence**: Values should be integrated throughout the curriculum, not confined to discrete topics
- **Pedagogical skill**: Teachers need confidence in handling controversial issues and facilitating values-focused discussion
- **Assessment sensitivity**: Formative approaches that respect the personal nature of values while providing feedback on values-aware geographical thinking
- **Professional development**: Ongoing support for teachers navigating the challenges of values education

As environmental and social challenges intensify, the values dimension of geography education becomes ever more important. Climate change, migration, global inequality, and resource scarcity are not merely topics to be studied but issues that demand informed, ethically aware engagement. Geography classrooms should be spaces where young people develop the knowledge, skills, and values they need to become responsible global citizens.
