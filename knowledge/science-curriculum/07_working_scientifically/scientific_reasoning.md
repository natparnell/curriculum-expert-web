# Scientific Reasoning and Argumentation

## Introduction: The Centrality of Scientific Argumentation

Scientific reasoning and argumentation represent the beating heart of authentic science education. While knowledge of scientific facts provides the foundation, it is through reasoning and argumentation that pupils learn to think *like scientists*—evaluating evidence critically, constructing coherent explanations, and defending claims through logical reasoning. The UK National Curriculum for Science places "Working Scientifically" at the core of science education, explicitly requiring pupils to develop their ability to evaluate claims based on science through critical analysis of methodology, evidence, and conclusions (DfE, 2015).

The pedagogical shift towards scientific argumentation reflects a fundamental understanding that science is not merely a body of established facts, but a dynamic process of knowledge construction through evidence-based reasoning. As Driver, Newton, and Osborne (2000) established in their seminal work on establishing norms of scientific argumentation in classrooms, engaging students in argumentation helps them understand not only *what* we know in science but *how* we know it—and *why* we are justified in believing it.

## Theoretical Foundations: Why Argumentation Matters

### From Transmission to Knowledge Construction

Traditional science education often positioned pupils as passive recipients of scientific knowledge, with teachers transmitting established facts and pupils memorising them for reproduction in examinations. This transmission model fails to capture the essence of scientific practice, where knowledge emerges through processes of observation, hypothesis testing, peer review, and consensus-building through argumentation.

The contemporary understanding, grounded in extensive research by Jonathan Osborne and colleagues, recognises that argumentation is central to the scientific enterprise. Scientists construct knowledge through social processes of proposing, supporting, critiquing, and refining claims using evidence. When pupils engage in scientific argumentation, they participate in these authentic scientific practices, developing both conceptual understanding and epistemological awareness.

### The Epistemological Dimension

Scientific argumentation serves an epistemological function: it helps pupils understand the nature of scientific knowledge itself. Through constructing and evaluating arguments, pupils learn that scientific claims are not arbitrary assertions but are grounded in evidence; that multiple interpretations of evidence are often possible; that scientific knowledge is provisional and subject to revision; and that scientific consensus emerges through rigorous scrutiny by the scientific community.

Osborne et al. (2016) developed a learning progression for argumentation that demonstrates how students' capabilities develop from recognising simple claims and evidence to constructing complex multi-layered arguments involving rebuttals and consideration of alternative explanations. This progression framework provides teachers with a developmental roadmap for scaffolding argumentation skills across key stages.

## The Claim-Evidence-Reasoning (CER) Framework

### Origins and Structure

The Claim-Evidence-Reasoning (CER) framework provides a structured approach to teaching scientific argumentation that has gained widespread adoption in UK and international science classrooms. Originally developed as part of the IQWST (Investigating and Questioning our World through Science and Technology) curriculum project, the CER framework offers a simple yet powerful heuristic for organising scientific explanations.

The framework consists of three essential components:

**Claim**: An assertion or conclusion that answers a question or problem. A claim is a declarative statement that something is the case—a proposed explanation for a phenomenon, a prediction about what will happen, or a conclusion drawn from data.

**Evidence**: The data, observations, or factual information that supports the claim. Scientific evidence must be empirical—based on observation or measurement—and relevant to the claim being made. Evidence can be quantitative (numerical measurements) or qualitative (observational descriptions).

**Reasoning**: The logical connection that explains *why* the evidence supports the claim. Reasoning draws upon scientific principles, theories, and prior knowledge to create the "warrant"—the bridge between evidence and claim. This is often the most challenging component for pupils, as it requires articulating the underlying logic that makes the argument coherent.

### Variations and Extensions

While the basic CER structure provides an accessible entry point, various extensions have been developed to scaffold more sophisticated argumentation:

**CER+R (with Rebuttal)**: Adds consideration of alternative explanations or counter-evidence, developing pupils' ability to evaluate the strength of their own arguments against competing claims.

**CESR (Claim-Evidence-Science Idea-Reasoning)**: Explicitly separates the application of scientific principles ("Science Idea") from the logical reasoning, helping pupils distinguish between the factual knowledge they apply and the logical connections they construct.

**Toulmin's Argument Pattern**: A more comprehensive framework developed by philosopher Stephen Toulmin (1958), which includes claim, data, warrant, backing, qualifier, and rebuttal. Toulmin's model has been extensively applied in science education research, particularly by Sibel Erduran and colleagues, to analyse the quality of student arguments.

## Progression in Scientific Reasoning Across Key Stages

### Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS)

In the EYFS, the foundations of scientific reasoning emerge through play-based exploration and investigation. While formal argumentation is not expected, practitioners lay the groundwork by:

- Encouraging children to talk about what they observe and predict what might happen
- Supporting children to compare and contrast objects, materials, and living things
- Scaffolding simple explanations: "Why do you think that happened?"
- Valuing children's ideas and encouraging them to justify their thinking

The emphasis is on developing the language of investigation and fostering curiosity about the natural world. When a child explains that ice melts "because it's getting warm," they are making the earliest forms of claims connected to evidence and reasoning.

### Key Stage 1 (Ages 5-7)

The National Curriculum for Key Stage 1 introduces explicit expectations for scientific reasoning:

- Pupils should "gather and record data to help in answering questions"
- They should "use their observations and ideas to suggest answers to questions"
- They should identify, name, and draw the basic parts of the human body and plants, connecting observations to scientific vocabulary

At this stage, teachers introduce the basic structure of claims supported by observations. A typical Year 1 argument might be: "I think the plant needs water to grow [claim] because the one we didn't water has gone floppy [evidence]." While reasoning may be implicit, the foundation is laid for making explicit connections between evidence and claims.

The ASE (Association for Science Education) recommends using "talk moves" in primary classrooms—strategic teacher questions and responses that scaffold argumentation. Moves such as "Say more about that," "Who can add to that idea?" and "Do you agree or disagree, and why?" create classroom cultures where reasoning is expected and valued.

### Key Stage 2 (Ages 7-11)

By Key Stage 2, pupils are expected to develop more sophisticated scientific reasoning:

- "Pupils should draw conclusions based on their data and observations"
- "Use evidence to justify their ideas"
- "Use their scientific knowledge and understanding to explain their findings"

The explicit introduction of "using scientific knowledge and understanding to explain findings" marks the emergence of formal reasoning—the requirement to connect evidence and claims through scientific principles.

The CER framework becomes particularly valuable at this stage. Teachers can explicitly teach the three components, using sentence starters to scaffold each element:

- Claims: "I believe that..." / "My conclusion is..."
- Evidence: "The data shows..." / "I observed that..."
- Reasoning: "This suggests... because..." / "According to scientific understanding..."

Research by Kuhn and colleagues (as cited in ASE publications) emphasises the importance of teaching pupils to manage doubt and select appropriate evidence when faced with tasks that have multiple plausible answers—a skill that develops significantly during Key Stage 2.

### Key Stage 3 (Ages 11-14)

Key Stage 3 marks a significant expansion in expectations for scientific reasoning:

- "Use scientific theories and explanations to develop hypotheses"
- "Plan investigations to make observations and to test hypotheses"
- "Evaluate data, showing awareness of potential sources of random and systematic error"
- "Identify further questions arising from their results"

The introduction of hypothesis testing and evaluation of experimental design represents a shift towards more sophisticated reasoning about scientific methodology. Pupils must now reason not only about claims and evidence but about the quality of evidence and the validity of investigative approaches.

The CER framework at Key Stage 3 should incorporate explicit consideration of:
- The distinction between correlation and causation
- The role of controlled variables in establishing valid evidence
- The provisional nature of scientific conclusions
- Alternative explanations and rebuttals

### Key Stage 4/GCSE (Ages 14-16)

The Key Stage 4 National Curriculum and GCSE specifications demand highly developed scientific reasoning capabilities:

- "Develop their ability to evaluate claims based on science through critical analysis of the methodology, evidence, and conclusions, both qualitatively and quantitatively"
- Communicate scientific ideas through scientific reports and extended responses
- Use models to explain phenomena and make predictions

At this level, pupils must engage with authentic scientific controversies and evaluate competing claims using sophisticated epistemological criteria. The CER framework remains relevant but must be extended to include:

- Evaluation of the validity and reliability of evidence
- Assessment of the sufficiency of evidence relative to the claim
- Recognition of the role of scientific consensus
- Understanding of the limitations of scientific knowledge

## Pedagogical Approaches for Teaching Scientific Reasoning

### Explicit Instruction in Argumentation Frameworks

Research consistently supports the explicit teaching of argumentation structures. Simply providing opportunities for discussion is insufficient; pupils benefit from direct instruction in the components of arguments and the language for expressing them.

Effective approaches include:

**Modelling**: Teachers think aloud while constructing arguments, making the reasoning process visible. "I'm looking at this data and I notice that... This makes me think that... The reason I connect these is because..."

**Scaffolding**: Using graphic organisers, sentence starters, and argumentation templates to reduce cognitive load while pupils internalise structures. Templates might provide slots for claim, evidence, and reasoning with prompts for each.

**Gradual release**: Moving from heavily scaffolded practice to independent argument construction as pupils develop proficiency.

### Dialogic Teaching and Talk Moves

The quality of classroom talk profoundly influences the development of scientific reasoning. Dialogic teaching approaches, informed by the work of Robin Alexander and others, create spaces for sustained, exploratory talk where reasoning is developed collectively.

Key practices include:

**Collective reasoning**: Rather than calling on individual pupils for isolated answers, teachers facilitate whole-class construction of arguments, building on and refining each other's contributions.

**Wait time**: Providing adequate thinking time after posing questions, allowing pupils to formulate reasoned responses rather than rushing to answer.

**Revoice and elaborate**: Teachers repeat pupil contributions using more formal scientific language, modelling precision while validating the underlying thinking.

**Press for reasoning**: Following up claims with questions that demand justification: "Why do you think that?" "What makes you say that?" "What evidence supports that idea?"

### Socioscientific Issues and Authentic Contexts

Engaging pupils with socioscientific issues—debates about climate change, vaccination, genetic modification, renewable energy—provides authentic contexts for argumentation. These issues have genuine scientific dimensions alongside ethical, social, and economic considerations, requiring pupils to evaluate scientific evidence while recognising its limits.

Research indicates that argumentation around socioscientific issues develops both scientific reasoning capabilities and scientific literacy more broadly. Pupils learn to evaluate claims critically, recognise the difference between scientific and non-scientific arguments, and appreciate how scientific evidence informs but does not determine policy decisions.

### Peer Review and Argumentation Games

Structured peer review activities develop pupils' ability to evaluate arguments critically. Pupils present arguments to partners or small groups who must:
- Identify the claim, evidence, and reasoning
- Evaluate the strength of the evidence
- Suggest alternative interpretations
- Identify missing components or logical gaps

"Argumentation games" create engaging contexts for practising argumentation:

**Evidence matching**: Pupils match claims to appropriate evidence and reasoning
**Rebuttal tennis**: Partners take turns proposing claims and offering rebuttals
**Mystery tubes**: Pupils construct arguments about unseen mechanisms based on indirect evidence
**Science court**: Formal debates with pupils taking prosecution and defence roles

## Common Misconceptions and Challenges

### Challenges in Teaching Reasoning

Research by Osborne, Erduran, and others identifies several persistent challenges in teaching scientific argumentation:

**Reasoning deficit**: Pupils often struggle to provide explicit reasoning connecting evidence to claims. They may state a claim and present evidence but fail to explain the logical connection, leaving the argument incomplete.

**Over-reliance on personal opinion**: Pupils may conflate scientific argumentation with personal preference or unsupported opinion, failing to recognise the requirement for evidence-based justification.

**Binary thinking**: Pupils often approach scientific questions expecting single correct answers, struggling with the tentativeness and provisionality of scientific claims.

**Epistemological confusion**: Pupils may not understand what counts as valid evidence in science, conflating personal experience, anecdote, or authoritative pronouncements with empirical evidence.

### Addressing Misconceptions

**The "because" confusion**: Pupils frequently use "because" to connect any two ideas without establishing genuine logical connection. Teachers should explicitly teach the distinction between causal reasoning ("because" in the sense of causation) and evidentiary reasoning ("because" in the sense of justification).

**Evidence versus data**: Pupils may not distinguish between raw data and evidence selected as relevant to a specific claim. Explicit instruction in selecting and evaluating evidence addresses this confusion.

**Reasoning versus description**: Pupils may describe what happened in an investigation rather than explaining why it supports their claim. The distinction between description and explanation should be explicitly taught.

## Assessment of Scientific Reasoning

### Formative Assessment Strategies

Effective formative assessment of scientific reasoning requires attention to the quality of thinking, not merely the correctness of conclusions:

**Argument analysis**: Teachers analyse pupil arguments using frameworks such as CER or Toulmin, identifying which components are present and which require development.

**Written explanations**: Extended written responses provide evidence of reasoning capabilities. Teachers should look for explicit connections between claims, evidence, and scientific principles.

**Verbal reasoning**: Observing and recording pupil reasoning during practical work and discussions provides rich assessment data. Digital audio recording enables detailed analysis.

**Self and peer assessment**: Rubrics based on CER or Toulmin frameworks enable pupils to assess their own and others' arguments, developing metacognitive awareness of argumentation quality.

### Summative Assessment

GCSE science specifications include assessment of working scientifically, including evaluation of methodology and evidence. Extended response questions require pupils to construct arguments synthesising evidence and scientific knowledge.

Effective summative assessment items:
- Present authentic scientific contexts
- Require evaluation of competing claims
- Demand justification using appropriate scientific principles
- Assess the quality of reasoning, not merely factual recall

## Practical Implementation: Classroom Routines

### Establishing Argumentation Norms

Creating classroom cultures where argumentation thrives requires explicit attention to social norms:

**Intellectual safety**: Pupils must feel safe proposing tentative ideas and having their reasoning scrutinised. Mistakes and incomplete arguments are treated as opportunities for learning, not failure.

**Respectful challenge**: Disagreement is framed as productive engagement with ideas, not personal conflict. Pupils learn to distinguish criticising an idea from criticising a person.

**Evidence as authority**: In scientific argumentation, evidence and logical reasoning have authority over status or personal preference. This norm must be explicitly taught and modelled.

### Integrating Argumentation Across the Curriculum

Scientific reasoning should not be confined to explicit "argumentation lessons" but integrated throughout science teaching:

**Practical work**: Every investigation should include opportunities for argumentation—interpreting results, evaluating reliability, justifying conclusions.

**Explanations**: When teachers explain phenomena, they should make their reasoning visible, modelling how scientific principles connect to observable evidence.

**Textbook and media evaluation**: Pupils should critically evaluate claims in textbooks, news media, and online sources, applying argumentation frameworks to real-world texts.

**Cross-curricular connections**: Links to mathematical reasoning (data analysis), English (argumentative writing), and citizenship (evaluating socioscientific issues) reinforce the transferability of reasoning skills.

## Conclusion: Towards Scientific Literacy Through Argumentation

Scientific reasoning and argumentation are not optional add-ons to science education but are fundamental to developing scientifically literate citizens. The ability to evaluate claims based on evidence, to construct coherent explanations, and to recognise the characteristics of valid scientific reasoning is essential for participation in democratic societies where science-informed decisions shape policy and practice.

The CER framework and related approaches provide accessible entry points for teaching argumentation, but their value lies not in mechanical adherence to a template but in developing pupils' capacity for evidence-based reasoning. As pupils progress through key stages, the sophistication of their reasoning should develop—from simple claims supported by observations to complex evaluations of competing explanations grounded in scientific theory and critical analysis of evidence quality.

Ultimately, teaching scientific reasoning is about more than preparing pupils for examinations. It is about equipping them with the intellectual tools to navigate a world saturated with claims about scientific matters—from health and climate to technology and genetics—and to participate thoughtfully in the scientific dimensions of civic life.
