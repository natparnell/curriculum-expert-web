# Types of Scientific Enquiry

## Overview

The Department for Education (DfE) in England mandates five specific **types of scientific enquiry** that pupils must encounter throughout key stages 1 and 2. These enquiry types form the disciplinary backbone of "working scientifically" and should not be taught as a separate strand but rather embedded within the substantive content of biology, chemistry, and physics.

The five statutory enquiry types are:

1. **Observing over time** – monitoring changes that occur across various timescales
2. **Pattern seeking** – identifying relationships where variables cannot be controlled
3. **Identifying, classifying and grouping** – sorting and organising based on observable characteristics
4. **Comparative and fair testing (controlled investigations)** – changing one variable to observe effects whilst controlling others
5. **Researching using secondary sources** – using existing information to answer scientific questions

The Primary Science Teaching Trust (PSTT) additionally recognises **problem solving** as a sixth enquiry type, where pupils apply prior scientific knowledge to find solutions to practical problems.

These enquiry types equip pupils with the understanding of the **nature, processes and methods of science**—enabling them to answer scientific questions about the world around them through systematic investigation rather than relying on assumption or anecdote.

## Observing Over Time

### Definition and Purpose

**Observing over time** involves pupils making systematic observations to detect and monitor changes that occur gradually. Unlike instantaneous observations, this enquiry type requires sustained attention across timescales ranging from minutes to months—or even years in longitudinal studies.

The DfE National Curriculum (2015) explicitly includes "observing changes over a period of time" as a core skill for key stage 1 pupils, building foundations for more sophisticated temporal analysis in key stage 2.

### Characteristics of Effective Observation Over Time

Effective observation over time enquiries share several defining characteristics:

- **Systematic recording** – Observations must be documented at regular intervals using consistent methods
- **Appropriate timescale selection** – The observation period must suit the phenomenon (e.g., ice melting requires minutes; plant growth requires weeks)
- **Controlled conditions** – Environmental factors should remain stable unless the investigation specifically examines their influence
- **Multiple data points** – Single observations are insufficient; trends only emerge from repeated measurement

### Pedagogical Approaches

Teachers should explicitly teach the skills of sustained observation, as children often struggle with patience and attention to incremental change. The ASE (Association for Science Education) recommends:

- Using **photographic sequences** to capture change that occurs too slowly for direct perception
- Employing **data loggers** and digital sensors for precise, automatic recording
- Creating **observation stations** where pupils can independently check progress
- Developing **prediction skills** by asking pupils to hypothesise about what they will observe next

### Examples Across the Curriculum

| Year Group | Topic | Observation Over Time Activity |
|------------|-------|-------------------------------|
| Year 1 | Plants | Watching beans germinate and grow over several weeks |
| Year 2 | Materials | Observing ice melting at different temperatures |
| Year 3 | Rocks | Monitoring weathering of rocks left in different conditions |
| Year 4 | States of matter | Tracking evaporation from containers with different surface areas |
| Year 5 | Life cycles | Observing caterpillar metamorphosis into butterflies |
| Year 6 | Evolution | Tracking changes in bird populations at feeding stations across seasons |

### Common Pupil Misconceptions

Ofsted's research review (2021) identified several misconceptions related to observation over time:

- **Confusing correlation with causation** – Pupils may assume that because two things happened sequentially, one caused the other
- **Expecting linear change** – Many natural processes are non-linear (e.g., plant growth often follows an S-curve), but pupils expect steady, constant change
- **Ignoring variability** – Pupils may dismiss anomalous readings rather than recognising natural variation

### Assessment Considerations

When assessing observation over time, teachers should evaluate:

- The sophistication of recording methods (pictorial → tally charts → tables → graphs)
- The ability to identify trends and patterns in collected data
- Understanding of why sustained observation is necessary (as opposed to single observations)

## Pattern Seeking

### Definition and Distinctive Features

**Pattern seeking** is the enquiry type pupils use when they want to find relationships between variables but cannot control all the factors involved. Unlike fair testing, where conditions are deliberately controlled, pattern seeking acknowledges the complexity of the natural world and seeks correlations within existing variation.

The DfE includes "pattern seeking" as a statutory requirement, recognising that many scientific questions—particularly in biology and earth science—cannot be answered through controlled experiment.

### When to Use Pattern Seeking

Pattern seeking is appropriate when:

- Ethical considerations prevent manipulation (e.g., studying the effect of sleep on concentration in humans)
- Practical constraints make control impossible (e.g., weather patterns, animal behaviour in the wild)
- The phenomenon involves inherent variability that cannot be eliminated (e.g., human height, leaf size)
- Large-scale data collection is more reliable than small-scale control (e.g., epidemiological studies)

### The Pattern Seeking Process

According to the PSTT, effective pattern seeking involves:

1. **Formulating a question about relationships** – "Is there a relationship between X and Y?"
2. **Identifying measurable variables** – Defining exactly what will be measured and how
3. **Collecting data from multiple samples** – The larger the sample size, the more reliable any identified pattern
4. **Representing data to reveal patterns** – Using scatter graphs, bar charts, or line graphs appropriately
5. **Making claims with appropriate certainty** – Understanding that correlation does not prove causation

### Classroom Applications

Effective pattern seeking enquiries in the primary classroom include:

- **Year 1**: Is there a pattern between the colour of snails and where they are found?
- **Year 3**: Do larger leaves come from larger plants?
- **Year 4**: Is there a relationship between the length of a pendulum and its swing time?
- **Year 5**: Do taller children have larger arm spans?
- **Year 6**: Is there a pattern between the distance of planets from the sun and their orbital period?

### Teaching Challenges

Ofsted's 2023 science subject report "Finding the Optimum" highlighted that many primary schools neglect pattern seeking, focusing disproportionately on fair testing. This creates an imbalance in pupils' scientific experience and may lead to the misconception that all science involves controlled experiments.

Teachers should explicitly discuss **why** pattern seeking is being used instead of fair testing, helping pupils understand the epistemological distinction between experimental and observational science.

### Developing Mathematical Connections

Pattern seeking provides rich opportunities to develop data handling skills:

- **Scatter graphs** for continuous variables (e.g., height vs. arm span)
- **Bar charts** for discrete categories (e.g., plant type vs. leaf count)
- **Calculating averages** to summarise data sets
- **Identifying outliers** and discussing their significance

## Identifying, Classifying and Grouping

### Conceptual Overview

**Identifying, classifying and grouping** involves pupils making observations of similarities and differences to sort objects or organisms into categories. This enquiry type develops the fundamental scientific skill of taxonomy—the organisation of knowledge into meaningful systems.

The DfE includes "identifying, classifying and grouping" as a statutory enquiry type, with progression from simple sorting in key stage 1 to more sophisticated classification using keys and hierarchical systems in key stage 2.

### Distinctions Between Grouping, Classifying and Identifying

Whilst often used interchangeably, these terms represent distinct but related processes:

- **Grouping** – Sorting items based on observable characteristics (can be informal)
- **Classifying** – Sorting according to recognised scientific criteria and categories
- **Identifying** – Using classification systems to name unknown items (often using dichotomous keys)

### Developmental Progression

The ASE and PSTT identify a clear progression in classifying skills across primary years:

**Key Stage 1**:
- Sorting by single criteria (colour, size, shape)
- Grouping materials by simple physical properties
- Sorting living things into basic categories (plants/animals)

**Lower Key Stage 2**:
- Using branching keys to identify organisms
- Recognising that classification systems are human constructions
- Sorting by multiple criteria simultaneously

**Upper Key Stage 2**:
- Understanding hierarchical classification (kingdom → species)
- Creating original classification keys
- Evaluating the usefulness of different classification systems
- Recognising that classification changes as scientific understanding develops

### Pedagogical Strategies

Effective teaching of classification involves:

- **Using real specimens** wherever possible rather than photographs
- **Invented classification** – Having pupils create their own systems before learning scientific ones
- **Debate and discussion** – Exploring why scientists might disagree about classification (e.g., the status of viruses)
- **Keys that work** – Ensuring dichotomous keys use unambiguous, observable features

### Cross-Curricular Connections

Classification skills transfer across the curriculum:

- **Mathematics** – Venn diagrams, Carroll diagrams, sets
- **Computing** – Sorting algorithms, databases, binary trees
- **Geography** – Classification of settlements, climates, rock types

### Addressing Common Misconceptions

Pupils frequently hold misconceptions about classification:

- **Essentialism** – Believing that categories have fixed, unchangeable essences
- **Anthropocentrism** – Judging all organisms by human standards and characteristics
- **Static view** – Not understanding that classification systems evolve as knowledge advances

Teachers should explicitly discuss how scientific classification has changed (e.g., the reclassification of Pluto, the discovery of new species) to challenge these static views.

## Comparative and Fair Testing (Controlled Investigations)

### Understanding Fair Testing

**Comparative and fair testing**—also called controlled investigation—is the enquiry type most commonly associated with scientific method in public understanding. It involves deliberately changing one variable (the independent variable) whilst keeping all others constant, to observe the effect on a measured outcome (the dependent variable).

The DfE National Curriculum requires that pupils engage in "comparative and fair testing (controlled investigations)" throughout key stages 1 and 2, with increasing sophistication in understanding variables and control.

### The Logic of Control

The fundamental logic of fair testing is:

1. If all factors remain identical between two tests except one
2. And a difference is observed in the outcome
3. Then the differing factor caused the difference in outcome

This **causal inference** is only valid when control has been achieved. Teaching pupils to recognise and manage variables is therefore essential.

### Variable Types

Pupils must learn to distinguish between:

- **Independent variable** – The factor deliberately changed by the investigator
- **Dependent variable** – The factor measured or observed to see if it changes
- **Controlled variables** – Factors kept constant to ensure a fair test

By upper key stage 2, pupils should be able to identify all three variable types in a given investigation and explain why control is necessary.

### Progression in Fair Testing

**Key Stage 1**:
- Simple comparative tests (comparing two materials)
- Understanding "fairness" in everyday language
- Teacher-led identification of obvious variables

**Lower Key Stage 2**:
- Planning fair tests with support
- Recognising when a test is unfair
- Measuring dependent variables with increasing precision

**Upper Key Stage 2**:
- Independent planning of controlled investigations
- Considering measurement error and repeatability
- Understanding that "keeping everything the same" is an ideal rather than always achievable
- Beginning to consider sample size and reliability

### Practical Examples

| Year Group | Investigation | Independent Variable | Dependent Variable | Controlled Variables |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Year 2 | Which material is best for a towel? | Material type | Amount of water absorbed | Volume of water, time, temperature |
| Year 3 | How does ramp height affect distance travelled? | Ramp height | Distance ball rolls | Same ball, same surface, same release point |
| Year 4 | Which magnet is strongest? | Magnet type | Number of paperclips held | Same paperclips, same testing position |
| Year 5 | How does voltage affect bulb brightness? | Battery voltage | Bulb brightness (or current) | Same bulb, same wires, same circuit |
| Year 6 | How does the length of wire affect resistance? | Wire length | Current/brightness | Same thickness, same material, same temperature |

### Common Pitfalls

Primary pupils frequently struggle with:

- **Confusing independent and dependent variables** – Need explicit teaching of which is changed and which is measured
- **Incomplete control** – Difficulty identifying all variables that should be controlled
- **Measurement issues** – Not understanding that measurements have uncertainty
- **Single measurements** – Not recognising the value of repeats for reliability

### The Role of CLEAPSS and Safety

The PSTT directs teachers to CLEAPSS (Consortium of Local Education Authorities for the Provision of Science Services) for health and safety guidance when planning practical activities. For fair testing enquiries, particular attention should be paid to:

- Electrical safety in circuit investigations
- Allergies when testing materials
- Safe handling of magnets (pinch hazards)
- Appropriate use of heating equipment

## Researching Using Secondary Sources

### The Role of Secondary Research

**Researching using secondary sources** involves pupils finding and using existing information to answer scientific questions rather than collecting primary data themselves. This enquiry type reflects the reality of scientific practice—scientists spend considerable time reviewing literature, examining databases, and analysing data collected by others.

The DfE includes "researching using secondary sources" as a statutory enquiry type, recognising its importance for questions that are:

- Too large in scale for primary investigation (e.g., solar system movements)
- Too dangerous to investigate directly (e.g., effects of smoking)
- Based on historical data (e.g., climate change over centuries)
- Reliant on expert knowledge (e.g., the structure of DNA)

### Developing Research Skills

Effective secondary research requires specific skills that must be explicitly taught:

**Information Location**:
- Using age-appropriate sources (books, approved websites, videos)
- Understanding that search engines return varying quality results
- Knowing when to seek expert input

**Information Evaluation**:
- Assessing source reliability and authority
- Distinguishing between fact and opinion
- Recognising potential bias
- Checking publication dates for currency

**Information Synthesis**:
- Combining information from multiple sources
- Recognising when sources disagree
- Citing sources appropriately

### Digital Literacy Considerations

The ASE emphasises that researching using secondary sources provides opportunities to develop critical digital literacy:

- **Website evaluation** – Teaching pupils to check domain types (.gov, .edu, .org, .com)
- **Fact-checking** – Cross-referencing claims across multiple sources
- **Recognising misinformation** – Discussing how scientific misconceptions spread online
- **Safe searching** – Using filtered search engines appropriate for age

### Practical Applications

Secondary research enquiries suitable for primary pupils include:

- **Year 1**: What do different animals eat? (using books and videos)
- **Year 3**: What are the names and properties of common rocks? (using identification guides)
- **Year 4**: How do different animals digest food? (using secondary sources—dissection alternatives)
- **Year 5**: What are the relative sizes and distances of planets? (using astronomical data)
- **Year 6**: How have theories about evolution changed over time? (using historical sources)

### Integrating with Other Enquiry Types

Secondary research often complements primary investigation:

- **Prior to investigation** – Researching what is already known to inform prediction
- **During investigation** – Looking up explanations for unexpected observations
- **After investigation** – Comparing results with published findings

### Assessment of Research Skills

Teachers should assess:

- **Selection of appropriate sources** – Can pupils explain why they chose particular references?
- **Note-taking strategies** – Are pupils recording information in their own words?
- **Citation** – Do pupils acknowledge where information came from?
- **Critical evaluation** – Can pupils identify when a source might be unreliable?

## Problem Solving as an Enquiry Type

### PSTT's Sixth Type

Whilst the DfE specifies five statutory enquiry types, the Primary Science Teaching Trust advocates for a sixth: **problem solving**. This involves pupils applying prior scientific knowledge to find solutions to practical problems.

Problem solving represents the **application** phase of learning—where pupils demonstrate that they can use their scientific understanding in novel contexts rather than simply reproducing learned facts.

### Characteristics of Scientific Problem Solving

Scientific problem solving in the primary classroom typically involves:

- **Open-ended challenges** – Multiple valid solutions may exist
- **Constraint-based design** – Solutions must work within specified limitations (materials, cost, time)
- **Iterative improvement** – Initial designs are tested and refined
- **Application of scientific principles** – Solutions must be grounded in scientific understanding, not trial-and-error alone

### Examples of Problem-Solving Enquiries

- **Designing an umbrella for a teddy bear** – Applying understanding of waterproof materials and structures
- **Creating the slowest parachute** – Applying knowledge of air resistance
- **Insulating an ice cube** – Applying understanding of thermal conductors and insulators
- **Building the strongest bridge** – Applying knowledge of forces and structures
- **Designing a
