# Mary Ratcliffe: Science Education for Citizenship

## Biography and Academic Career

Mary Ratcliffe is a distinguished figure in science education research, particularly recognised for her influential work on socio-scientific issues (SSIs) and science education for citizenship. As a Senior Lecturer in Science Education at the University of Southampton, she has made significant contributions to both initial teacher education and continuing professional development for science teachers across the United Kingdom.

Ratcliffe's journey into science education began in the classroom. Prior to her academic career, she taught chemistry and science in schools in East Anglia, gaining invaluable practical experience that would later inform her research and teacher education work. This practitioner background distinguishes her scholarship, ensuring that her theoretical contributions remain grounded in the realities of classroom practice. Her qualifications include a BSc, MSc, PhD, and CChem FRSC (Chartered Chemist and Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry), alongside her PGCE, reflecting both her scientific expertise and her professional commitment to education.

At the University of Southampton, Ratcliffe teaches across PGCE, Masters, and research programmes, shaping the next generation of science educators. Her research interests centre on three interconnected areas: pupils' and teachers' reactions to socio-scientific issues; understanding of the nature of science; and the development of effective learning and assessment practices. This tripartite focus reflects her holistic view of science education as encompassing not merely the transmission of scientific content but the cultivation of scientifically literate citizens capable of engaging with complex societal issues.

Ratcliffe has also contributed significantly to professional leadership within science education. She served as Chair-elect of the Association for Science Education (ASE), one of the UK's leading professional bodies for science educators, demonstrating her commitment to bridging research and practice at a national level.

## Socio-Scientific Issues: A Framework for Science Education

### Defining Socio-Scientific Issues

Ratcliffe's most significant contribution to science education lies in her development and promotion of socio-scientific issues (SSIs) as a central organising framework for science teaching. Socio-scientific issues are complex, real-world problems that have both scientific and social dimensions, requiring students to draw upon scientific knowledge whilst considering ethical, economic, political, and social factors.

Examples of socio-scientific issues include:
- Genetic modification and its implications for food production and medicine
- Climate change and energy policy decisions
- Vaccination programmes and public health
- Stem cell research and regenerative medicine
- Nuclear power and radioactive waste disposal
- Biodiversity conservation and land use

What distinguishes SSIs from traditional science topics is their inherent controversy and multidimensionality. They are characterised by:
- **Scientific uncertainty**: The science may be incomplete or contested
- **Multiple stakeholder perspectives**: Different groups may hold legitimate but conflicting views
- **Ethical dimensions**: Questions of right and wrong are often central
- **Value-laden nature**: Personal and societal values influence how issues are framed and resolved
- **Relevance to everyday life**: The issues connect directly to students' lived experiences and futures

### Rationale for SSI-Based Science Education

Ratcliffe argues that traditional science education, focused primarily on the acquisition of established scientific knowledge, is insufficient for preparing young people to participate effectively in democratic societies. In an age where scientific and technological developments profoundly shape social life, citizens need not only scientific knowledge but also the capacity to evaluate scientific claims, understand the limits of scientific certainty, and engage in informed decision-making about complex issues.

The rationale for SSI-based science education includes:

**Democratic participation**: Science-related issues increasingly dominate public policy debates. Citizens who lack the skills to engage with these issues are effectively disenfranchised from important democratic decisions.

**Scientific literacy**: Contemporary understandings of scientific literacy extend beyond knowledge of scientific content to include understanding of the nature of science, the ability to engage with science in the media, and the capacity to make evidence-informed decisions.

**Student motivation**: SSIs connect science to students' interests and concerns, potentially increasing engagement and motivation to learn science.

**Authenticity**: SSIs reflect how science actually functions in society—as contested, provisional, and shaped by social contexts—rather than presenting science as a fixed body of facts.

## The Five Dimensions of Ideas-About-Science

### Developing a Pedagogical Framework

In collaboration with Hannah Bartholomew and Jonathan Osborne, Ratcliffe developed a influential framework for teaching "ideas-about-science"—aspects of the nature of science, its processes, and its practices that are essential for scientific literacy. This work emerged from a research project working with eleven UK teachers over a year to develop effective approaches to teaching the nature of science.

The framework identifies five dimensions of ideas-about-science that should be addressed in science education:

### Dimension 1: The Nature and Status of Scientific Knowledge

This dimension addresses fundamental questions about what scientific knowledge is and how it differs from other forms of knowledge. Key ideas include:
- Science is based on evidence, but observations are theory-laden
- Scientific knowledge is durable but provisional—subject to revision in light of new evidence
- There are limits to scientific knowledge; science cannot answer all questions
- Scientific explanations are more reliable than common-sense explanations but are not absolutely certain

Teaching this dimension helps students understand that scientific knowledge is constructed through human activity rather than simply discovered, and that whilst science provides reliable knowledge, it operates within limits.

### Dimension 2: The Construction of Scientific Knowledge

This dimension focuses on how scientific knowledge is developed through research and investigation. Key aspects include:
- The role of observation, experimentation, and modelling in scientific inquiry
- How scientists generate and test hypotheses
- The importance of reproducibility and peer review
- How scientific consensus emerges through community practices

Understanding these processes enables students to evaluate scientific claims they encounter in public discourse and appreciate the rigorous methods through which scientific knowledge is validated.

### Dimension 3: The Methods of Science

This dimension examines the diverse methods used in scientific inquiry, challenging the notion of a single "scientific method." Students should understand:
- The variety of methods scientists employ, from controlled experiments to field observations
- The relationship between questions asked and methods chosen
- The role of creativity and imagination in scientific work
- How technological developments enable new methods and discoveries

Recognising methodological diversity helps students appreciate the richness of scientific practice and avoid simplistic stereotypes.

### Dimension 4: The Nature of Scientific Community

Science is a social enterprise, and this dimension addresses how scientific communities function. Key ideas include:
- The role of collaboration and competition in driving scientific progress
- How peer review and publication maintain quality standards
- The influence of funding structures and institutional contexts on research priorities
- How scientific communities respond to anomalous findings and paradigm shifts

Understanding the social nature of science helps students see scientific knowledge as the product of human institutions rather than abstract, disembodied truths.

### Dimension 5: Science and Society

This dimension, most closely connected to Ratcliffe's work on socio-scientific issues, examines the relationships between science and wider society. It encompasses:
- How social and cultural contexts influence scientific research priorities and interpretations
- The ethical dimensions of scientific research and its applications
- How science informs policy decisions and public debate
- The role of science in addressing global challenges

This dimension is essential for preparing students to engage critically with science-related issues in their civic lives.

## Teaching Strategies for Socio-Scientific Issues

### Developing Decision-Making Skills

Central to Ratcliffe's approach is the development of students' decision-making capabilities. She argues that science education should equip young people with the skills to make informed decisions about complex issues where scientific knowledge is necessary but not sufficient.

The decision-making process Ratcliffe advocates involves several stages:

**Identifying and clarifying the issue**: Students learn to recognise when a situation has socio-scientific dimensions and to identify the key questions at stake.

**Gathering and evaluating information**: Students develop skills in finding relevant scientific information and assessing its reliability, considering factors such as source credibility, evidence quality, and potential bias.

**Identifying stakeholders and perspectives**: Students learn to recognise that SSIs involve multiple stakeholders with different interests and values, and to understand perspectives different from their own.

**Considering ethical dimensions**: Students develop capacity to identify ethical issues and to reason about them, recognising that ethical questions may not have definitive answers.

**Making and justifying decisions**: Students learn to make decisions based on available evidence and values, and to articulate and defend their reasoning.

**Reflecting on the process**: Students develop metacognitive awareness of how they approached the decision and what factors influenced their thinking.

### Assessment of Socio-Scientific Reasoning

Ratcliffe has contributed significantly to developing approaches for assessing students' socio-scientific reasoning. Traditional science assessments often fail to capture the complex capabilities required for engaging with SSIs. She advocates for assessment strategies that:

- Evaluate students' ability to identify and clarify issues
- Assess their capacity to gather and evaluate evidence from multiple sources
- Examine their reasoning about ethical and values-based dimensions
- Consider the quality of their argumentation and justification
- Evaluate their awareness of alternative perspectives

Such assessments often take the form of extended written responses, group discussions, or portfolios, rather than standardised tests. Ratcliffe emphasises that assessment should be authentic, reflecting the kinds of reasoning actually required when engaging with real-world issues.

### Classroom Pedagogies

Ratcliffe's work identifies several effective pedagogical approaches for SSI-based teaching:

**Discussion and dialogue**: Creating classroom spaces where students can explore different perspectives and practice articulating and defending their views. This requires establishing norms of respectful listening and constructive argumentation.

**Case studies**: Using real or realistic scenarios to make abstract issues concrete and engage students' interest and emotions.

**Role play and simulation**: Enabling students to inhabit different stakeholder perspectives, developing empathy and understanding of how different positions arise.

**Inquiry-based approaches**: Supporting students to investigate questions they have identified, developing research skills alongside scientific understanding.

**Explicit teaching of nature of science**: Directly addressing ideas-about-science as curriculum content, not assuming they will be picked up implicitly through science content instruction.

## Evidence-Based Practice in Science Education

### The EPSE Research Network

Ratcliffe was a key member of the Evidence-based Practice in Science Education (EPSE) Research Network, a major initiative funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). Working alongside prominent researchers including Robin Millar, John Leach, and Jonathan Osborne, she contributed to developing approaches for making research evidence more accessible and usable for science teachers.

The EPSE network recognised a persistent gap between research knowledge and classroom practice. Teachers often struggled to access, interpret, and apply research findings, whilst researchers frequently produced work that, whilst rigorous, did not address teachers' practical concerns. The network sought to bridge this gap through collaborative research that engaged teachers as partners.

### Principles of Evidence-Informed Practice

Ratcliffe advocates for "evidence-informed" rather than "evidence-based" practice—a subtle but significant distinction. Evidence-based practice implies that research can provide definitive answers about what works, to be implemented faithfully by practitioners. Evidence-informed practice recognises that:

- Research evidence is always partial and contextual
- Teachers must exercise professional judgment in applying research to their specific situations
- Evidence from research needs to be integrated with teachers' own practitioner inquiry and knowledge of their students
- Professional expertise involves interpreting and adapting research, not merely following prescriptions

This perspective respects both the value of research evidence and the necessity of teacher professional judgment, avoiding the uncritical adoption of "what works" recipes whilst still grounding practice in the best available evidence.

## Concept Cartoons and Visual Learning Tools

Whilst the concept cartoons were developed by Stuart Naylor and Brenda Keogh at Millgate House Education, Ratcliffe's work has connections to this approach through her emphasis on making student thinking visible and stimulating discussion. Concept cartoons present students with cartoon-style drawings showing characters expressing different views about a scientific phenomenon, often including common misconceptions alongside scientifically accurate ideas.

The pedagogical principles underlying concept cartoons align closely with Ratcliffe's approach:
- Making thinking explicit so it can be examined and discussed
- Presenting alternative viewpoints to stimulate consideration of evidence
- Creating safe spaces for students to explore ideas without fear of being "wrong"
- Using visual and narrative elements to engage student interest

Ratcliffe's work on socio-scientific issues similarly employs strategies to surface and examine student thinking, recognising that effective science education must engage with learners' existing ideas and reasoning processes.

## Cross-Curricular and Citizenship Connections

### Science and Citizenship Education

Ratcliffe has been a strong advocate for stronger connections between science education and citizenship education. She argues that these subjects, often taught in isolation, share common goals in preparing young people for democratic participation. Citizenship education provides frameworks for understanding democratic processes, rights, and responsibilities; science education provides the content knowledge and analytical skills needed to engage with science-related civic issues.

In collaboration with Marcus Grace, Ratcliffe explored how cross-curricular approaches might support students' development as scientifically literate citizens. This work recognised that:
- SSIs are inherently interdisciplinary, drawing on science, ethics, politics, and economics
- Students need opportunities to develop both scientific understanding and civic capabilities
- Collaborative teaching between science and citizenship specialists can model the interdisciplinary nature of real-world issues

### Ethical Dimensions of Science

A significant strand of Ratcliffe's work addresses the teaching of ethical aspects of science. She recognises that SSIs are often ethically complex, involving conflicting values and legitimate disagreements about what should be done. Teaching about these issues requires:

- Creating classroom environments where ethical questions can be explored openly
- Helping students distinguish ethical questions from scientific questions
- Supporting students to use ethical reasoning frameworks
- Acknowledging that reasonable people may disagree about ethical matters

Ratcliffe argues that avoiding ethical dimensions of science does students a disservice, leaving them unprepared for the complex value-laden decisions they will face as citizens.

## Impact and Legacy

### Influence on Curriculum and Policy

Ratcliffe's work has influenced science curriculum development in the UK and internationally. Her advocacy for attention to the nature of science and socio-scientific issues contributed to the inclusion of "ideas about science" in the National Curriculum for Science. The recognition that science education should contribute to citizenship preparation has shaped curriculum documents and examination specifications.

### Contribution to Teacher Education

Through her teaching at the University of Southampton and her publications, Ratcliffe has influenced generations of science teachers. Her book *Science Education for Citizenship: Teaching Socio-Scientific Issues*, co-authored with Marcus Grace, provides practical guidance for teachers seeking to implement SSI-based approaches. The book offers:
- Rationale and background on SSIs and their educational value
- Practical guidance in devising learning goals and assessment strategies
- Classroom examples and case studies
- Support for developing teachers' own understanding of the nature of science

### International Influence

Whilst Ratcliffe's research has been primarily conducted in UK contexts, her work has influenced science education internationally. The framework of socio-scientific issues has been adopted by researchers and educators worldwide, and the five dimensions of ideas-about-science have informed curriculum development in multiple countries. Her work exemplifies how practitioner-focused research can have broad impact when it addresses widely shared challenges in science education.

## Pedagogical Implications for Classroom Practice

### Planning for SSI-Based Teaching

Ratcliffe's work suggests several considerations for teachers planning to incorporate socio-scientific issues into their science teaching:

**Selecting appropriate issues**: Not all controversial topics are suitable for classroom treatment. Teachers should consider whether issues:
- Have genuine scientific content relevant to the curriculum
- Are accessible to students given their prior knowledge
- Have multiple legitimate perspectives
- Connect to students' experiences or concerns
- Can be addressed with available resources and time

**Integrating with science content**: SSIs should not be treated as separate from science content but as contexts for learning and applying scientific understanding. Effective teaching makes explicit connections between the issue under discussion and the scientific concepts being learned.

**Building discussion skills**: Engaging productively with SSIs requires skills in discussion, argumentation, and perspective-taking. These skills need to be taught explicitly and practised regularly.

**Addressing the nature of science**: SSIs provide authentic contexts for exploring ideas about science. Teachers should seize opportunities to make the nature of science explicit rather than leaving it implicit.

### Supporting Diverse Learners

Ratcliffe's work recognises that students bring diverse perspectives, values, and experiences to SSI discussions. Effective teaching:
- Creates inclusive classroom environments where all students feel their perspectives are valued
- Acknowledges that students' cultural and religious backgrounds may influence their views on scientific issues
- Avoids positioning science as in conflict with students' values, instead seeking productive dialogue
- Differentiates support so that all students can engage with the scientific content regardless of their position on the issue

### Assessment Strategies

Assessment in SSI-based science education should:
- Evaluate understanding of relevant scientific content
- Assess capability in socio-scientific reasoning
- Consider quality of argumentation and use of evidence
- Value reflection and self-assessment
- Use authentic tasks that reflect real-world engagement with issues

Ratcliffe advocates for a broad repertoire of assessment strategies, recognising that complex capabilities cannot be adequately captured by traditional testing approaches.

## Conclusion

Mary Ratcliffe's contributions to science education centre on a fundamental reconceptualisation of what science education is for. Moving beyond a narrow focus on scientific content knowledge, her work demonstrates that science education must prepare young people to engage critically with the science-related issues they will encounter as citizens. Through her development of socio-scientific issues as a curriculum framework, her articulation of ideas-about-science, and her practical guidance for teachers, Ratcliffe has provided both theoretical foundations and practical tools for science education that serves democratic citizenship.

Her emphasis on evidence-informed practice, her recognition of the complexity of classroom teaching, and her respect for teacher professional judgment distinguish her work from both uncritical advocacy of innovation and rigid prescription of practice. Ratcliffe offers a vision of science education that is simultaneously rigorous and relevant, intellectually demanding and socially connected—a vision that continues to shape science education research and practice in the UK and beyond.
