# Robin Millar: Pioneer of Scientific Literacy and Research-Informed Science Education

## Biographical Overview

Robin Millar is one of the most influential British science education researchers of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Born in Scotland, Millar's academic journey began with a BA in Natural Sciences from Cambridge University, where he specialised in Theoretical Physics for Part II. He subsequently completed a PhD in Medical Physics at the University of Edinburgh before training as a science teacher at Moray House College, Edinburgh.

Millar spent eight years teaching physics and general science in comprehensive schools in Edinburgh, providing him with the practical classroom experience that would profoundly shape his subsequent research and curriculum development work. In 1982, he joined the Department of Education at the University of York as a Lecturer in Education, beginning an association with the institution that would span more than three decades.

His career at York was marked by steady academic advancement. He was promoted to a Personal Chair in 1996 and appointed Salters' Professor of Science Education in 2006, a position he held until his retirement in 2014. Throughout this period, Millar contributed extensively to undergraduate, PGCE, and higher degree programmes, while supervising numerous PhD students who have gone on to make their own contributions to science education.

In recognition of his outstanding contribution to science education over more than forty years, Millar was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2015. Even after retirement, he has continued writing and lecturing on science education topics, and contributes to international research projects including the OECD PISA project as a member of the Science Expert Group.

## Research Focus and Methodology

### Core Research Interests

Millar's research spans several interconnected domains within science education:

1. **Teaching, Learning, and Assessment of Conceptually Demanding Topics**: Particularly in physics, Millar has investigated how students develop understanding of difficult scientific concepts and how teachers can most effectively assess this understanding.

2. **Practical Work in Science**: Perhaps his most influential research area, Millar has extensively studied the effectiveness of practical work as a teaching and learning method, developing frameworks for analysing and improving laboratory-based instruction.

3. **Science Curriculum Policy and Design**: Millar has been centrally involved in major curriculum development initiatives, bringing research insights directly to bear on classroom practice.

4. **Research-Practice Relationships**: Throughout his career, Millar has explored how educational research can most effectively influence classroom practice, leading initiatives to bridge the gap between academic research and teacher pedagogy.

### Methodological Approach

Millar's research characteristically combines rigorous empirical investigation with deep attention to the practical realities of classroom teaching. His studies often involve:

- Detailed observational fieldwork in secondary school science classrooms
- Analysis of student performance data to identify conceptual difficulties
- Development and testing of diagnostic assessment tools
- Collaboration with practising teachers to ensure research relevance
- Longitudinal tracking of curriculum implementation effects

This methodological commitment to connecting research with practice has made Millar's work particularly influential among both academic researchers and classroom practitioners.

## The Beyond 2000 Report: Redefining the Purpose of School Science

### Origins and Context

In 1998, Millar co-authored the landmark report "Beyond 2000: Science Education for the Future" with Jonathan Osborne of King's College London. Published by the Nuffield Foundation, this report emerged from a seminar series involving leading science educators, researchers, and policymakers. Millar was a core member of this group, and the report reflected his long-standing concerns about the direction of school science education.

The report was written against a backdrop of growing dissatisfaction with the science curriculum of the 1990s. Critics argued that the curriculum had become overloaded with content, that it failed to engage many students, and that it did not adequately prepare young people for life in an increasingly scientific and technological society.

### Central Arguments

"Beyond 2000" made several radical and influential arguments:

#### The Case for Scientific Literacy

The report's most influential proposal was that the compulsory science curriculum (ages 5–16) should be designed primarily to develop the **scientific literacy** of future citizens, rather than to prepare students for advanced study in science. Millar and Osborne argued that most students would not pursue science beyond the compulsory years, yet all would need to engage with scientific issues as citizens, consumers, and members of society.

Scientific literacy, as conceptualised in the report, involves:
- Understanding key scientific concepts and their relevance to everyday life
- Appreciating the nature and limitations of scientific knowledge
- Being able to evaluate scientific claims and evidence
- Understanding how science works as a process of enquiry
- Recognising the social and ethical dimensions of scientific developments

#### The Dual Route Proposition

Millar and Osborne did not advocate reducing the rigour of science education for those who wished to pursue scientific careers. Instead, they proposed a **dual route** system:

- A **science for citizenship** course for all students, focusing on scientific literacy
- A separate, more **academically demanding course** for students choosing to specialise in science

This proposal recognised that different students have different needs from their science education, and that a one-size-fits-all approach serves neither group well.

#### Curriculum Overload

The report identified curriculum overload as a significant problem, arguing that the attempt to cover too much content resulted in superficial coverage and poor retention. Millar and Osborne advocated a significant reduction in the content specification, allowing more time for depth of understanding and for exploring the applications and implications of science.

### Impact and Legacy

"Beyond 2000" has proven one of the most influential documents in British science education history. Its arguments helped shape:

- The 2000 National Curriculum revision, which reduced content specification and introduced "ideas and evidence in science"
- The development of Twenty First Century Science (see below)
- International curriculum reforms in countries including Australia, New Zealand, and parts of the United States
- The PISA science literacy framework, with Millar subsequently contributing to PISA as a Science Expert Group member

The report's central insight—that school science should serve the needs of all future citizens, not just future scientists—has become widely accepted in science education policy and research, though implementation remains contested and incomplete.

## Twenty First Century Science: From Vision to Classroom

### Development and Structure

Building directly on the "Beyond 2000" recommendations, Millar led the development of **Twenty First Century Science**, a suite of GCSE science courses developed by the University of York Science Education Group (UYSEG) for the OCR examination board, with resources published by Oxford University Press.

The Twenty First Century Science suite represents one of the most substantial attempts to implement the scientific literacy vision in mainstream English secondary education. Over 100,000 students take these courses every year, representing a significant practical impact on science education at scale.

The suite comprises several interconnected courses:

#### GCSE Science (Core)

This course is designed for all students, focusing on scientific literacy and the science that citizens need to understand contemporary issues. It emphasises:

- Science explanations and how they are developed
- Science applications and their implications
- Science in the media and evaluating scientific claims
- The role of science in decision-making

The Core Science course explicitly does not aim to prepare students for A-level sciences; instead, it seeks to equip all young people with the scientific understanding they need for life beyond school.

#### Additional Science

For students who wish to pursue science further, Additional Science provides more traditional subject-specific content in biology, chemistry, and physics, while maintaining the Twenty First Century Science emphasis on understanding over memorisation.

#### Separate Sciences

Students can also take GCSE Biology, Chemistry, and Physics as separate subjects, with specifications that maintain the project's commitment to scientific literacy while providing fuller preparation for A-level study.

### Research-Informed Development

A distinguishing feature of Twenty First Century Science is its explicit grounding in educational research. Millar's work on analysing the effectiveness of practical activities, for instance, shaped how practical work was incorporated into the courses.

Millar's research suggests that **the objective of each practical activity must be clear** if it is to be effective. This insight led to:

- Explicit identification of learning objectives for every practical activity
- Differentiation between practicals designed to develop conceptual understanding and those focused on investigative skills
- Careful attention to the match between what students do with their hands and what they are expected to learn with their minds
- Integration of practical work with other learning activities rather than treating it as separate or supplementary

### Evaluation and Impact

Twenty First Century Science has been subject to extensive evaluation. Research findings include:

- **Engagement**: Students report greater interest in science topics that relate to contemporary issues and their own lives
- **Understanding of science**: Students following Twenty First Century Science show better understanding of the nature of science and how scientific knowledge is developed
- **Gender differences**: The courses appear particularly effective at maintaining girls' interest in science
- **Progression**: Concerns that the courses would not adequately prepare students for A-level have proven largely unfounded, though careful sequencing of Additional Science remains important

The pilot trials of Twenty First Century Science provided evidence that teaching for understanding of science in context is both feasible and effective, supporting the broader argument for scientific literacy approaches.

## Practical Work: Making It More Effective

### The Problem with Practical Work

Practical work has been central to science education since the nineteenth century, yet its effectiveness as a teaching and learning method has often been assumed rather than demonstrated. Millar, in collaboration with Ian Abrahams of the University of Roehampton, conducted ground-breaking research that challenged many assumptions about practical work.

Their study, published in 2008 in the *International Journal of Science Education* under the provocative title "Does Practical Work Really Work?", analysed 25 'typical' science lessons involving practical work in English secondary schools. Through observational field notes and tape-recorded interviews with teachers and students, they developed a model for assessing effectiveness.

### A Model of Effectiveness

Millar and Abrahams proposed that practical work can be judged effective to the extent that:

1. **Students understand what they are doing**: Many practical activities involve complex procedures that occupy students' attention without contributing to learning the intended scientific ideas.

2. **Students can link their observations to the scientific concepts being taught**: The 'messy' nature of real data often makes it difficult for students to see the intended patterns.

3. **The activity actually addresses students' learning needs**: Practical work is often used regardless of whether it is the most effective way to teach a particular concept.

4. **Students have sufficient time to think about what they are observing**: Rushed practicals may generate data without generating understanding.

### Key Findings

The research found that much practical work in schools is **ritualised**—it is done because it has always been done, rather than because it effectively achieves learning objectives. Specific findings included:

- **Cookbook practicals**: Many practical activities follow rigid procedures that leave little room for student thinking or decision-making.
- **Data-to-concept gap**: Students often successfully complete practical procedures without understanding the scientific concepts the practical is intended to illustrate.
- **Teacher demonstration alternatives**: In some cases, teacher demonstration combined with student discussion was more effective than student practical work.
- **Procedural overload**: Complex practical procedures can distract from conceptual learning.

### Implications for Practice

Millar and Abrahams's work has significant implications for how teachers use practical work:

#### Planning with Purpose

Teachers should be explicit about the **objective** of each practical activity. Millar suggests asking:
- What do I want students to learn from this activity?
- Is a practical the best way to teach this?
- If yes, what specifically must students observe or do to learn this?
- How will I know if they have learned it?

#### Managing Cognitive Load

Practical activities should minimise procedural complexity that does not contribute to learning. This might involve:
- Preparing equipment in advance for younger or less experienced students
- Providing clear, step-by-step instructions for procedures while leaving conceptual questions open
- Using demonstrations rather than student practicals when the learning focus is conceptual rather than procedural

#### The IDEA Approach

Millar's research underpins the **IDEA** approach to practical work:
- **I**nvestigation: Open-ended enquiry where students design and carry out their own investigations
- **D**emonstration: Teacher-led demonstrations with student prediction and discussion
- **E**xercise: Structured practicals focused on developing specific skills
- **A**pplication: Practical work applying concepts to new contexts

Different types of practical serve different purposes, and teachers should be intentional about which type they use for each learning objective.

### Impact on Curriculum and Assessment

Millar's work on practical work has influenced:

- The Twenty First Century Science specifications, which distinguish carefully between different types of practical activity
- Ofsted's approach to inspecting science practical work, with greater attention to learning outcomes
- Teacher education programmes, which increasingly emphasise purposeful practical design
- The development of the **Required Practical** approach in England's GCSE specifications, which specifies particular practicals while allowing flexibility in how they are taught

## Assessment and Diagnostic Teaching

### Diagnostic Questions

Millar has been a leading proponent of **diagnostic assessment** in science education. Recognising that students come to science lessons with pre-existing ideas—often misconceptions—that influence how they interpret new learning, Millar developed approaches to identifying these ideas quickly and efficiently.

Diagnostic questions are carefully designed multiple-choice items where each incorrect answer corresponds to a common misconception. By analysing patterns of responses across a class, teachers can:
- Identify prevalent misconceptions before teaching a topic
- Target instruction to address specific student difficulties
- Monitor whether interventions have been successful
- Adapt teaching in real-time based on student responses

### The Properties of Matter Project

One of Millar's major research projects focused on students' understanding of the properties of matter, particularly the particulate theory of matter. This research revealed that:

- Many students hold **continuum models** of matter even after instruction in particle theory
- Students often confuse the properties of individual particles with the properties of substances
- Understanding of the particulate nature of matter develops slowly and requires sustained attention
- Practical activities alone are insufficient to develop particle theory understanding

These findings have shaped both curriculum materials and teaching approaches, with greater attention now given to developing particle theory gradually and explicitly addressing common misconceptions.

### Implications for Classroom Practice

Millar's work on assessment emphasises that effective science teaching requires:

- **Prior knowledge assessment**: Finding out what students already think before teaching new content
- **Formative use of summative assessments**: Using test data diagnostically rather than just for grading
- **Feedback that addresses misconceptions**: Not just indicating right/wrong but explaining why wrong answers are incorrect
- **Teaching as responsive activity**: Adapting instruction based on emerging evidence of student understanding

## Contributions to Physics Education

### Conceptually Demanding Physics Topics

Given his background as a physics teacher, Millar has maintained a particular interest in the teaching and learning of physics. His research has focused on topics that students typically find difficult, including:

#### Electric Circuits

Millar's doctoral student Joan Borg Marks conducted influential research on students' understanding of electric circuits (2012). This work built on Millar's earlier research showing that:

- Students often use **sequential reasoning** (current gets used up as it goes round the circuit) rather than simultaneous reasoning
- The concept of voltage is particularly difficult, often conflated with current
- Practical work with circuits can reinforce misconceptions if not carefully designed
- Abstract models need to be carefully linked to concrete circuit behaviour

#### Energy

Millar has written extensively on the teaching of energy, arguing that the concept is often taught in ways that obscure its scientific meaning. His work contributed to the 2014 book *Teaching and Learning of Energy in K-12 Education*, where he argued for:

- Clear distinction between energy as a quantitative, calculable quantity and everyday uses of the term
- Teaching energy transfer and transformation explicitly rather than assuming students will infer these ideas
- Greater attention to the **degradation** of energy (the second law of thermodynamics) alongside conservation
- Avoiding misleading metaphors (such as energy being 'used up' or 'wasted') that conflict with scientific understanding

#### Forces and Motion

Millar's research has documented the persistence of **Aristotelian intuitions** about force and motion even after Newtonian instruction. Students commonly believe that:
- Force is needed to maintain motion (rather than to change it)
- Heavier objects fall faster
- Objects stop because they run out of force

Millar's work has shown that these ideas are remarkably resistant to change and that effective teaching must explicitly confront and challenge them, rather than simply presenting the correct scientific view.

## The Research-Practice Interface

### Evidence-Based Practice in Science Education (EPSE)

Millar was coordinator of the **Evidence-based Practice in Science Education (EPSE) Research Network**, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) as part of its Teaching and Learning Research Programme. This network brought together researchers and teachers to explore how research evidence could more effectively influence classroom practice.

The EPSE network addressed questions including:
- How do teachers access and use research evidence?
- What forms of research communication are most effective?
- How can research evidence be synthesised for practitioner use?
- What are the barriers to research-informed practice?

Millar's work in this area emphasised that research cannot simply be 'applied' to practice; rather, teachers must interpret and adapt research insights for their specific contexts.

### Improving the Research-Practice Interface

In a 2009 paper, Millar explored why research has often had limited impact on practice, identifying several factors:

- **Scale and complexity**: Educational research findings are often tentative, context-dependent, and contested
- **Teacher professionalism**: Teachers make professional judgments based on multiple factors, not just research evidence
- **System constraints**: Curriculum specifications, assessment regimes, and resource limitations constrain what teachers can do
- **Communication gaps**: Research is often published in forms inaccessible to busy practitioners

Millar advocated for:
- Research-informed teaching materials that embed research insights in usable resources
- Sustained professional development rather than one-off 'research dissemination' events
- Teacher engagement in research, not just as recipients but as partners
- Realistic expectations about what research can achieve

### The UYSEG Approach

Through the University of York Science Education Group, Millar pioneered an approach to curriculum development that directly connects research with classroom practice. The UYSEG model involves:

- Research to identify learning difficulties and effective approaches
- Design of teaching materials based on research insights
- Pilot testing in schools with detailed evaluation
- Revision based on evidence from piloting
- Wider dissemination with continuing support for teachers

This model has been influential in demonstrating that research-informed curriculum development is both possible and effective.

## Legacy and Continuing Influence

Robin Millar's contribution to science education extends far beyond his individual research studies. He has:

- **Reframed the purpose of school science**: From preparation for further study to preparation for citizenship
- **Developed influential curricula**: Twenty First Century Science has reached hundreds of thousands of students
- **Challenged assumptions about practical work**: Demonstrating that practical work is neither necessary nor sufficient for learning
- **Promoted diagnostic assessment**: Providing teachers with tools to understand and respond to student thinking
- **Modelled research-informed practice**: Showing how educational research can shape classroom teaching

For teachers in England and beyond, Millar's work provides both theoretical frameworks and practical tools for improving science education. His emphasis on scientific literacy, purposeful practical work, and diagnostic teaching continues to shape how science is taught in schools today.

## Pedagogical Implications for the Classroom

### For Early Career Teachers

Millar's work offers early career science teachers a research-informed foundation for their practice:

- **Question assumed practices**: Don't do practical work just because it has always been done; consider what it achieves
- **Start with student thinking**: Use diagnostic questions to find out what students already believe before teaching
- **Focus on understanding**: Prioritise depth of understanding over coverage of content
- **Connect science to students' lives**: Help students see the relevance of science to their everyday experiences

### For Curriculum Leaders

Department leaders can draw on Millar's work to:

- **Audit the curriculum**: Does it serve the needs of all students, not just future scientists?
- **Review practical provision**: Are practical activities purposeful and effective?
- **Develop assessment practices**: Is assessment used formatively to inform teaching?
- **Build research engagement**: How can the department connect with educational research?

### For Senior Leaders

School leaders should note Millar's evidence that:

- Science for citizenship is academically rigorous, not a 'soft' option
- Effective practical work requires investment in teacher development, not just equipment
- Reducing content coverage can improve learning outcomes
- Research-informed practice requires sustained support, not one-off training

## Conclusion

Robin Millar represents a distinctive and influential tradition in British science education: the teacher-researcher who combines practical classroom experience with rigorous research and uses both to shape curriculum and policy. From his early work on students' understanding of physics concepts through the landmark Beyond 2000 report to his ongoing contributions to PISA, Millar has consistently argued that science education should serve all students, not just future scientists.

His work on practical work effectiveness has challenged comfortable assumptions and prompted significant rethinking of how laboratory work is used in schools. The Twenty First Century Science suite demonstrates that research-informed curriculum development can operate at scale, reaching hundreds of thousands of students.

For teachers today, Millar's legacy is a reminder that effective science teaching requires both subject knowledge and pedagogical understanding, that research can inform practice, and that the ultimate purpose of school science is to prepare young people to engage thoughtfully with the scientific issues they will encounter as citizens.
