## Biography and Career Trajectory

### Early Academic Foundation

Wynne Harlen's academic journey began with doctoral research at the University of Bristol, where she developed her early interest in assessment procedures in science education. Her PhD work laid the foundation for what would become a lifelong commitment to understanding how children learn science and how teachers can effectively support that learning through appropriate assessment strategies.

### Research Career Development

Following her doctoral studies, Harlen spent four years as a researcher at Reading University, where she began developing her expertise in science education research. In 1977, she moved to London University, where she served as Deputy Director of the Assessment of Performance Unit (APU) science project from 1977 to 1985. The APU was a significant national assessment programme that sought to monitor educational standards across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Harlen's involvement in the APU science project provided her with invaluable experience in large-scale educational assessment and deepened her understanding of how children perform across different scientific domains.

Concurrent with her APU work, Harlen served as Director of the Centre for Science and Mathematics Education at London University from 1977 to 1985. This dual role positioned her at the intersection of assessment research and science education development, allowing her to integrate insights from both fields.

### Professorship at Liverpool

In 1985, Harlen left London to join the University of Liverpool as Professor of Science Education. During her tenure at Liverpool, she directed the landmark SPACE (Science Processes and Concept Exploration) project, which would become one of the most influential research programmes in primary science education. The SPACE project, conducted jointly with King's College London and directed alongside Paul Black, represented a paradigm shift in how researchers and educators understood children's scientific thinking.

### Leadership in Scottish Education

Following her work at Liverpool, Harlen assumed the role of Director of the Scottish Council for Research in Education (SCRE). This position placed her at the forefront of educational research in Scotland and provided her with opportunities to influence policy and practice across the Scottish education system. During this period, she continued her research and writing, cementing her reputation as a leading international authority on primary science education.

### Later Career and Continued Influence

Upon retiring from her directorship at SCRE, Harlen became a Visiting Professor at the University of Bristol's Graduate School of Education, maintaining her connections to the academic community while continuing to write and consult internationally.

## The SPACE Project: A Paradigm Shift in Primary Science

### Origins and Methodology

The Science Processes and Concept Exploration (SPACE) project began in the mid-1980s, just ahead of the introduction of the National Curriculum in England and Wales. Conducted jointly at the University of Liverpool and King's College London, with Wynne Harlen and Paul Black as co-directors, the project represented a systematic attempt to investigate children's understanding of scientific concepts across the primary age range.

The SPACE research employed a distinctive methodology that has influenced subsequent science education research internationally. Rather than simply testing whether children could recall scientific facts, the project sought to elicit children's own ideas about scientific phenomena through structured interviews and classroom-based investigations. Researchers worked closely with teachers to develop and refine techniques for exploring children's thinking, creating a model of collaborative research that bridged the gap between academic research and classroom practice.

### Scope and Publications

Between 1990 and 1998, the SPACE project published a series of research reports through Liverpool University Press, each focusing on a specific scientific concept area. The reports covered:

- **Light** (1990): Investigating children's understanding of light, shadows, vision, and colour
- **Materials** (1991): Exploring children's ideas about properties, changes, and classification of materials
- **Electricity** (1991): Examining understanding of circuits, current, and electrical phenomena
- **Forces** (1990s): Investigating concepts of force, motion, and equilibrium
- **Sound** (1990s): Exploring understanding of sound production, transmission, and pitch
- **Earth in Space** (1990s): Examining astronomical concepts and Earth-based phenomena
- **Life Processes** (1990s): Investigating understanding of living things and biological processes

Each report followed a consistent structure, presenting the research methodology, findings about children's ideas at different ages, and implications for teaching. This systematic approach allowed teachers to access research findings in an accessible format directly relevant to their classroom practice.

### Key Findings and Their Significance

The SPACE research revealed several crucial insights about children's scientific understanding that have fundamentally shaped primary science pedagogy:

**Prior Knowledge Matters**: The research consistently demonstrated that children enter science lessons with existing ideas about natural phenomena—ideas that may be partial, alternative, or sometimes at odds with accepted scientific understanding. Rather than being "empty vessels" waiting to be filled with scientific knowledge, children were shown to be active constructors of meaning based on their everyday experiences.

**Developmental Progression**: The project identified patterns in how children's ideas develop across the primary years. While not strictly age-dependent, certain ways of thinking about scientific phenomena were found to be more common at particular stages, providing teachers with guidance about what to expect and how to support progression.

**The Importance of Elicitation**: A central methodology of the SPACE project was the careful elicitation of children's ideas before, during, and after teaching. This approach demonstrated that understanding what children already think is essential for designing effective instruction that addresses misconceptions and builds on existing understanding.

**Conceptual Challenges**: The research identified specific conceptual obstacles that children commonly encounter. For example, many children struggle with the idea that light travels from a source to the eye (rather than from the eye to objects), or that electric current is not "used up" as it passes through components in a circuit. Understanding these predictable difficulties has helped teachers anticipate and address them proactively.

### Legacy of the SPACE Project

Writing in *Primary Science Review* in 2007, Harlen reflected on the SPACE legacy twenty-one years after the project began. She noted that the project's influence extended far beyond its immediate research findings, establishing a model for investigating children's ideas that has been replicated and adapted internationally. The SPACE reports remain valuable resources for primary science educators, and the project's methodology continues to inform research into children's scientific understanding.

The project's findings directly influenced the development of the National Curriculum for Science in England, ensuring that curriculum expectations were grounded in research evidence about what children can reasonably be expected to understand at different ages. More broadly, the SPACE project established the importance of "starting from where children are" as a fundamental principle of effective science teaching.

## Formative Assessment and Assessment for Learning

### Reconceptualising Assessment

Throughout her career, Wynne Harlen has been a leading advocate for formative assessment—assessment designed to support learning rather than simply measure it. Her work in this area has helped shift understanding of assessment from a summative, judgmental activity to an integral part of the teaching and learning process.

Harlen's approach to formative assessment is rooted in her research on children's ideas. She argues that effective formative assessment begins with understanding what children already know and think. Teachers who know their pupils' starting points can design instruction that builds on existing understanding, addresses misconceptions, and moves children towards more scientifically accurate conceptualisations.

### Key Publications on Assessment

Harlen's contributions to assessment literature include several influential books:

**"Assessment of Learning" (2006)**: In this seminal work, Harlen explored the relationship between summative and formative assessment, arguing that the two purposes need not be in conflict. She demonstrated how assessment of learning (summative) can be compatible with assessment for learning (formative) when both are grounded in clear understanding of learning goals and criteria for success.

The book addresses practical questions facing teachers: how to gather evidence of children's understanding during lessons, how to use questioning effectively to probe thinking, how to provide feedback that moves learning forward, and how to involve children in assessing their own and others' work. Throughout, Harlen maintains a focus on assessment as a tool for improving learning outcomes rather than merely measuring them.

**"Teaching Science for Understanding in Elementary and Middle Schools"**: This book dedicates significant attention to formative assessment as "a framework for discussion on how to help students develop their understanding, enquiry skills and positive attitudes to scientific investigation." Harlen integrates assessment throughout her discussion of teaching strategies, treating it not as a separate activity but as an essential component of effective science instruction.

### Formative Assessment in Practice

Harlen's work on formative assessment emphasises several key principles:

**Taking Children's Ideas Seriously**: Building on her SPACE research, Harlen argues that formative assessment must begin with genuine curiosity about what children think. This requires creating classroom environments where children feel safe to express their ideas, even when those ideas are tentative or unconventional.

**The Role of Questioning**: Harlen has written extensively about the importance of teacher questioning in formative assessment. She distinguishes between questions that simply check recall and questions that probe understanding, encouraging teachers to use "the right question at the right time" to elicit and develop children's thinking.

**Feedback That Moves Learning Forward**: Effective feedback, in Harlen's formulation, provides children with information they can use to improve their work. This goes beyond simple praise or grades to specific guidance about how to develop understanding further.

**Peer and Self-Assessment**: Harlen advocates for involving children in the assessment process through peer and self-assessment activities. These approaches not only reduce teacher workload but also help children develop metacognitive awareness and take ownership of their learning.

### Impact on Policy and Practice

Harlen's work on assessment has influenced policy documents and curriculum frameworks nationally and internationally. Her advocacy for assessment for learning has contributed to broader movements that recognise the limitations of over-reliance on high-stakes testing and emphasise the value of classroom-based formative assessment.

## Big Ideas of Science Education

### Developing the Framework

In 2010, Wynne Harlen led an international group of science educators to develop a framework identifying the fundamental principles and "big ideas" of science education. Published by the Association for Science Education (ASE), "Principles and Big Ideas of Science Education" has become an influential document shaping curriculum development and science teaching internationally.

The project brought together contributors from across the world, including Derek Bell, Rosa Devés, Hubert Dyasi, Guillermo Fernández de la Garza, Pierre Léna, Robin Millar, Michael Reiss, Patricia Rowell, and Wei Yu. This international collaboration ensured that the resulting framework reflected diverse educational contexts while identifying core principles relevant across national boundaries.

### The Ten Big Ideas

The framework identifies ten "big ideas" of science that constitute the essential understanding all students should develop through their science education:

1. **All material in the Universe is made of very small particles**: This big idea encompasses atomic theory and the particulate nature of matter, fundamental to understanding chemistry and physics.

2. **Objects can affect other objects at a distance**: Addressing forces, fields, and interactions that do not require physical contact, this idea spans gravitational, magnetic, and electrostatic phenomena.

3. **Changing the movement of an object requires a net force to be acting on it**: This Newtonian principle underpins understanding of motion and dynamics.

4. **The total amount of energy in the Universe is always the same but can be transferred from place to place and transformed**: The principle of conservation of energy, including understanding of energy transfers and transformations.

5. **The composition of the Earth and its atmosphere and the processes occurring within them shape the Earth's surface and its climate**: Integrating geological, atmospheric, and environmental science.

6. **Our solar system is a very small part of one of billions of galaxies in the Universe**: Providing cosmic perspective and understanding of astronomical scales.

7. **Organisms are organised on a cellular basis**: The cell as the fundamental unit of life, underpinning biological understanding.

8. **Organisms require a supply of energy and materials for which they are dependent on or compete with other organisms**: Ecological relationships and the flow of energy and matter through ecosystems.

9. **Genetic information is passed down from one generation of organisms to another**: Heredity, DNA, and the mechanisms of inheritance.

10. **The diversity of organisms, living and extinct, is the result of evolution**: Darwinian evolution as the unifying framework for understanding biological diversity.

In addition to these ten big ideas of science, the framework identifies four "big ideas about science"—understanding of the nature of scientific enquiry, scientific evidence, scientific explanations, and the relationship between science and society.

### Implications for Curriculum Design

The big ideas framework has significant implications for how science curricula are structured. Rather than presenting science as a collection of discrete topics, Harlen's approach emphasises the interconnected nature of scientific understanding. The big ideas provide coherence across the curriculum, helping students see how different topics relate to fundamental principles.

The framework also has implications for progression. Harlen argues that big ideas should be introduced early in simple forms and revisited repeatedly with increasing sophistication as students develop. This spiral curriculum approach ensures that learning builds cumulatively towards genuine understanding rather than accumulating isolated facts.

### International Influence

The "Principles and Big Ideas" framework has been adopted and adapted by science educators internationally. Research published in *Research in Science & Technological Education* (2021) examined how teachers in Chile engaged with creating and teaching big ideas of science education based on Harlen's framework, demonstrating the document's international reach and influence.

A follow-up publication, "Working with Big Ideas of Science Education" (edited by Harlen), provided further guidance for teachers and curriculum developers on implementing the big ideas approach in practice.

## Teaching Science for Understanding

### Core Principles

Harlen's book "Teaching Science for Understanding in Elementary and Middle Schools" (2015) distils her career's insights into practical guidance for teachers. The book focuses on "why developing understanding is essential in science education and how best to engage students in activities that deepen their curiosity about the world and promote enjoyment of science."

The book is structured around key aspects of science teaching, each addressing a crucial component of effective practice:

**Taking Students' Ideas Seriously**: Building on SPACE research, this section addresses how teachers can elicit, value, and work with children's existing ideas. Harlen provides practical strategies for creating classroom environments where children feel safe to express their thinking and where teachers can gain genuine insight into children's understanding.

**Teachers' and Students' Questions**: Harlen explores the role of questioning in science education, distinguishing between teacher questions that probe understanding and strategies for helping students develop their own questions. She emphasises that genuine scientific inquiry begins with curiosity and the formulation of investigable questions.

**Planning and Conducting Inquiries**: The book provides detailed guidance on supporting students through the complete inquiry process—from raising questions and planning investigations through gathering, analysing, and interpreting information to communicating findings and reflecting on learning.

**Formative Assessment Integration**: Throughout the book, Harlen integrates formative assessment as an essential component of teaching for understanding. Rather than treating assessment as separate from instruction, she demonstrates how ongoing assessment informs teaching decisions and supports student learning.

### Classroom Applications

The book is notable for its practical, classroom-based approach. Harlen draws on extensive classroom examples to illustrate her principles in action. Teachers reading the book find specific strategies they can implement immediately, alongside the theoretical rationale that supports those strategies.

Harlen's guidance addresses the realities of classroom teaching: mixed-ability groups, time constraints, resource limitations, and the pressure of curriculum coverage. Her advice is grounded in what is achievable in real classrooms while maintaining aspiration for high-quality science education.

### Emphasis on Enjoyment and Engagement

A distinctive feature of Harlen's approach is her emphasis on enjoyment as an essential component of science education. She argues that developing understanding is not merely a cognitive achievement but is supported by positive attitudes and genuine engagement with scientific phenomena. Her guidance helps teachers create science lessons that children find meaningful, interesting, and enjoyable.

### ASE Guide to Primary Science Education

Wynne Harlen edited "The ASE Guide to Primary Science Education," published by the Association for Science Education. This comprehensive handbook, first published in 2005 and subsequently updated, serves as a key resource for primary science coordinators and teachers.

The guide covers all aspects of primary science education, from subject knowledge and curriculum organisation to assessment, resources, and health and safety. Harlen's editorial direction ensured that the content was research-informed and practically applicable, bringing together contributions from leading science educators to create a definitive reference work.

The guide reflects Harlen's characteristic balance of rigour and accessibility. Complex research findings are presented in ways that busy teachers can understand and apply, while maintaining fidelity to the underlying evidence.

### Ongoing Collaboration

Harlen's relationship with the ASE has been sustained throughout her career. The Association has published several of her major works, including "Principles and Big Ideas of Science Education" and related materials. This collaboration has ensured that her research reaches the practitioner audience who can implement her recommendations in classrooms.

The ASE's commitment to evidence-informed practice aligns with Harlen's approach, making the organisation a natural home for her publications. Her work has appeared in the Association's journals, including *Primary Science Review*, where she has contributed articles reflecting on developments in primary science education.

## Key Themes Across Harlen's Work

### Taking Children's Ideas Seriously

A unifying thread throughout Harlen's career has been her insistence that effective science education must begin with understanding what children already think. From the SPACE research through to her most recent publications, she has consistently argued that teaching which ignores children's existing ideas is unlikely to succeed
