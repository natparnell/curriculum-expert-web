# Rosalind Driver: Constructivism and Children's Ideas in Science

## Biography and Academic Background

### Early Life and Education

Rosalind Driver (1941–1997) was one of the most influential science education researchers of the twentieth century. Born in 1941, Driver pursued her passion for science and education through rigorous academic training that would eventually position her at the forefront of the constructivist movement in science education. Her early career included teaching science in secondary schools, an experience that profoundly shaped her understanding of the challenges facing science educators and the complexities of student learning.

### The University of Leeds and Formation of the CLIS Project

Driver joined the University of Leeds in the late 1970s, where she established herself as a pioneering researcher in science education. In 1982, she founded the **Children's Learning in Science Project (CLIS)** at the Centre for Studies in Science and Mathematics Education (CSSME), which would become one of the most significant research initiatives in science education globally. The Centre at Leeds became an international hub for research into teaching and learning scientific conceptual knowledge, with Driver's work influencing generations of researchers and practitioners.

During her tenure at Leeds, Driver rose to the position of **Professor of Science Education**, a role in which she directed numerous research projects, supervised doctoral students, and collaborated with teachers and local education authorities. Her work at Leeds continued until her untimely death in 1997, leaving behind a substantial body of research that continues to inform science education theory and practice today.

### Collaborations and the Leeds Research Community

Driver's work was characterised by extensive collaboration with colleagues who would themselves become significant figures in science education research. She worked closely with researchers including **John Leach**, **Philip Scott**, **Hilary Asoko**, **Eduardo Mortimer**, and **Valerie Oldham**. These collaborations resulted in seminal publications that advanced understanding of how students learn science and how teachers can support conceptual development.

The Leeds research community under Driver's leadership became known for its commitment to both theoretical rigour and practical classroom application. The CLIS Project specifically involved partnerships between university researchers and practicing teachers, with over 30 teachers from the Yorkshire region working collaboratively with the research team between 1984 and 1986 to develop and test teaching schemes.

## Theoretical Foundations: Constructivism in Science Education

### The Constructivist View of Learning

Driver was instrumental in introducing and developing constructivist theory within science education. Drawing on the work of **Jean Piaget**, **David Ausubel**, and other cognitive psychologists, Driver articulated a view of learning as an active, ongoing process in which students construct their own interpretations and meanings of information based on their existing knowledge and experiences.

In her highly influential 1994 paper "Constructing Scientific Knowledge in the Classroom" (co-authored with Hilary Asoko, John Leach, Philip Scott, and Eduardo Mortimer), Driver distinguished between **personal constructivism** and **social constructivism**. Personal constructivism focuses on how individual learners make sense of their experiences and construct mental representations of the world. Social constructivism emphasises the role of language, social interaction, and cultural contexts in the construction of knowledge.

Driver argued that effective science education must attend to both dimensions. Students construct understandings based on their individual experiences, but these constructions are shaped by the scientific concepts, language, and practices of the broader scientific community. The classroom, in this view, is not simply a place where teachers transmit established scientific knowledge to passive students, but rather a community of practice where scientific understanding is actively constructed through investigation, discussion, and reflection.

### Alternative Frameworks: Understanding Students' Prior Ideas

A cornerstone of Driver's contribution to science education is her research into students' **alternative conceptions** or **alternative frameworks**—the ideas that children develop about natural phenomena before receiving formal science instruction. Driver demonstrated through extensive empirical research that children are not blank slates when they enter science classrooms; rather, they arrive with well-developed, coherent (though often scientifically incorrect) ideas about how the world works.

In her seminal 1983 book *The Pupil as Scientist?*, Driver presented evidence that children develop sophisticated alternative frameworks through their everyday experiences. For example:

- **Force and motion**: Many children believe that continuous motion requires continuous force, an idea that aligns with intuitive experience but conflicts with Newtonian physics.
- **Heat and temperature**: Children often conflate heat and temperature, or believe that heat is a substance that flows from hot to cold objects.
- **Particle theory**: Students frequently hold that matter is continuous rather than particulate, or that particles expand when heated rather than the space between them increasing.
- **Plant nutrition**: Many children believe that plants obtain their food from the soil rather than through photosynthesis.

Driver argued that these alternative frameworks are not simply random errors or misconceptions but represent coherent, alternative ways of understanding phenomena that have been developed over extended periods through interaction with the physical world. This insight has profound implications for teaching: if students' prior ideas are coherent and well-established, they cannot be simply replaced by telling students the "correct" scientific view.

### Conceptual Change and the Status of Scientific Knowledge

Building on research into alternative frameworks, Driver developed theoretical models of **conceptual change**—the processes through which learners transform their existing ideas into more scientifically acceptable understandings. Driver recognised that conceptual change is difficult because alternative frameworks are often deeply entrenched, useful in everyday contexts, and emotionally connected to learners' identities.

Driver distinguished between different types of conceptual change:

- **Assimilation**: New information is incorporated into existing conceptual structures without fundamental change to those structures.
- **Accommodation**: Existing conceptual structures are modified or reorganised to accommodate new information that cannot be assimilated.
- **Rad restructuring**: Fundamental reorganisation of conceptual frameworks, often requiring changes to ontological categories (e.g., understanding heat as energy transfer rather than as a substance).

Driver emphasised that conceptual change in science education requires more than cognitive restructuring; it involves developing an understanding of the nature of scientific knowledge, the role of evidence and explanation in science, and the epistemological status of scientific concepts. Students need to understand not just *what* scientists believe, but *why* they believe it and *how* scientific knowledge is constructed and validated.

## The Children's Learning in Science Project (CLIS)

### Origins and Aims

The **Children's Learning in Science Project (CLIS)**, established by Driver in 1982, was a multi-phase research initiative that investigated children's ideas about science and developed constructivist teaching approaches. The project received funding from the UK Department of Education and Science and operated from the Centre for Studies in Science and Mathematics Education at the University of Leeds.

The CLIS Project had three main aims:

1. **To investigate children's science in a range of curriculum topics**, documenting the ideas that students hold before and during instruction.
2. **To develop constructivist teaching schemes** that would enable students to develop more scientifically acceptable understandings.
3. **To translate research findings into practical materials** that could be used by teachers beyond the research team.

### Phase 1: Researching Children's Ideas (1982–1984)

The initial phase of CLIS focused on empirical research into students' ideas across key science topics. Using clinical interview methods, written surveys, and classroom observation, the research team documented the alternative conceptions held by students aged 10–16. This research revealed the systematic nature of children's ideas and their persistence despite traditional instruction.

Key findings from this phase included:

- Students hold remarkably consistent alternative conceptions within and across age groups.
- These conceptions often align with historical scientific ideas (e.g., impetus theories of motion similar to medieval physics).
- Traditional teaching methods that simply present the correct scientific view are largely ineffective at producing conceptual change.
- Students' ideas are often context-dependent, with different conceptions activated in different situations.

### Phase 2: Developing Teaching Schemes (1984–1987)

The second phase of CLIS involved collaboration with practising teachers to develop and test teaching schemes based on constructivist principles. Between 1984 and 1986, over 30 teachers from the Yorkshire region worked with the research team to develop schemes in three key areas:

- **Energy**
- **Particle theory (particulate nature of matter)**
- **Plant nutrition**

These teaching schemes were designed to follow a **constructivist teaching sequence**:

1. **Orientation**: Engage students with a phenomenon or problem that makes their thinking relevant.
2. **Elicitation**: Provide opportunities for students to express their existing ideas through discussion, prediction, or drawing.
3. **Restructuring**: Support students in exploring the limitations of their existing ideas and developing new understandings through investigation, discussion, and exposure to alternative viewpoints.
4. **Application**: Enable students to apply their new understandings to novel situations.
5. **Review**: Encourage reflection on how ideas have changed and the evidence supporting new understandings.

The CLIS teaching schemes were extensively trialled in classrooms, with researchers and teachers working together to refine materials based on observation and student outcomes. This collaborative action research approach was innovative and produced materials that were both theoretically grounded and practically viable.

### Phase 3: Dissemination and Impact (1987–1994)

The final phase of CLIS focused on disseminating findings and materials to the wider educational community. This included:

- Publication of teaching materials for teachers
- Development of teacher professional development programmes
- Presentation at conferences and in academic journals
- Publication of *Making Sense of Secondary Science* (1994)

The CLIS Project demonstrated that constructivist approaches could be implemented in ordinary classrooms with positive results for student learning. The project's influence extended far beyond the UK, informing science education reform efforts internationally.

## Key Publications

### *The Pupil as Scientist?* (1983)

Driver's first major book, *The Pupil as Scientist?*, published by Open University Press in 1983, established her as a leading voice in science education research. The book synthesised research on children's ideas in science and argued for a fundamental rethinking of science teaching based on constructivist principles.

The central argument of the book is captured in its provocative title: Driver challenged the assumption that pupils are simply junior scientists who, with appropriate instruction, will naturally arrive at correct scientific understandings. Instead, she demonstrated that children are active constructors of their own knowledge, building alternative frameworks that often differ substantially from accepted scientific views.

Key themes in *The Pupil as Scientist?* include:

- The systematic nature of children's alternative conceptions
- The origins of these conceptions in everyday experience
- The inadequacy of transmission-based teaching approaches
- The need for teaching strategies that engage with students' prior ideas
- The role of cognitive development in science learning

The book was practical in orientation, offering guidance for teachers on how to elicit and work with children's ideas. It has been widely used in initial teacher education and professional development programmes.

### *Children's Ideas in Science* (1985)

Co-edited with **Guesne** and **Tiberghien**, this edited collection brought together research on children's conceptions across the major areas of the science curriculum. The book documented the ideas that students hold about topics including:

- Light and vision
- Heat and temperature
- Force and motion
- Electricity
- The particulate nature of matter
- Living things and biological processes

Each chapter synthesised research findings and discussed implications for teaching. The book became a standard reference for science teachers and researchers, providing evidence-based guidance on what to expect from students and how to address common alternative conceptions.

### "A Constructivist Approach to Curriculum Development in Science" (1986)

This seminal paper, co-authored with **Valerie Oldham** and published in *Studies in Science Education*, articulated the theoretical foundations and practical principles of constructivist curriculum development. The paper outlined the CLIS approach and argued for curriculum development as a form of research, with teachers as active collaborators in generating knowledge about effective practice.

The paper introduced the **constructivist teaching sequence** that would become central to CLIS materials and influenced subsequent curriculum development internationally. It also addressed the challenges of implementing constructivist approaches, including the need for teacher professional development and the importance of appropriate assessment methods.

### *Making Sense of Secondary Science: Research into Children's Ideas* (1994)

This comprehensive volume, co-authored with **Ann Squires**, **Peter Rushworth**, and **Valerie Wood-Robinson**, represented the culmination of over a decade of CLIS research. Published by Routledge, the book provided detailed accounts of research into children's ideas across the secondary science curriculum, together with practical guidance for teachers.

The book was developed in collaboration with Leeds City Council Department of Education and included both the research synthesis and accompanying support materials for teachers. It has been widely used in the UK and internationally, with a second edition published as a Routledge Education Classic in 2014.

*Making Sense of Secondary Science* is organised around curriculum topics, with each chapter covering:

- The scientific concepts to be taught
- Research on students' prior conceptions
- Common alternative frameworks and their origins
- Teaching strategies to promote conceptual change
- Assessment approaches to probe understanding

### "Constructing Scientific Knowledge in the Classroom" (1994)

This influential paper, published in *Educational Researcher*, presented Driver's mature theoretical framework for understanding science learning and teaching. Co-authored with Hilary Asoko, John Leach, Philip Scott, and Eduardo Mortimer, the paper synthesised constructivist and sociocultural perspectives to present a comprehensive model of science education.

The paper distinguished between the **personal** and **social** aspects of science learning, arguing that students construct scientific knowledge through a process of enculturation into the practices and discourse of the scientific community. This framework has been highly influential in shaping subsequent research and curriculum development.

## Pedagogical Approaches and Teaching Strategies

### Eliciting Children's Ideas

A fundamental principle of Driver's approach is that effective science teaching must begin with understanding what students already think. Driver developed and advocated various strategies for **eliciting children's ideas**, including:

- **Prediction-observation-explanation (POE)**: Students predict what will happen in a demonstration, observe what actually happens, and then explain any discrepancies.
- **Concept cartoons**: Cartoons showing characters expressing different views about a scientific phenomenon, which students discuss and evaluate.
- **Draw and write**: Students create drawings and written explanations to reveal their thinking about scientific concepts.
- **Mind maps**: Students create diagrams showing connections between concepts.
- **Structured interviews**: One-to-one conversations in which students explain their thinking in depth.

Driver emphasised that elicitation is not a one-off activity but an ongoing process. Teachers need to create classroom environments where students feel safe to express their ideas, even when those ideas are incomplete or incorrect.

### The Constructivist Teaching Sequence

Building on elicitation, Driver advocated a **constructivist teaching sequence** designed to support conceptual change. This sequence involves:

#### Orientation
Create a need for learning by presenting phenomena that challenge students' existing ideas or raise questions that cannot be answered within their current frameworks. Orientation activities make students' prior knowledge relevant and create cognitive dissonance that motivates change.

#### Elicitation
Provide structured opportunities for students to articulate their existing ideas. This makes alternative frameworks explicit and available for examination, and communicates to students that their thinking is valued.

#### Restructuring
Support students in developing new understandings through:
- **Investigation**: Hands-on activities that generate evidence challenging alternative conceptions
- **Discussion**: Structured dialogue enabling students to compare ideas and evaluate evidence
- **Exposure to scientific models**: Introduction to accepted scientific views, with attention to how these models explain phenomena that alternative frameworks cannot
- **Cognitive conflict**: Experiences that directly challenge alternative conceptions and create a need for new ideas

#### Application
Provide opportunities for students to use their new understandings in varied contexts, consolidating learning and demonstrating the power of scientific models.

#### Review
Encourage metacognitive reflection on how ideas have changed, what evidence supports new understandings, and the nature of scientific knowledge.

### The Role of Talk and Social Interaction

Driver increasingly emphasised the social dimensions of science learning. Drawing on **Vygotskian** perspectives, she argued that scientific understanding develops through dialogue and interaction. Classroom talk serves multiple functions:

- Making thinking visible to teachers and peers
- Exposing students to alternative viewpoints
- Enabling the co-construction of understanding
- Supporting the development of scientific language and discourse practices
- Developing argumentation and reasoning skills

Driver advocated for **exploratory talk** in which students tentatively articulate ideas, respond to others, and jointly construct understanding. This contrasts with **presentational talk** (delivering established ideas) and requires careful teacher facilitation to create safe, productive discussion environments.

### Assessment for Understanding

Driver's constructivist perspective has significant implications for assessment. If students construct their own understandings, assessment must probe the nature of those understandings rather than simply checking recall of correct answers. Driver advocated:

- **Diagnostic assessment**: Probing students' ideas before instruction to inform teaching
- **Formative assessment**: Ongoing monitoring of understanding during instruction
- **Alternative assessment formats**: Using drawings, explanations, and practical tasks alongside conventional tests
- **Attention to reasoning**: Assessing not just what students think but how they justify their thinking

Driver's work has been influential in moving science education assessment beyond recall of facts toward deeper assessment of conceptual understanding and reasoning.

## Influence on Science Education Policy and Practice

### Impact on the UK National Curriculum

Driver's research significantly influenced the development and evolution of the **UK National Curriculum for Science**. The recognition that students construct their own understandings shaped curriculum specifications, particularly in the emphasis on:

- **Scientific enquiry**: The processes through which scientific knowledge is developed
- **Ideas and evidence**: Understanding the nature of scientific knowledge
- **Thinking skills**: Reasoning, explanation, and argumentation in science

The inclusion of **Sc1 (Scientific Enquiry)** as a distinct attainment target in the original National Curriculum reflected constructivist perspectives on science learning, though the implementation of this requirement has varied.

### Teacher Education and Professional Development

Driver's work has been central to science teacher education in the UK and internationally. Her books are standard texts on initial teacher education courses
