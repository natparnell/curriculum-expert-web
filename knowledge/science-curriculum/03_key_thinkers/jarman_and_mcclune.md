## Theoretical Framework: Scientific Literacy as Critical Engagement

### Redefining Scientific Literacy

Jarman and McClune approach scientific literacy not merely as the accumulation of scientific facts or the mastery of scientific procedures, but as **the capacity to engage critically with science in everyday contexts**. Their work responds to broader international debates about the purposes of science education, particularly the shift from preparing future scientists to educating scientifically literate citizens.

Drawing on and extending earlier conceptions of scientific literacy (particularly those of Jenkins, Millar, and Osborne), Jarman and McClune articulate a vision of scientific literacy that encompasses:

- **Understanding science content**: Foundational knowledge of key scientific concepts, principles, and processes
- **Understanding science enquiry**: Awareness of how scientific knowledge is constructed, validated, and contested
- **Understanding the interaction between science and society**: Recognition of how science relates to economic, political, ethical, and cultural dimensions of human experience
- **Critical engagement capabilities**: The skills and dispositions to evaluate science-related claims encountered in everyday life, particularly through media

This multidimensional conception aligns with what scholars have termed "Vision II" or "interactive" scientific literacy—literacy for citizenship rather than solely for professional scientific practice. Jarman and McClune's distinctive contribution has been to operationalise this vision through detailed attention to the specific competencies required to read science news critically.

### The Centrality of News Media

Jarman and McClune identify **science in the news** as a particularly important context for developing scientific literacy. Their rationale includes several interconnected arguments:

**Ubiquity and accessibility**: News media represent the primary source of scientific information for most adults. Studies consistently show that citizens encounter science far more frequently through newspapers, television, and online media than through formal education or direct engagement with scientific institutions.

**Relevance to citizenship**: Science-related news often addresses issues with significant societal implications—climate change, health crises, technological developments, environmental policies—that require informed citizen engagement. The ability to evaluate such news is therefore essential for democratic participation.

**Authenticity**: Unlike textbook science, which presents settled knowledge in simplified form, science news captures science as it actually unfolds—contested, uncertain, embedded in social and political contexts. This authenticity makes news both more challenging and more educationally valuable.

**Motivation and engagement**: Many students find science news intrinsically interesting because it connects to current events, controversies, and real-world applications. This interest can be leveraged to develop deeper scientific understanding and critical thinking skills.

## The Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes Framework

### Establishing a Comprehensive Framework

In their influential 2010 paper, "Critical Reading of Science-Based News Reports: Establishing a Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes Framework" (*International Journal of Science Education*), Jarman and McClune present a systematic analysis of what students need to know, be able to do, and believe in order to engage critically with science news. This framework emerged from extensive empirical research, including analysis of science news reports, interviews with journalists, and consultations with teachers and students.

The framework organises the prerequisites for critical reading into **five interconnected categories**:

### 1. Knowledge of Science

This domain encompasses the scientific subject matter that news reports address. Jarman and McClune identify several sub-components:

- **Conceptual knowledge**: Understanding of the scientific concepts, principles, and theories referenced in news stories
- **Procedural knowledge**: Awareness of scientific methods, including experimentation, observation, data analysis, and peer review
- **Knowledge of the nature of science**: Understanding that scientific knowledge is tentative, theory-laden, socially embedded, and shaped by human values and interests
- **Knowledge of scientific institutions**: Awareness of how scientific research is funded, conducted, validated, and communicated

Jarman and McClune note that students' existing scientific knowledge is often insufficient for critical engagement with news. School science typically presents simplified, decontextualised concepts, while news reports assume significant background knowledge and often address cutting-edge research beyond the school curriculum.

### 2. Knowledge of Writing and Language

Critical reading of science news requires understanding how language shapes meaning. This category includes:

- **Genre conventions**: Understanding the typical structures, styles, and purposes of news reporting, including the "inverted pyramid" structure, headline conventions, and the distinction between news, features, and opinion pieces
- **Linguistic features**: Awareness of how linguistic choices—such as modality, nominalisation, metaphor, and lexical selection—construct particular representations of science
- **Visual literacy**: Ability to interpret and critically evaluate diagrams, photographs, charts, and other visual elements that accompany news reports
- **Rhetorical strategies**: Recognition of how writers use evidence, authority, emotion, and other rhetorical appeals to persuade readers

Jarman and McClune emphasise that science news employs distinctive linguistic registers that blend scientific, journalistic, and everyday discourses. Students must navigate this hybridity to understand what is being communicated and how meaning is being constructed.

### 3. Knowledge About News, Newspapers, and Journalism

This domain addresses the media context within which science news is produced and consumed:

- **Journalistic practices**: Understanding how journalists identify, research, write, and edit stories, including the constraints of deadlines, word limits, and editorial policies
- **News values**: Awareness of the criteria—such as novelty, proximity, conflict, and human interest—that determine which scientific developments become news
- **Sources and gatekeeping**: Understanding how journalists select and use sources, and how this selection shapes what information reaches the public
- **Media ownership and economics**: Awareness of how commercial pressures, advertising considerations, and political orientations influence news content
- **Audience considerations**: Recognition that news is written for particular imagined audiences and that this shapes content, tone, and framing

Jarman and McClune argue that this "media awareness" dimension is often neglected in science education but is essential for understanding why science news takes the forms it does.

### 4. Skills

The framework identifies specific cognitive and practical competencies required for critical engagement:

**Comprehension skills**:
- Identifying main ideas and supporting details
- Distinguishing between facts, opinions, and speculations
- Recognising implicit assumptions and unstated premises
- Summarising and paraphrasing accurately

**Analysis skills**:
- Evaluating the credibility and authority of sources
- Assessing the quality and relevance of evidence presented
- Identifying logical fallacies and argumentative weaknesses
- Recognising bias, imbalance, and omission
- Comparing coverage across different media outlets

**Synthesis skills**:
- Connecting news content to prior knowledge and experience
- Relating science news to broader scientific, social, and ethical issues
- Evaluating the significance and implications of reported developments

**Evaluation skills**:
- Assessing the validity of scientific claims
- Judging the adequacy of explanations and interpretations
- Formulating reasoned opinions about science-related issues

### 5. Attitudes

Jarman and McClune emphasise that critical engagement is not purely cognitive but involves dispositions and orientations:

- **Interest in science and science news**: A genuine curiosity about scientific developments and their implications
- **Confidence in one's capacity to engage**: Self-efficacy beliefs that enable students to approach science news without intimidation
- **Critical stance**: A disposition to question, probe, and evaluate rather than passively accept information
- **Open-mindedness**: Willingness to consider multiple perspectives and revise one's views in light of evidence
- **Respect for evidence**: Commitment to basing judgments on reliable information and sound reasoning
- **Civic concern**: Recognition that science matters for personal and collective decision-making

The framework as a whole represents a comprehensive model of the educational outcomes required for critical engagement with science news. Jarman and McClune stress that these categories are interdependent: knowledge without skills produces passive understanding; skills without attitudes produce cynical dismissal rather than thoughtful evaluation.

## Pedagogical Approaches and Classroom Applications

### From Framework to Practice

Jarman and McClune's research has always been oriented toward practical classroom application. Their 2007 book *Developing Scientific Literacy* provides extensive guidance for teachers, including lesson ideas, resource suggestions, and strategies for scaffolding student learning. Key pedagogical principles include:

### Integrating News Media Systematically

Rather than treating news as an occasional enrichment activity, Jarman and McClune advocate for **systematic integration** of science news into the curriculum. This might include:

- Regular "science in the news" slots within science lessons
- Dedicated units or modules focused on media engagement
- Cross-curricular collaboration with English or citizenship departments
- Extended projects that involve sustained engagement with news topics

### Scaffolding Critical Reading

Recognising that critical engagement with science news is demanding, Jarman and McClune emphasise the importance of scaffolding. This includes:

- **Structured reading guides**: Templates and frameworks that direct students' attention to key features of news reports
- **Question sequences**: Progressive sets of questions that move from comprehension through analysis to evaluation
- **Comparative activities**: Exercises that involve comparing multiple reports of the same scientific development, highlighting how different sources frame the story
- **Collaborative discussion**: Group activities that expose students to diverse perspectives and reasoning strategies

### Developing Media Awareness

Jarman and McClune give particular attention to developing students' understanding of journalism and media production. Suggested activities include:

- Inviting journalists or science communicators to speak to classes
- Analysing how different newspapers cover the same story
- Exploring the relationship between press releases and news reports
- Investigating how news values shape science coverage
- Examining the role of headlines, images, and layout in constructing meaning

### Connecting to the Science Curriculum

While emphasising the distinctive nature of science news, Jarman and McClune also stress the importance of connecting media work to formal science content. Science news can:

- Illustrate the relevance and application of curriculum concepts
- Provide contexts for investigating the nature of science
- Support understanding of science-society interactions
- Motivate engagement with challenging scientific content

## The Science Newswise Resources

### Practical Resources for Teachers

Through their collaboration with the Association for Science Education (ASE), Jarman and McClune developed **Science Newswise** (2005) and **Science Newswise 2** (2011)—practical resources designed to support teachers in using newspapers in the science classroom. These materials were developed with funding from the Northern Ireland Integrated Education Fund and Belfast City Council, and have been widely distributed to schools.

The Science Newswise resources include:

- **Collections of science news articles**: Curated selections of newspaper reports covering diverse scientific topics
- **Teacher guidance**: Notes on how to use news articles effectively, including suggested questions, discussion prompts, and extension activities
- **Student worksheets**: Structured activities that scaffold critical reading and analysis
- **Background information**: Explanations of the scientific concepts and media issues relevant to selected articles
- **Assessment guidance**: Suggestions for evaluating students' developing critical engagement capabilities

These resources exemplify Jarman and McClune's commitment to bridging research and practice, translating their theoretical framework into usable classroom materials.

## Research Methods and Evidence Base

### Empirical Foundations

Jarman and McClune's work is grounded in extensive empirical research employing diverse methodologies:

**Content analysis**: Systematic analysis of science news reports to identify patterns in coverage, linguistic features, and representations of science. This research has documented how science news constructs particular images of scientific activity, often emphasising controversy, breakthrough, and novelty while underplaying the incremental, contested nature of scientific knowledge production.

**Interviews and ethnography**: Engagement with journalists, editors, and science communicators to understand the production of science news. This work has illuminated the constraints, pressures, and professional norms that shape how scientific developments become news stories.

**Classroom research**: Observation and evaluation of teaching interventions designed to develop students' critical engagement capabilities. Studies have documented both the challenges students face when engaging with science news and the progress they can make with appropriate instruction.

**Student and teacher surveys**: Large-scale surveys investigating the extent and nature of news media use in science classrooms, identifying barriers to implementation and factors associated with successful integration.

This empirical base has enabled Jarman and McClune to develop frameworks and recommendations that are both theoretically grounded and practically applicable.

## Critiques and Limitations

### Scholarly Debates

While influential, Jarman and McClune's work has also been subject to critique and debate:

**Complexity and feasibility**: Some educators argue that the knowledge, skills, and attitudes framework, while comprehensive, presents an unrealistically demanding picture of what can be achieved within the constraints of school science education. The breadth of knowledge and sophistication of skills required for fully critical engagement may exceed what is possible for many students.

**Digital media**: Much of Jarman and McClune's research focused on traditional print media. While their frameworks are applicable to digital environments, subsequent scholars have explored how online media, social media, and multimedia formats present distinctive challenges and opportunities that may require modified approaches.

**Assessment challenges**: Assessing the complex capabilities involved in critical engagement with science news remains difficult. Standardised assessments tend to focus on more easily measurable scientific knowledge, potentially marginalising the media engagement dimensions that Jarman and McClune emphasise.

**Cultural specificity**: Jarman and McClune's research has been conducted primarily in the United Kingdom context. While their frameworks have international relevance, the specific features of science news and journalism vary across media systems and cultures.

Jarman and McClune themselves acknowledge these challenges and have continued to develop their work in response to changing media landscapes and educational contexts.
