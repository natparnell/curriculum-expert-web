# Sir John Holman: STEM Education Policy, Practical Science, and Career Guidance

## Biography and Academic Background

Sir John Holman is an Emeritus Professor of Chemistry at the University of York and one of the most influential figures in UK science education policy over the past three decades. His career spans classroom teaching, headship, curriculum development, and national policy advisory roles. Born into an academic tradition, Holman trained as a chemist before dedicating his professional life to improving science education at every level—from primary classrooms to government policy chambers.

Holman's appointment as Headmaster of Watford Grammar School for Boys in the 1990s gave him crucial insight into school leadership and the practical challenges facing headteachers. This experience would later inform his policy work, ensuring his recommendations remained grounded in the realities of school life. In 1999, he left headship to join the University of York's Science Education Group, where he became director of the pioneering Salters Advanced Chemistry programme and helped establish York as a global centre for science education research and development.

His knighthood in 2010 recognised services to education, cementing his status as a leading voice in UK STEM policy. Throughout his career, Holman has maintained what he calls "a foot in both camps"—maintaining academic credibility through his chemistry professorship while engaging deeply with the practical concerns of teachers and school leaders.

## Salters Advanced Chemistry: A Context-Based Revolution

### Origins and Philosophy

Holman's founding directorship of the Salters Advanced Chemistry programme represents one of his most significant contributions to curriculum development. Initiated in the late 1980s and developed at the University of York's Science Education Group, Salters Advanced Chemistry introduced a radical context-based approach to A-level chemistry that stood in stark contrast to the traditional topic-by-topic structure of conventional courses.

The programme's guiding principle was elegantly simple: instead of teaching chemistry concepts in abstract isolation, Salters presented each chemical principle within meaningful real-world contexts. Students might learn about equilibrium through the industrial production of ammonia for fertilisers, explore organic chemistry through the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, or understand redox reactions through the chemistry of batteries and fuel cells.

### Impact and International Reach

From its initial development, Salters Advanced Chemistry has grown to become one of the most widely-used A-level chemistry programmes in the United Kingdom, currently followed by approximately 9,000 students across the country. The programme's influence extends internationally, with adapted versions being used in Russia, Spain, Slovenia, and several other countries seeking to modernise their chemistry curricula.

The Salters approach exemplifies what Holman would later term "science for citizenship"—the idea that scientific education should prepare students not merely for university study or technical careers, but for informed participation in a world increasingly shaped by scientific and technological developments. This philosophy would permeate his later work on practical science and career guidance.

### Pedagogical Legacy

The context-based approach pioneered by Salters Advanced Chemistry has influenced science curriculum development far beyond chemistry. The methodology demonstrated that rigorous academic content could be delivered through engaging, relevant contexts without sacrificing intellectual depth. This insight—that engagement and rigour are complementary rather than contradictory—would become a recurring theme in Holman's subsequent policy work.

Teachers trained in the Salters approach often report that the contextual framework helps students develop more sophisticated mental models of chemical processes, as abstract concepts become anchored to concrete, meaningful examples. The programme's emphasis on understanding the applications and implications of chemistry also supports development of the "science capital" that Holman would later argue is essential for broadening participation in STEM fields.

## The National STEM Learning Centre: Building Capacity Nationwide

### Founding Vision

In 2004, Holman was appointed founding director of the National Science Learning Centre in York, a role he held until September 2010. The Centre represented a £15 million government investment in science teacher professional development, designed to address the chronic shortage of high-quality subject-specific training available to science teachers across England.

Holman's vision for the Centre went far beyond traditional "inset day" training. He envisioned a national hub that would provide world-class professional development, conduct research into effective science pedagogy, and create a sustainable infrastructure for ongoing teacher learning. The Centre's location at the University of York deliberately bridged the gap between academic research and classroom practice.

### Expansion and Evolution

Under Holman's leadership, the Centre evolved and expanded its remit. In 2006, he was appointed as the government's first National STEM Director, overseeing coordination of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education policy across England. This role brought the National Science Learning Centre into closer alignment with broader STEM education initiatives and helped secure its position as the premier institution for science teacher professional development in the UK.

In recognition of its expanding scope, the Centre was subsequently rebranded as the National STEM Learning Centre. Holman's founding directorship established institutional structures and cultures that continue to shape science teacher professional development today. In July 2024, STEM Learning honoured Holman's contribution by naming the Centre's practical science laboratory the "Sir John Holman Practical Centre"—a fitting tribute to his lifelong advocacy for hands-on science education.

### Professional Development Model

The Centre's professional development model reflected Holman's understanding that effective teacher learning, like effective student learning, requires sustained engagement over time rather than one-off interventions. The Centre developed programmes that supported teachers through extended periods of professional growth, including subject knowledge enhancement courses, leadership development programmes, and research-informed pedagogy workshops.

Holman was particularly concerned with supporting teachers in disadvantaged areas who might otherwise have limited access to high-quality professional development. The Centre developed outreach programmes and regional partnerships designed to ensure that the benefits of its work reached schools across the entire country, not merely those with resources to send teachers to York.

## The Gatsby Career Benchmarks: Transforming Career Guidance

### Policy Context

In 2013, the Gatsby Charitable Foundation commissioned Holman to investigate international best practice in career guidance and develop a framework that could be applied in English schools. The context was concerning: despite evidence that good career guidance significantly improved student outcomes, provision in England was patchy and often ineffective. The statutory duty on schools to provide career guidance had been introduced, but without clear standards or frameworks for what good provision looked like.

Holman assembled a team that conducted extensive international research, examining career guidance systems in countries with strong records of preparing young people for the labour market, including the Netherlands, Germany, and Finland. The result was the 2014 report "Good Career Guidance," which introduced what would become known as the Gatsby Benchmarks.

### The Eight Benchmarks

The Gatsby Benchmarks established eight clear standards that define world-class career guidance:

**Benchmark 1: A Stable Careers Programme** — Every school and college should have an embedded programme of career education and guidance that is known and understood by pupils, parents, teachers, and employers.

**Benchmark 2: Learning from Career and Labour Market Information** — Every pupil and their parents should have access to good-quality information about future study options and labour market opportunities.

**Benchmark 3: Addressing the Needs of Each Pupil** — Pupils have different career guidance needs at different stages. Opportunities for advice and support should be tailored to the needs of each pupil.

**Benchmark 4: Linking Curriculum Learning to Careers** — All teachers should link curriculum learning with careers, highlighting the relevance of subjects for future career paths.

**Benchmark 5: Encounters with Employers and Employees** — Every pupil should have multiple opportunities to learn from employers about work, employment, and the skills valued in the workplace.

**Benchmark 6: Experiences of Workplaces** — Every pupil should have first-hand experiences of the workplace through work visits, job shadowing, or work experience.

**Benchmark 7: Encounters with Further and Higher Education** — All pupils should understand the full range of learning opportunities available to them, including academic and vocational routes.

**Benchmark 8: Personal Guidance** — Every pupil should have opportunities for guidance interviews with a careers adviser, trained to an appropriate level.

### Adoption and Impact

The Gatsby Benchmarks gained significant traction following their publication. The Careers and Enterprise Company, established by the government in 2015, adopted the benchmarks as the framework for its work with schools and colleges. By 2017, the government had formally endorsed the benchmarks as the standard against which school career provision should be judged.

In 2018, the government made meeting the Gatsby Benchmarks a statutory requirement for schools, cementing Holman's framework as the foundation of English career guidance policy. Schools now report annually against each benchmark, and inspection frameworks incorporate consideration of career guidance against these standards.

A 2024 report, "Good Career Guidance: The Next 10 Years," celebrated the benchmarks' impact while identifying ongoing challenges in implementation. The report noted that while most schools now had stable careers programmes (Benchmark 1), providing personal guidance to all pupils (Benchmark 8) remained challenging due to resource constraints.

### Connection to Science Education

For science teachers, the Gatsby Benchmarks have particular relevance. Benchmark 4—linking curriculum learning to careers—requires teachers to make explicit connections between science subjects and the vast range of careers that utilise scientific knowledge and skills. Holman consistently argued that this was especially important in science, where pupils often held narrow stereotypes of "science careers" limited to laboratory research or medicine.

The benchmarks also support science teachers in addressing equity issues. Research consistently shows that pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to pursue science subjects post-16, partly due to limited awareness of the opportunities that science qualifications open up. The Gatsby Benchmarks' emphasis on providing all pupils with employer encounters, workplace experiences, and high-quality labour market information helps address these inequities.

## Good Practical Science: Ten Benchmarks for Laboratory Excellence

### The Crisis in Practical Science

In 2017, the Gatsby Foundation published "Good Practical Science," a report led by Holman that addressed growing concerns about the state of practical science in English secondary schools. Despite practical work being central to science education's distinctive contribution to the curriculum, evidence suggested that its quality and frequency were declining in many schools.

Holman's investigation found multiple factors contributing to this decline: budget constraints affecting equipment procurement and maintenance; teacher confidence issues, particularly among non-specialists; assessment pressures that prioritised examination performance over investigative skills; and safety concerns that sometimes led to excessive risk aversion.

### The Ten Benchmarks for Practical Science

Drawing on international research, school visits, and extensive consultation with the science education community, Holman developed ten benchmarks that define world-class practical science provision:

**Benchmark 1: Planned Practical Science** — Every school should have a written policy that explains why teachers use practical science, the outcomes they expect from it, and how they achieve those outcomes.

**Benchmark 2: Purposeful Practical Science** — Teachers should know the purpose of any practical science activity before they carry it out, and this purpose should be evident to students.

**Benchmark 3: Expert Teachers** — Teachers should have subject-specialist training in the practical aspects of the science they teach, both initial and continuing.

**Benchmark 4: Frequent Practical Science** — Students should experience a practical activity in at least half of their science lessons.

**Benchmark 5: Laboratory Facilities** — Schools should have laboratories that are appropriate for the science they teach and are in good repair.

**Benchmark 6: Technical Support** — Schools should have technical support that enables teachers to deliver effective practical science.

**Benchmark 7: Real-World Contexts** — Practical science should be set in real-world contexts that are relevant to students' lives and experiences.

**Benchmark 8: Investigative Projects** — Students should have opportunities to carry out extended investigative projects.

**Benchmark 9: Digital Technologies** — Schools should use digital technologies to support and enhance practical science.

**Benchmark 10: Assessment** — Assessment of students' work in practical science should be fit for purpose.

### Implementation Support

Recognising that benchmarks alone would not transform practice, Holman worked with the Association for Science Education (ASE) to develop implementation support for schools. The ASE's "Good Practical Science: Making It Happen" programme provides resources, professional development, and school self-assessment tools aligned with the benchmarks.

The benchmarks have influenced Ofsted inspection practice, with inspectors now considering practical science provision when evaluating the quality of science education. They have also informed government policy, with references to practical science benchmarks appearing in statutory guidance and funding announcements.

### Pedagogical Rationale

Holman's ten benchmarks reflect a sophisticated understanding of what makes practical science educationally valuable. Benchmark 2—purposeful practical science—is particularly significant, addressing the criticism that much practical work in schools is "busy work" without clear learning objectives. By requiring teachers to be explicit about purpose, the benchmarks push schools to move beyond practical activities undertaken merely because "that's what you do in science."

Similarly, Benchmark 8—investigative projects—addresses concerns that high-stakes assessment had driven open-ended enquiry out of the curriculum. Holman argued that students need opportunities to design investigations, make decisions about methodology, and experience the uncertainty inherent in authentic scientific practice.

## STEM Teacher Workforce and Supply

### The Recruitment Challenge

Throughout his career, Holman has been acutely aware of the chronic difficulties in recruiting and retaining sufficient science teachers. As National STEM Director and subsequently as a senior adviser to the Gatsby Foundation, he consistently highlighted the mismatch between the growing demand for STEM skills in the economy and the inadequate supply of qualified science teachers in schools.

His 2023 report on science teacher recruitment and retention outlined eight cost-effective principles for addressing the crisis:

1. **Targeted recruitment incentives** — Focusing financial incentives on shortage subjects and geographic areas with the greatest need
2. **Reducing workload** — Addressing the excessive working hours that drive teachers from the profession
3. **Early career support** — Providing structured support for teachers in their first years that extends beyond the initial training year
4. **Subject-specific development** — Ensuring science teachers have access to ongoing subject knowledge enhancement
5. **Career pathways** — Creating clear progression routes that allow excellent science teachers to advance without leaving the classroom
6. **School culture** — Building school cultures that value and support science teaching
7. **Leadership development** — Preparing science department leaders to create environments where teachers want to work
8. **Flexible working** — Supporting part-time and flexible arrangements that retain experienced teachers

### Subject Specialisation

Holman has been particularly concerned about the high proportion of science lessons taught by non-specialists. Physics, chemistry, and increasingly mathematics face severe shortages, with significant numbers of lessons taught by biologists or teachers without science specialisms. This not only affects the quality of teaching but also reinforces students' perception that these subjects are difficult or inaccessible.

His work with the National STEM Learning Centre focused on providing subject knowledge enhancement for non-specialists, recognising that while these teachers could not be transformed into physicists or chemists overnight, targeted professional development could significantly improve their confidence and effectiveness.

### Long-Term Systemic Solutions

Holman has consistently argued that teacher supply problems require systemic solutions rather than short-term fixes. While bursaries and recruitment campaigns may address immediate shortages, sustainable solutions require addressing the fundamental attractiveness of science teaching as a career. This includes competitive salaries, manageable workloads, and genuine opportunities for professional growth.

His appointment as Chair of the UKRI Talent Commission in 2020 reflected recognition of his expertise in developing pathways into research careers. This work extends his focus on STEM workforce development beyond school teaching into higher education and research, recognising the continuum of STEM talent development that begins in primary classrooms and extends through to doctoral study and beyond.

## Professional Leadership and Institutional Roles

### Association for Science Education

Holman served as President of the Association for Science Education (ASE) from 2016 to 2018, the professional body representing science teachers across all phases and sectors. His presidency coincided with significant curriculum changes and the introduction of new GCSE and A-level specifications, placing him at the forefront of supporting teachers through transition.

Under his presidency, the ASE intensified its focus on research-informed practice and practical science. He used the platform to advocate for science teachers' professional status and to argue for the importance of subject-specific professional development in an era of generic teaching standards.

### Royal Society of Chemistry

As President of the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) from 2016 to 2018, Holman brought his educational perspective to the learned society representing chemistry professionals. His presidency emphasised the importance of chemistry education for producing not merely the next generation of chemists, but a scientifically literate citizenry capable of engaging with the chemical challenges of the twenty-first century.

The RSC's endorsement of the Good Practical Science benchmarks under his presidency lent significant authority to the framework. His dual role as ASE and RSC president—unusual in the history of both organisations—demonstrated the esteem in which he was held across the science education and chemistry communities.

### The Bridge Group

As Chair of the Bridge Group from 2018, Holman extended his focus on social mobility into higher education. The Bridge Group is a non-profit consultancy that works with universities and employers to improve access and progression for students from underrepresented backgrounds.

This role connected with his earlier work on career guidance, as the Bridge Group's research consistently demonstrated that students from disadvantaged backgrounds face particular barriers in navigating the transition from school to higher education and employment. His work with the group informed the "Good Career Guidance" benchmarks' emphasis on providing all students with the information and experiences necessary to make informed decisions about their futures.

### Government Advisory Roles

In 2021, Holman was appointed Independent Strategic Adviser on Careers to the Secretary of State for Education, a role that gave him direct influence over government career guidance policy. This appointment reflected the success of the Gatsby Benchmarks and the respect in which his expertise was held across the political spectrum.

His advisory work has consistently emphasised the importance of evidence-based policy and the need for long-term stability in education reform. He has cautioned against the tendency for new governments to introduce wholesale changes to structures and qualifications, arguing that this instability undermines the capacity of schools to embed and refine practice.

## Pedagogical Philosophy and Legacy

### Science for All

A consistent thread throughout Holman's work is the conviction that science education should serve all students, not merely those who will pursue scientific careers. From the context-based approach of Salters Advanced Chemistry to the career guidance benchmarks' emphasis on preparing all young people for successful transitions, Holman's vision has been consistently inclusive.

This commitment to "science for all" reflects both educational and democratic values. Educationally, Holman argues that science provides uniquely powerful ways of understanding the world that all citizens should have access to. Democratically, he recognises that in a world where scientific and technological developments shape public policy—from climate change to healthcare to artificial intelligence—a scientifically illiterate population cannot meaningfully participate in democratic deliberation.
