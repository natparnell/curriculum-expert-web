# Michael Reiss

## Biography and Academic Background

Professor Michael J. Reiss (born 1960) is a British bioethicist, educator, and science education researcher who has made substantial contributions to curriculum design, practical science pedagogy, and the integration of ethical issues within science education. He holds the position of Professor of Science Education at the UCL Institute of Education (IOE), University College London, where he also serves as Assistant Director for Research and Development.

Reiss's academic credentials reflect a diverse intellectual background: he holds an MA from the University of Cambridge, a PhD, a PGCE (Postgraduate Certificate in Education), and an MBA. This combination of scientific training, educational expertise, and management knowledge has informed his multifaceted approach to science education research and policy. Uniquely among science educators, Reiss is also an ordained priest in the Church of England, a background that has shaped his particular interest in the interface between science and religion within educational contexts.

Beyond his academic roles, Reiss has held significant positions in professional and ethical bodies. He is a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences (FAcSS), a Fellow of the Royal Society of Biology (FRSB), and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (FRSA). He serves as a member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, one of the UK's leading bodies for examining ethical questions in biology and medicine. Additionally, he holds the position of President of the International Society for Science and Religion and the International Association for Science and Religion in Schools, reflecting his commitment to fostering productive dialogue between scientific and religious worldviews in educational settings.

## The Aims-Based Curriculum

### Foundational Principles

Perhaps Reiss's most significant contribution to curriculum theory is his work on the aims-based curriculum, developed in collaboration with philosopher of education Professor John White. Their influential 2013 publication, *An Aims-Based Curriculum: The Significance of Human Flourishing for Schools* (IOE Press), presents a fundamental challenge to traditional approaches to curriculum design.

Reiss and White argue that curriculum development should begin with overarching aims for education rather than, as is typically the case, with the subjects to be taught. They contend that starting with subjects inevitably leads to a focus on content coverage and disciplinary boundaries, whereas starting with aims ensures that educational experiences are genuinely purposeful and aligned with what matters most for human development.

The central aim they propose is **human flourishing**—equipping each learner to lead a personally fulfilling life while helping others to do so too. This philosophical foundation draws on Aristotelian concepts of eudaimonia (well-being or flourishing) but translates them into practical implications for curriculum design. Reiss and White argue that if education is genuinely to promote human flourishing, then curriculum decisions at every level—from national policy to individual lesson planning—should be evaluated against this criterion.

### Implications for Science Education

Reiss has been particularly concerned with illustrating what an aims-based approach means for science education specifically. In his 2014 article "An aims-based curriculum illustrated by the teaching of science in schools" (published in *The Curriculum Journal*), he demonstrates how starting with aims transforms decisions about what science to teach and how to teach it.

Rather than asking "What science content should students cover?" an aims-based approach asks: "What contributions can science education make to students' flourishing?" This reframing has several important consequences:

**Relevance and motivation**: Science education should address questions and issues that genuinely matter to students' lives and futures, not just prepare them for further scientific study.

**Interdisciplinary connections**: When the goal is flourishing rather than disciplinary coverage, the artificial boundaries between science and other subjects become less significant. Reiss advocates for curriculum designs that connect science meaningfully with ethics, the arts, and civic education.

**Assessment reform**: An aims-based curriculum requires assessment approaches that can evaluate progress towards human flourishing, not just factual recall or technical skills. Reiss has critiqued high-stakes examination systems that distort teaching away from deeper educational purposes.

**Student agency**: The approach emphasises student choice and autonomy, recognising that flourishing involves pursuing one's own developing interests and commitments rather than following a predetermined path.

Reiss and White's work has influenced curriculum thinking internationally, with their book being translated into multiple languages including Korean. The approach has been particularly influential among educators questioning the subject-centred assumptions of traditional National Curriculum designs.

## Ethics in Science Education

### The Case for Ethical Engagement

A second major strand of Reiss's work concerns the place of ethics within science education. Together with Dr Amanda McCrory, Reiss has argued compellingly that science lessons should include discussion of ethical issues—not as an optional add-on, but as an integral component of authentic science education.

Their 2023 IOE Blog post "Lots of children find school science lessons boring. Should science teachers include discussion of ethical issues?" makes the case forcefully. They note that many students experience school science as disconnected from their interests and concerns, contributing to declining participation in post-compulsory science education. Reiss and McCrory argue that engaging with ethical dimensions can address this motivation problem while also providing a more authentic representation of how science actually functions in society.

The example they use is telling: when the UK government authorised the emergency use of thiamethoxam (a neonicotinoid pesticide) on sugar beet in 2023, overriding the usual ban because of its toxicity to bees, this raised profound ethical questions. A single teaspoon of thiamethoxam can kill over a billion bees. Should such pesticides be used? Who decides? What values are in tension? Reiss argues that scientific literacy in the 21st century must include the capacity to engage with such questions—not to replace scientific knowledge with opinion, but to understand how scientific evidence interacts with ethical reasoning in real-world decision-making.

### Pedagogical Approaches to Ethics

Reiss has not merely advocated for the inclusion of ethics in science education but has also developed practical approaches for doing so effectively. The 2010 edited volume *Ethics in the Science and Technology Classroom: A New Approach to Teaching and Learning* (Sense Publishers), co-edited with Allyson Jones and Ann McKim, presents frameworks and strategies for ethical engagement across science and technology education.

Key pedagogical principles that emerge from Reiss's work include:

**Using authentic case studies**: Ethical discussion is most productive when anchored in real contemporary issues—genetic engineering, climate change, vaccination policy, artificial intelligence—rather than abstract hypotheticals.

**Distinguishing ethical from empirical questions**: Students need support to recognise when a dispute is fundamentally about values rather than facts, and vice versa. Reiss emphasises that scientific evidence can inform ethical decisions but cannot determine them.

**Encouraging diverse perspectives**: Ethical reasoning in pluralistic societies involves engaging with views different from one's own. Reiss's work on science and religion has informed his approach to classroom dialogue across difference.

**Connecting to agency**: Students should not merely discuss ethical issues abstractly but consider what actions they might take and what responsibilities they have as citizens in a scientifically advanced democracy.

The 2024 book *The Place of Ethics in Science Education: Implications for Practice*, co-authored with Amanda McCrory, brings together this work with practical guidance for teachers seeking to integrate ethical dimensions into their science teaching.

## Practical Science and the Effectiveness Matrix

### The Problem with Practical Work

Reiss's collaboration with Dr Ian Abrahams on practical science education has yielded one of the most influential recent contributions to this area. Their 2017 book *Enhancing Learning with Effective Practical Science 11-16* (Bloomsbury) addresses a persistent problem: despite substantial investment in practical science facilities and widespread agreement about its importance, much practical work in schools is pedagogically ineffective.

Abrahams and Reiss identify a fundamental mismatch between the intended purposes of practical work and its actual outcomes. Teachers often design practical activities with the aim of helping students understand scientific concepts—the "illustrative" or "discovery" model. However, research consistently shows that students frequently fail to make the conceptual connections teachers intend, instead focusing on the procedural demands of carrying out the experiment.

This gap between intention and outcome has been documented in numerous studies. Students may successfully complete a practical task—measuring, recording, calculating—without developing the conceptual understanding the activity was designed to support. The "hands-on" experience does not reliably translate into "minds-on" learning.

### The 2×2 Effectiveness Matrix

To address this problem, Abrahams and Reiss developed a **2×2 effectiveness matrix** that has become widely used in science teacher education and professional development. The matrix categorises practical activities according to two dimensions:

**Cognitive demand** (low to high): How much intellectual work does the activity require? Low-demand activities involve following instructions with minimal decision-making; high-demand activities require students to design investigations, make predictions, analyse unexpected results, or evaluate alternative explanations.

**Learning effectiveness** (low to high): To what extent does the activity actually achieve its intended learning outcomes? This is empirically determined through assessment of student understanding.

The four quadrants of the matrix provide a diagnostic tool for evaluating practical activities:

- **High demand, high effectiveness**: The ideal—intellectually challenging activities that achieve their learning goals
- **High demand, low effectiveness**: Activities that are cognitively challenging but fail to produce learning (often due to insufficient scaffolding or unclear purpose)
- **Low demand, high effectiveness**: Effective activities that consolidate understanding without requiring complex intellectual work
- **Low demand, low effectiveness**: Activities that are neither challenging nor effective—the most problematic quadrant

Abrahams and Reiss argue that many commonly used practical activities fall into the low-demand, low-effectiveness category—what they term "busy work." Students are occupied but not genuinely learning. The matrix provides a framework for identifying such activities and redesigning them to increase either cognitive demand, effectiveness, or both.

### Five Generic Aims for Practical Work

Beyond the matrix, Abrahams and Reiss identify five legitimate aims that practical work can serve in science education:

**1. Enhancing learning of scientific knowledge**: Practical activities can help students understand scientific concepts, but this requires careful design to ensure conceptual engagement rather than mere procedural completion.

**2. Developing understanding of scientific inquiry**: Practical work can provide experience of how scientific knowledge is generated, including the role of evidence, the nature of scientific explanation, and the provisional nature of scientific claims.

**3. Developing practical skills and expertise**: Some practical activities legitimately aim to develop specific laboratory techniques and manipulative skills that have value in themselves.

**4. Developing understanding of the nature of scientific knowledge**: Practical work can illuminate the characteristics of scientific knowledge—its empirical basis, its theoretical ladenness, its social dimensions.

**5. Motivating students and developing interest in science**: Well-designed practical work can engage students' curiosity and foster positive attitudes towards science.

Abrahams and Reiss emphasise that any given practical activity should have a clear primary aim, and its effectiveness should be evaluated against that aim. Activities that fail to achieve any of these aims effectively should be reconsidered. Their book provides a substantial collection of practical activities, each analysed using the effectiveness matrix and linked to explicit aims.

## Science and Religion: The Creationism Controversy

### The 2008 Incident

Reiss's work on the interface between science and religion gained significant public attention in 2008 when, as Director of Education at the Royal Society, he made comments about the teaching of creationism in science classrooms that were widely misreported and led to his resignation from that position.

Speaking at the British Science Festival, Reiss argued that it was more educationally effective to engage with students' creationist views rather than simply dismissing them. He noted that some students come from backgrounds where creationism is taught as fact, and that these students often find science lessons that present evolution as established truth to be alienating and confusing. Reiss suggested that teachers should be equipped to engage with students' questions and concerns about creationism, explaining why scientists accept evolutionary theory while respecting the student's right to hold different views.

This position was misreported in the media as suggesting that creationism should be taught as a valid scientific alternative to evolution. Despite clarifications from Reiss and supportive statements from prominent scientists including Sir David Attenborough, the Royal Society announced Reiss's resignation, stating that his comments had led to a misapprehension about his views.

### Educational Philosophy

The 2008 controversy, though personally difficult for Reiss, exemplifies his consistent educational philosophy. His position was not that creationism is scientifically valid—he has consistently affirmed the scientific consensus on evolution—but that effective science education requires engaging with students' existing beliefs and questions, even when those questions challenge scientific orthodoxy.

Reiss's approach can be understood through several key principles:

**Cognitive conflict and learning**: Students cannot simply be told to abandon beliefs held deeply and supported by their families and communities. Meaningful learning requires working through cognitive conflict, not suppressing it.

**Respectful dialogue**: Science classrooms should be places where students feel safe to express doubts and ask questions. Shutting down discussion of creationism may silence students and prevent genuine engagement with evolutionary thinking.

**Distinguishing science from non-science**: Reiss argues that addressing creationism in science lessons provides an opportunity to teach about the nature of science—how scientific theories are developed, tested, and validated, and why creationism does not meet scientific criteria.

**The teacher's role**: Teachers need preparation for handling these discussions sensitively and effectively. Reiss has advocated for explicit training in Initial Teacher Education (ITE) and continuing professional development (CPD) on science and religion issues.

Reiss continued to develop these ideas in subsequent publications, including a 2011 article in the *Journal of Philosophy of Education* titled "How Should Creationism and Intelligent Design be Dealt with in the Classroom?" Here he clarified his position, arguing that while creationism and intelligent design should not be taught as scientific alternatives to evolution, science teachers should be prepared to engage with students who hold such views, using the encounter as an opportunity to explore the nature of scientific knowledge.

## Contributions to Professional Organisations

### The Royal Society

Reiss's tenure as Director of Education at the Royal Society (2006-2008) represented a significant contribution to science education policy at the national level. During this period, he oversaw the Royal Society's educational programmes and contributed to policy documents on science education. Though his tenure ended prematurely due to the creationism controversy, his influence on the Royal Society's educational thinking was substantial.

In 2009, Reiss joined many of the UK's most senior scientists in writing to the Schools Secretary about the importance of science education, demonstrating his continued engagement with policy advocacy.

### The Association for Science Education (ASE)

Reiss has maintained a long-standing relationship with the ASE, the UK's professional body for science educators. He has served as a frequent contributor to ASE conferences, journal articles, and publications. His editorship of the ASE's *Teaching Secondary Biology* (third edition, 2014) provided a comprehensive resource for biology teachers, structured around effective pedagogical approaches and informed by research evidence.

The book exemplifies Reiss's commitment to research-informed practice, with each chapter addressing common student misconceptions, suggested teaching sequences, safety considerations, enhancement ideas for relating science to everyday contexts, and suggestions for using ICT effectively.

### The Faraday Institute

As a member of the Faraday Institute for Science and Religion at the University of Cambridge, Reiss contributes to research and public engagement on the relationship between scientific and religious worldviews. The Faraday Institute's mission aligns with Reiss's commitment to constructive dialogue between these domains, recognising that for many students and teachers, questions about science and religion are genuinely significant.

Reiss's work with the Faraday Institute has included developing resources for teachers on handling science and religion questions in the classroom, contributing to the institute's broader mission of promoting informed discussion of these issues.

## Research on Science Education Beyond the Classroom

### The Primacy of Out-of-School Learning

A distinctive theme in Reiss's recent work is the recognition that most science learning occurs outside formal schooling. In interviews and publications, he has emphasised that from early childhood through adulthood, the majority of what people learn about science comes from informal sources—family conversations, media, museums, hobbies, and everyday experience.

This observation has significant implications for school science. Rather than seeing themselves as the primary providers of scientific knowledge, schools should recognise their role as one component of a broader ecosystem of science learning. Reiss argues that school science should:

**Connect with out-of-school experience**: Build on and relate to the science learning that occurs in students' everyday lives, rather than presenting science as entirely separate from it.

**Develop critical engagement skills**: Given that much science information comes from media sources of varying quality, school science should prioritise developing students' capacity to evaluate scientific claims critically.

**Foster lifelong science interest**: School science should aim to sustain and develop students' interest in science beyond their formal education, recognising that scientific literacy is a lifelong developmental process.

Reiss's developing book project on this theme—though long-delayed, as he acknowledges with characteristic self-awareness—promises to provide a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding science education in its broader social context.

### Sex Education and Science

Reiss's research interests extend beyond conventional science education to include sex education, reflecting his bioethical expertise. He has written extensively on the educational dimensions of sex and relationships education, including the role of values, the appropriate balance between biological and social dimensions, and the challenges of teaching these topics in culturally diverse contexts.

This work demonstrates Reiss's commitment to education that addresses the whole person—not just intellectual development but also the formation of values, relationships, and personal identity. His bioethical framework informs his approach, emphasising respect for persons, informed consent, and attention to the social contexts within which educational decisions are made.

## Pedagogical Philosophy and Classroom Implications

### Beyond Transmission

Reiss's work consistently challenges transmission models of science education. Whether writing about practical work, ethical issues, or curriculum aims, he emphasises that effective science education requires active intellectual engagement from students. Information delivery—whether through lectures, textbooks, or practical demonstrations—cannot on its own produce deep understanding or lasting learning. Reiss argues that students must be given opportunities to grapple with ideas, formulate their own questions, test their predictions, and construct meaning through active intellectual labour.

This constructivist orientation aligns with his broader philosophical commitments. Education, for Reiss, is not about filling empty vessels with knowledge but about supporting the development of capable, thoughtful persons who can navigate a complex world. This has implications for classroom practice:

**Questioning and dialogue**: Classrooms should be dialogic spaces where students' questions are taken seriously and used to drive learning forward. Reiss's work on creationism and ethics demonstrates his commitment to engaging with students' authentic concerns rather than deflecting them.

**Making thinking visible**: Teachers should employ strategies that make students' thinking processes visible—both to the teacher for diagnostic purposes and to students themselves for metacognitive development. This might include prediction exercises, concept mapping, or structured reflection on practical work.

**Connecting to lived experience**: Effective science teaching, in Reiss's view, bridges the gap between abstract scientific concepts and students' lived experience. This requires teachers to know their students well and to design learning experiences that connect with their interests, concerns, and prior understandings.

### The Role of the Teacher

Reiss's philosophy assigns teachers a complex and demanding role. They are not mere deliverers of curriculum content but facilitators of learning, diagnosticians of student thinking, designers of learning experiences, and ethical guides. This conception of teaching requires substantial professional knowledge—knowledge of subject matter, of how students learn that subject matter, of pedagogical strategies, and of the social and ethical dimensions of science education.

Reiss has been a consistent advocate for high-quality Initial Teacher Education (ITE) and continuing professional development (CPD). He recognises that the ambitious vision of science education he proposes cannot be realised without well-prepared, continuously developing teachers who have the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to support deep learning.

### Assessment and Accountability

Reiss has critiqued prevailing assessment regimes for distorting science education away from its most valuable purposes. When high-stakes examinations emphasise recall of factual information and execution of standard procedures, they incentivise teaching approaches that neglect deeper understanding, ethical engagement, and the development of scientific habits of mind.

An aims-based approach to curriculum, Reiss argues, requires corresponding reforms to assessment. This does not mean abandoning rigorous evaluation of student learning, but rather developing assessment approaches that can capture progress towards the full range of educational aims—including understanding, critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and scientific inquiry capabilities. Reiss has supported the development of innovative assessment approaches, including coursework, portfolios, and practical examinations that evaluate process skills as well as products.

## Legacy and Influence

Michael Reiss's influence on science education extends across multiple domains: curriculum theory, practical pedagogy, ethics education, and the science-religion interface. His work has shaped the thinking of science educators internationally, and his publications are widely used in teacher education programmes.

Several distinctive features characterise his contribution:

**Integration of theory and practice**: Reiss consistently connects philosophical and theoretical arguments to practical classroom implications. His work is theoretically sophisticated but never loses sight of what matters for teachers and learners.

**Interdisciplinary reach**: Drawing on philosophy, bioethics, theology, and educational research, Reiss demonstrates the value of bringing multiple disciplinary perspectives to bear on science education questions.

**Commitment to dialogue**: Whether addressing the science-religion interface or ethical disagreements in the classroom, Reiss models an approach based on respectful engagement across difference rather than polemical confrontation.

**Attention to the whole person**: Reiss's work consistently emphasises that science education serves human flourishing—not merely the production of future scientists or the transmission of cultural knowledge, but the development of capable, thoughtful persons.

For teachers seeking to develop their practice, Reiss's work offers resources for: designing more effective practical work; integrating ethical dimensions into science teaching; engaging constructively with students' questions and concerns; and connecting science education to broader educational purposes. His influence is likely to continue shaping science education research and practice for years to come.
