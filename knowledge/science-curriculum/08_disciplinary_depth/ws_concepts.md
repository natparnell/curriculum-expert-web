# Concepts in Working Scientifically

## Introduction: Working Scientifically as Disciplinary Knowledge

Working scientifically represents the disciplinary dimension of science education—the methods, processes, and concepts through which scientific knowledge is constructed, evaluated, and refined. Introduced in the 2014 National Curriculum for England, working scientifically sits alongside substantive knowledge (biology, chemistry, physics content) as a core component of science education from the Early Years Foundation Stage through to Key Stage 4 and beyond.

Unlike the content-focused programmes of study that specify what pupils should know about the natural world, working scientifically addresses how scientists work and, crucially, how pupils can learn to think and work as scientists themselves. This encompasses both procedural skills (planning investigations, making measurements, recording data) and conceptual understanding (the ideas that underpin why scientists work in particular ways). The National Curriculum specifies that working scientifically "must always be taught through and clearly related to substantive science content in the programme of study"—emphasising that these disciplinary concepts gain meaning through application to real scientific questions.

The Ofsted science subject report, *Finding the Optimum* (2023), emphasised the importance of pupils developing their knowledge of all areas of working scientifically, including different types of scientific enquiry and concepts such as evidence and accuracy. The report noted that high-quality science education ensures pupils have enough opportunities to take part in practical work that has a clear purpose in relation to the curriculum. This guidance underscores that working scientifically is not merely a set of practical activities to be completed, but a body of disciplinary knowledge requiring explicit teaching and deliberate practice.

## The Five Types of Scientific Enquiry

The National Curriculum identifies five distinct types of scientific enquiry that pupils should encounter across primary and secondary education. These represent different approaches to answering scientific questions, each with its own purposes, methods, and underlying concepts.

### Observing Over Time

Observing over time involves monitoring how things change and identifying patterns in those changes. This type of enquiry develops pupils' ability to notice gradual changes that might not be immediately apparent and to understand that scientific phenomena often unfold across extended periods. In the early years and Key Stage 1, this might involve observing the growth of plants, the melting of ice, or changes in weather patterns. By Key Stage 2, pupils develop more systematic approaches, making regular measurements and recording data over days or weeks.

The Ogden Trust's guidance on observing over time enquiries distinguishes between qualitative observations (noticing changes in appearance, behaviour, or state) and quantitative measurements (recording numerical data at regular intervals). As pupils progress, they move from simple noticing to more structured data collection, eventually using their observations to identify patterns and draw conclusions about cause-and-effect relationships. The Point-Evidence-Explanation (PEE) framework provides a useful structure for supporting pupils to articulate their conclusions based on observational data.

### Pattern Seeking

Pattern seeking involves observing, measuring, and recording naturally occurring events or phenomena to identify relationships between variables that cannot be easily controlled. Unlike fair testing, where the investigator deliberately manipulates one variable, pattern seeking involves looking for correlations in data that already exists in the world. Pupils might investigate whether there is a relationship between the size of a bird's beak and the type of food it eats, or whether the number of hours of daylight correlates with temperature.

The Ogden Trust guidance notes that pattern-seeking enquiries require children to make measurements or observations, find ways to record and analyse their data, and develop the conceptual understanding that correlation does not necessarily imply causation. In Key Stage 1, this involves making and recording simple data values, while in Key Stage 2, pupils develop more systematic and accurate measuring techniques that can then be analysed to identify patterns and relationships.

### Identifying, Classifying and Grouping

This type of enquiry involves sorting objects, living things, or events into groups based on their characteristics and understanding the criteria used for classification. It develops pupils' ability to observe closely, identify similarities and differences, and recognise that scientific classification systems are based on particular characteristics. In biology, this might involve classifying organisms using keys; in materials science, grouping substances by their properties; in physics, categorising types of forces or energy.

Classification activities help pupils understand that scientists organise knowledge in systematic ways to make it more manageable and to reveal relationships between different phenomena. The National Curriculum emphasises that pupils should understand how classification keys work and be able to construct simple keys of their own by upper Key Stage 2.

### Comparative and Fair Testing (Controlled Investigations)

Comparative and fair testing represents the most structured type of scientific enquiry, where variables are deliberately controlled to investigate relationships between cause and effect. The National Curriculum specifies that pupils should engage in "comparative and fair testing (controlled investigations)" as one of the five types of enquiry. This approach involves changing one variable (the independent variable) while keeping all other relevant variables constant (control variables), then measuring the effect on another variable (the dependent variable).

The concept of a "fair test" is introduced in primary science as a foundation for understanding controlled experimentation. Pupils learn that to find out whether one factor affects another, they must change only that factor and keep everything else the same. For example, when investigating which material makes the best parachute, pupils must keep the size and shape of the parachute constant while varying only the material. This intuitive understanding of fairness develops into the more formal understanding of variables and experimental design in secondary science.

### Researching Using Secondary Sources

Research using secondary sources involves using existing data, information, and evidence gathered by others to answer scientific questions. This type of enquiry is essential because many scientific questions cannot be answered through classroom practical work—either because the phenomena are too large (climate patterns, tectonic movements), too small (subatomic particles), too dangerous, or require equipment and time beyond school resources. The National Curriculum specifies that pupils should recognise when and how secondary sources might help them answer questions that cannot be answered through practical investigations.

Developing pupils' ability to evaluate and use secondary sources critically is increasingly important in an age of information abundance. Pupils must learn to assess the reliability of sources, understand how scientific consensus develops through the scrutiny of evidence, and recognise that scientific knowledge evolves as new evidence emerges. This connects directly to broader goals of scientific literacy and preparing pupils to engage with socio-scientific issues throughout their lives.

## Variables in Scientific Investigation

Understanding variables is fundamental to working scientifically. Variables are factors, characteristics, or quantities that can change or be changed in an investigation. The National Curriculum and examination specifications identify three main types of variables that pupils must learn to distinguish and manipulate.

### Independent Variables

The independent variable is the factor that the investigator deliberately changes or selects to test its effect. It is the "input" or cause that the scientist suspects might influence the outcome. For example, in an investigation into how the height from which a ball is dropped affects how high it bounces, the drop height is the independent variable. The investigator deliberately varies this factor to observe what happens.

Teaching pupils to identify the independent variable requires them to understand the structure of a scientific question. Questions framed as "How does X affect Y?" or "What is the effect of X on Y?" indicate that X is the independent variable. This conceptual understanding develops from early years, where pupils might explore "what happens if..." questions, through to GCSE, where pupils must design investigations with clearly identified independent variables.

### Dependent Variables

The dependent variable is what is measured or observed during an investigation. It is the "output" or effect that changes in response to variations in the independent variable. In the ball-bouncing example, the dependent variable is the height the ball bounces—this is what the investigator measures to see if it is affected by the drop height.

Pupils often struggle to distinguish dependent from independent variables, particularly when both factors could potentially be measured. Teaching strategies that emphasise the cause-and-effect relationship—"what you change" versus "what you measure"—help develop this understanding. Practical activities where pupils physically label or identify these variables in different contexts reinforce the distinction.

### Control Variables

Control variables are factors that must be kept constant to ensure a fair test. If control variables are not kept constant, any observed changes in the dependent variable might be caused by changes in these other factors rather than the independent variable being tested. In the ball-bouncing investigation, control variables include the type of ball, the surface it bounces on, and the method of measurement.

Understanding control variables requires pupils to think systematically about what factors might influence the outcome of an investigation. This involves considering all the variables that could potentially affect the dependent variable and identifying which ones must be controlled. Teaching approaches that use "variable hunts"—where pupils brainstorm all the factors that might affect a particular outcome—develop this systematic thinking.

The concept of validity is closely linked to control variables. A valid investigation is one that actually tests what it claims to test, and controlling variables appropriately is essential for validity. The Science Teacher website notes that "validity—the suitability of the investigative procedure to answer the question being asked—is all about controlling variables."

## Fair Testing and Controlled Investigations

Fair testing is the foundational concept underlying controlled scientific investigation. It embodies the principle that to determine whether one factor causes an effect, all other potentially influential factors must be kept constant. This concept is introduced intuitively in primary science and developed into a more formal understanding of experimental design at secondary level.

### The Logic of Fair Testing

The logic of fair testing can be understood through analogy to competitive situations. Just as a race is only fair if all competitors start from the same position and face the same conditions, a scientific investigation is only fair if the factor being tested is the only thing that differs between conditions. This intuitive appeal to fairness provides an accessible entry point for young pupils, which can then be developed into more sophisticated understanding.

By Key Stage 2, pupils should understand that fair testing involves:
- Changing only one factor (the independent variable)
- Keeping all other relevant factors the same (control variables)
- Measuring the outcome (dependent variable) in the same way each time
- Repeating measurements to check reliability

### Developing Understanding Across Key Stages

In the Early Years Foundation Stage and Key Stage 1, pupils engage in simple comparative tests, exploring questions like "which paper makes the best parachute?" or "which material is the most waterproof?" These activities introduce the concept of changing one thing while keeping others the same, though the formal vocabulary of variables is not yet required.

By lower Key Stage 2, pupils begin to use the language of fair testing more explicitly. The National Curriculum specifies that pupils should "set up simple practical enquiries, comparative and fair tests." At this stage, pupils learn to identify when a test is fair and suggest ways to make unfair tests fairer.

Upper Key Stage 2 develops more systematic understanding. Pupils plan investigations with explicit consideration of variables, recognise the need for repeated measurements to improve reliability, and begin to understand that sample size affects the confidence with which conclusions can be drawn.

At Key Stage 3 and GCSE, the concept of fair testing develops into a more sophisticated understanding of experimental design. Pupils learn about:
- Systematic and random errors
- The relationship between reliability and repeatability
- The concept of accuracy and how it differs from precision
- Methods for minimising uncertainty in measurements
- The importance of control groups in biological investigations

## Correlation, Causation and Evidence

A critical disciplinary concept in working scientifically is understanding the relationship between correlation and causation. This distinction is fundamental to scientific reasoning and is increasingly important in an age where data is abundant but interpretation requires critical thinking.

### Understanding Correlation

Correlation describes a statistical relationship between two variables—when changes in one variable are associated with changes in another. For example, there might be a correlation between ice cream sales and drowning incidents (both increase in summer months), or between children's shoe size and their reading ability (both increase with age). The InnerDrive teaching guide defines correlation as "a statistical measure that describes an association between an action (A) and another action (B)."

In pattern-seeking enquiries, pupils look for correlations in naturally occurring data. They might investigate whether there is a relationship between the length of a pendulum and its swing time, or between the amount of fertiliser and plant growth. Finding a correlation provides a basis for forming hypotheses about possible causal relationships, but correlation alone cannot establish causation.

### The Causation Distinction

Causation implies that changes in one variable directly produce changes in another. Establishing causation requires more than observing correlation—it requires understanding the mechanism by which one factor influences another and, ideally, experimental evidence from controlled investigations where the suspected cause is deliberately manipulated.

The confusion between correlation and causation is common both in scientific reasoning and in public discourse. Teach Like a Champion (2017) notes how research reporting that "curiosity is one of the strongest markers of academic success" can be misinterpreted as showing that curiosity causes success, when the research actually shows only correlation. This distinction matters enormously for educational decision-making—if curiosity is merely correlated with success (perhaps because both are caused by a third factor like socioeconomic status), then programmes aimed at increasing curiosity might not improve outcomes.

Teaching the correlation-causation distinction involves:
- Providing examples where correlation exists without causation (ice cream and drowning)
- Discussing potential confounding variables that might explain observed correlations
- Emphasising that controlled experiments are needed to establish causation
- Exploring the concept of mechanisms—how would A cause B?
- Using real-world examples from health, social science, and media reporting

### Evidence and Theory in Science

The relationship between evidence and theory is central to understanding how scientific knowledge develops. Science education involves helping pupils understand that scientific theories are not mere guesses but well-substantiated explanations supported by extensive evidence, and that scientific knowledge evolves as new evidence emerges.

Wynne Harlen's *Working with Big Ideas of Science Education* (Association for Science Education) explains that "science is a search to explain and understand phenomena in the natural world" and that explanations are often "in terms of the factors that have to be present for an event to take place as shown by evidence from observations and experiments." This perspective emphasises that scientific explanations are evidence-based and subject to testing.

Pupils should understand that:
- Scientific theories explain broad patterns of evidence
- New evidence can lead to refinement or replacement of theories
- Scientific consensus emerges through the scrutiny of evidence by the scientific community
- Scientific knowledge is durable but not absolute—it is the best current explanation given available evidence

## Accuracy, Precision and Measurement

Measurement is fundamental to scientific practice, and understanding the concepts of accuracy, precision, and uncertainty is essential for working scientifically across all key stages.

### Accuracy and Precision

Accuracy and precision are distinct concepts that are often confused. Accuracy refers to how close a measurement is to the true value—the degree to which a measurement reflects the actual quantity being measured. Precision refers to how close repeated measurements are to each other—the reproducibility or consistency of measurements.

A measurement can be precise without being accurate (systematic error) and accurate without being precise (random error). For example, a poorly calibrated balance might give readings that are consistently 2 grams too high—precise (consistent) but not accurate. Conversely, measurements that vary widely around the true value might average to be accurate but lack precision.

The Royal Society of Chemistry education resources emphasise that pupils should develop skills in "evaluating data in terms of accuracy, precision, repeatability and reproducibility and identifying potential sources of random and systematic error." This involves understanding that:
- Systematic errors affect accuracy (consistently too high or too low)
- Random errors affect precision (unpredictable variation)
- Both types of error can be minimised through careful technique and appropriate equipment

### Uncertainty and Significant Figures

All measurements have some degree of uncertainty. This uncertainty is represented by the number of significant figures in the measurement. For example, a balance reading of 0.0345 g with an uncertainty of ±0.0001 g indicates that the true value lies between 0.0344 g and 0.0346 g.

Teaching pupils about measurement uncertainty helps them understand why repeated measurements are valuable, why scientists use specific equipment for specific purposes, and how to report results appropriately. It also connects to broader understanding about the provisional nature of scientific knowledge—all measurements are approximations with associated uncertainty.

### Developing Measurement Skills Across Key Stages

In the Early Years Foundation Stage, measurement begins with direct comparison and non-standard units. Children compare lengths, masses, and capacities using informal measures and descriptive language.

Key Stage 1 introduces standard units and simple measuring equipment. Pupils learn to use rulers, weighing scales, and measuring containers, recognising that standard units allow consistent communication of measurements.

Lower Key Stage 2 develops more precise measurement skills. Pupils use a wider range of equipment, read scales with increasing precision, and begin to understand that measurements should be repeated to check reliability.

Upper Key Stage 2 introduces more sophisticated concepts including the selection of appropriate equipment for particular measurements, understanding that all measurements involve some uncertainty, and using averages to improve reliability.

At Key Stage 3 and GCSE, pupils engage with formal concepts of accuracy, precision, uncertainty, and error. They learn to calculate percentage error, understand the distinction between random and systematic errors, and select and justify appropriate measuring equipment for particular investigations.

## Progression in Working Scientifically Concepts

Progression in working scientifically involves both increasing sophistication of conceptual understanding and development of practical skills. The National Curriculum and examination specifications provide a framework for this progression.

### Early Years Foundation Stage

In the EYFS, working scientifically concepts emerge through exploration and play. Children develop foundational concepts including:
- That objects and materials have observable properties
- That things change over time
- That careful observation reveals information about the world
- That they can ask questions and find answers through exploration

These early experiences provide the foundation for more formal scientific enquiry in Key Stage 1.

### Key Stage 1 (Years 1-2)

By the end of Key Stage 1, pupils should:
- Ask simple questions and recognise that they can be answered in different ways
- Observe closely, using simple equipment
- Perform simple tests
- Identify and classify things
- Use their observations and ideas to suggest answers to questions
- Gather and record data to help in answering questions

At this stage, concepts are introduced informally. Pupils engage in all five types of enquiry but without formal vocabulary about variables. The emphasis is on developing curiosity, observation skills, and the understanding that there are systematic ways to find answers.

### Lower Key Stage 2 (Years 3-4)

By the end of lower Key Stage 2, pupils should:
- Ask relevant questions and use different types of scientific enquiries to answer them
- Set up simple practical enquiries, comparative and fair tests
- Make systematic and careful observations
- Take accurate measurements using standard units
- Gather, record, classify and present data
- Report on findings from enquiries
- Use straightforward scientific evidence to answer questions

This stage introduces the language of fair testing and begins to develop systematic approaches to investigation. Pupils learn to identify variables informally and understand why keeping things constant matters.

### Upper Key Stage 2 (Years 5-6)

By the end of upper Key Stage 2, pupils should:
- Plan different types of scientific enquiries to answer questions
- Recognise and control variables where necessary
- Take measurements with increasing accuracy and precision
- Record data and results using scientific diagrams, labels, classification keys, tables, and graphs
- Use test results to make predictions and set up further comparative and fair tests
- Report and present findings from enquiries
- Identify scientific evidence that supports or refutes ideas or arguments

At this stage, pupils develop more formal understanding of concepts including variables, reliability through repeated measurements, and the relationship between evidence and conclusions.

### Key Stage 3 (Years 7-9)

By the end of Key Stage 3, pupils should:
- Understand the relationships between scientific ideas and their power to explain
- Develop understanding of the nature, processes, and methods of science
- Use scientific theories, models, and explanations to develop and test arguments
- Evaluate scientific evidence and data, and understand the strengths and limitations of different types

Key Stage 3 develops more sophisticated conceptual understanding including the distinction between correlation and causation, the relationship between theory and evidence, and the nature of scientific uncertainty.

### Key Stage 4/GCSE (Years 10-11)

At GCSE, working scientifically concepts are developed to a level where pupils can:
- Develop hypotheses and plan experiments to test them
- Make predictions based on scientific knowledge and understanding
- Select appropriate techniques, apparatus, and materials
- Recognise sources of uncertainty and evaluate their impact
- Identify and explain anomalies in data
- Evaluate the reliability and validity of methods and data
- Make evidence-based decisions and communicate conclusions appropriately

GCSE science specifications from all awarding bodies include assessment of working scientifically through written examinations and required practical activities.

## Common Misconceptions in Working Scientifically

Understanding common misconceptions helps teachers anticipate and address difficulties pupils may encounter when learning working scientifically concepts.

### Variables and Fair Testing

Common misconceptions about variables include:
- Confusing independent and dependent variables (thinking that whichever is mentioned first in a question is the independent variable)
- Believing that changing the dependent variable causes changes in the independent variable (reversing the causal relationship)
- Thinking that control variables do not matter as long as you change the independent variable
- Believing that fair testing only involves changing one thing, without understanding that other factors must be kept constant

Addressing these misconceptions requires explicit teaching, multiple examples, and opportunities for pupils to identify and justify variables in different contexts.

### Correlation and Causation

Pupils often struggle with the correlation-causation distinction, believing that:
- If two things are related, one must cause the other
- Scientific investigations always aim to prove causation
- Patterns in data automatically imply cause-and-effect relationships

Teaching should explicitly contrast examples of correlation with and without causation, helping pupils recognise that additional evidence (controlled experiments, understood mechanisms) is needed to establish causation.

### Evidence and Certainty

Misconceptions about evidence include:
- Believing that scientific knowledge is absolute and unchanging
- Thinking that a single experiment can prove or disprove a theory
- Confusing scientific theories with everyday guesses or hypotheses
- Believing that scientists work entirely objectively without prior assumptions

Addressing these requires teaching the nature of science explicitly—the tentative but durable nature of scientific knowledge, the role of evidence in building and revising theories, and the human dimensions of scientific practice.

## Pedagogical Approaches

Effective teaching of working scientifically concepts requires approaches that go beyond simply providing practical experiences to explicitly developing conceptual understanding.

### Explicit Teaching of Concepts

While practical work is essential, working scientifically concepts require explicit teaching. This includes:
- Introducing and defining key vocabulary (variables, fair test, correlation, etc.)
- Providing clear explanations of why scientists work in particular ways
- Using worked examples to demonstrate concepts in context
- Creating opportunities for pupils to articulate their understanding

The Ofsted science report emphasised that practical work should have a clear purpose and that pupils should understand what they are doing and why. Explicit teaching ensures that pupils develop conceptual understanding alongside procedural skills.

### Using Models and Analogies

Models and analogies help make abstract concepts concrete:
- Fair testing can be understood through sporting analogies (fair races, equal starting points)
- Variables can be modelled using cause-and-effect chains
- Correlation without causation can be illustrated through memorable examples (pirate numbers and global warming)

Effective use of models requires checking that pupils understand the limits of the analogy as well as its explanatory power.

### Structured Enquiry to Open Investigation

Pupils benefit from a progression in the level of support provided:
- Highly structured enquiries where variables and methods are specified
- Partially structured enquiries where pupils make some decisions
- Open enquiries where pupils formulate questions, design methods, and interpret findings

This progression allows pupils to focus initially on understanding concepts before applying them independently.

### Assessment for Learning

Regular assessment helps identify and address misconceptions:
- Exit tickets asking pupils to identify variables in novel contexts
- Peer discussion of what makes an investigation fair
- Analysis of example data to identify correlation and evaluate claims of causation
- Self-assessment of practical skills and understanding

Such assessment provides feedback for both pupils and teachers, allowing responsive teaching that addresses emerging difficulties.

## Conclusion

Working scientifically represents a substantial body of disciplinary knowledge that pupils must develop alongside their substantive science knowledge. The concepts explored in this knowledge base—types of enquiry, variables, fair testing, correlation and causation, evidence and theory, accuracy and precision—provide the foundation for pupils to think and work as scientists.

Effective teaching of these concepts requires explicit attention, appropriate progression, and opportunities for application to real scientific questions. When taught well, working scientifically enables pupils not only to conduct investigations but to understand why scientific methods take the forms they do, how scientific knowledge develops, and how to evaluate scientific claims critically. These capabilities are essential both for future scientists and for scientifically literate citizens engaging with an increasingly complex world.
