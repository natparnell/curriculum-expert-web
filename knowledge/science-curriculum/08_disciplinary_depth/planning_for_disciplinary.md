# Planning for Disciplinary Knowledge in Science

## Introduction

Planning for disciplinary knowledge in science requires a fundamental shift in how schools approach curriculum design. Ofsted's 2023 science subject report, *Finding the Optimum*, identified a critical weakness in science education: leaders' plans to develop pupils' disciplinary knowledge were typically far less developed than their plans for substantive knowledge. Too often, curriculum planning focused on identifying practical activities to complete rather than the knowledge pupils need to develop to become better at working scientifically.

This resource provides guidance on how to identify, sequence, and plan for disciplinary knowledge across primary and secondary science curricula, moving beyond the common "practical activities checklist" approach that Ofsted found limits pupil progress.

## Understanding Disciplinary Knowledge in Science

### Defining Disciplinary Knowledge

Disciplinary knowledge in science refers to what pupils learn about how to establish and refine scientific knowledge, including the processes, methods, and conventions through which scientific understanding is developed and validated. The National Curriculum describes this as "working scientifically" and it encompasses:

- The scientific method and experimental design
- Data collection, recording, and analysis
- Drawing conclusions from evidence
- Evaluating methods and validity
- Understanding the nature of scientific knowledge
- Recognising the role of prediction and hypothesis testing
- Appreciating how scientific understanding develops over time

Ofsted (2023) emphasises that disciplinary knowledge is distinct from procedural knowledge—the specific techniques needed to carry out practical work, such as using a thermometer or plotting a graph. While procedural knowledge is necessary, it is not sufficient for developing scientific understanding.

### The Distinction Between Knowledge Types

Understanding the relationship between different types of knowledge is essential for effective planning:

**Substantive knowledge** refers to the established facts, concepts, laws, and theories of science—what pupils know about the natural world. Examples include understanding that plants need light for photosynthesis, that forces can change the motion of objects, or that materials can exist as solids, liquids, and gases.

**Disciplinary knowledge** refers to how this substantive knowledge is established and refined—the processes of science. Examples include understanding why fair testing requires controlling variables, how to evaluate whether data supports a hypothesis, or why scientific conclusions are always provisional and subject to revision.

**Procedural knowledge** refers to the specific techniques and skills needed to carry out practical work—how to use equipment and follow methods. Examples include knowing how to read a scale on a measuring cylinder, how to set up a simple electric circuit, or how to use a hand lens safely.

A well-planned curriculum develops all three types of knowledge in concert, with disciplinary knowledge providing the intellectual framework that makes practical work meaningful rather than merely memorable.

## The Problem with the "Practical Checklist" Approach

### Ofsted's Findings

The 2023 Ofsted science subject report found that in too many schools, curriculum planning for working scientifically amounted to little more than creating a list of practical activities to be completed. This approach has significant limitations:

- It assumes pupils will acquire disciplinary knowledge simply by "doing" practical work
- It treats working scientifically as a set of generic "skills" that pupils pick up through repetition
- It focuses on activity completion rather than knowledge development
- It fails to specify what pupils should learn about how science works
- It results in pupils carrying out practical work without understanding its purpose

Research by the Wellcome Trust (2019) supports these findings, showing that nearly half of 14–16 year-olds carry out practical work simply by following instructions, without understanding its purpose. Merely completing an activity and recording results does not develop disciplinary knowledge.

### The Fallacy of Induction

The Royal Society of Chemistry highlights a common misconception in science teaching: the "fallacy of induction." This is the assumption that scientific understanding will automatically emerge from observation—that pupils will somehow deduce scientific principles simply by seeing phenomena. Teachers often underestimate the challenge of supporting pupils to understand what they observe, assuming that explanations will emerge naturally from hands-on experience.

Effective practical work must be both "hands on" and "minds on." Without explicit attention to the disciplinary knowledge underpinning practical activities, pupils may complete investigations without understanding:

- Why particular methods were chosen
- How evidence relates to conclusions
- The limitations of their data
- What makes a scientific claim valid or reliable

### Examination Evidence

Examination board feedback consistently highlights that pupils struggle to access questions relating to practical contexts, suggesting a lack of disciplinary understanding. Common weaknesses include:

- Difficulty identifying variables in experimental design
- Inability to evaluate the validity of conclusions
- Confusion about the difference between accuracy and precision
- Limited understanding of sample size and reliability
- Poor grasp of the relationship between hypothesis, prediction, and conclusion

These findings indicate that the practical checklist approach is not developing the disciplinary knowledge pupils need to succeed in science.

## Identifying Disciplinary Knowledge

### Starting with Purpose

The first step in planning for disciplinary knowledge is to determine the purpose of each practical activity. Before including any practical in the curriculum, teachers should ask:

- What prior knowledge, both substantive and disciplinary, do pupils need?
- What disciplinary knowledge will pupils develop during this activity?
- How does this activity build on previous learning?
- What comes next to build on this learning?
- How will we know if the practical has developed the intended knowledge?

For example, consider a simple dissolving experiment where pupils investigate whether salt or sugar dissolves faster in water at different temperatures. The purpose might be to develop understanding of:

**Substantive**: The concept that dissolving is a physical change where the solute becomes distributed throughout the solvent, with mass conserved.

**Disciplinary**: How to identify and control variables to create a fair test; how to recognise that patterns in data can support or challenge predictions; the difference between correlation and causation.

**Procedural**: How to use a thermometer correctly; how to measure volume using a measuring cylinder; how to record measurements in a table.

Without clarity about these different learning intentions, the activity risks becoming merely "doing a fair test about dissolving" rather than developing specific knowledge about how scientific investigations work.

### Deconstructing Working Scientifically

The National Curriculum identifies several aspects of working scientifically that provide a framework for identifying disciplinary knowledge:

**Observing Over Time**: Understanding how scientific understanding develops through sustained observation; recognising that some changes occur gradually; understanding the importance of systematic recording.

**Pattern Seeking**: Understanding how scientists identify regularities in data; recognising that patterns may suggest relationships but do not prove causation; understanding the difference between correlation and cause.

**Identifying, Classifying, and Grouping**: Understanding how scientists develop classification systems; recognising that classifications are human constructions that can change; understanding the criteria used for scientific classification.

**Comparative and Fair Testing**: Understanding what makes a test "fair"; knowing how to identify and control variables; recognising the importance of repeat measurements; understanding the difference between independent, dependent, and control variables.

**Research Using Secondary Sources**: Understanding how scientists use existing knowledge; recognising the importance of evaluating sources; knowing how to synthesise information from multiple sources.

Each of these enquiry types has associated disciplinary knowledge that needs to be explicitly identified, taught, and assessed.

### Identifying Knowledge Across Key Stages

Disciplinary knowledge should be mapped across the key stages to ensure progression. At each stage, teachers should identify:

**What pupils should know**: The specific disciplinary concepts pupils should understand (e.g., "a fair test requires that only one variable is changed at a time").

**What pupils should be able to do**: The applications of this knowledge (e.g., "pupils can identify the independent, dependent, and control variables in an investigation").

**Common misconceptions**: The typical misunderstandings pupils hold (e.g., "changing more than one variable is acceptable if you try to keep the others the same").

**Prior knowledge**: What pupils need to have learned previously (e.g., understanding of variables at a conceptual level).

**Future application**: How this knowledge will be used in subsequent learning (e.g., evaluating the validity of conclusions in GCSE required practicals).

## Sequencing Disciplinary Knowledge

### Sequencing Alongside Substantive Knowledge

Education Wales guidance on curriculum design emphasises the importance of sequencing disciplinary knowledge alongside substantive knowledge. Practical learning experiences should strengthen conceptual understanding, not simply engage learners in memorable tasks. This means:

- Identifying the disciplinary knowledge pupils need before engaging them in practical activities
- Planning sequences where practical work builds on prior disciplinary learning
- Ensuring that disciplinary knowledge is revisited and deepened over time
- Making explicit connections between substantive and disciplinary learning

For example, when teaching about states of matter (substantive), pupils might investigate changes of state (disciplinary). The sequence might be:

1. Learn that heating can cause changes of state (substantive)
2. Learn that fair testing requires controlling the amount of heat applied (disciplinary)
3. Carry out an investigation into melting points using controlled heating (combined application)
4. Evaluate whether the method produced valid data (disciplinary)
5. Apply understanding of controlled variables to a new context (transfer)

This integrated approach ensures that practical work serves the development of both substantive and disciplinary knowledge.

### Two Approaches to Sequencing

The Royal Society of Chemistry identifies two complementary approaches to sequencing disciplinary knowledge:

**Pupil-Centric Sequencing**: This approach considers what the typical pupil should know and be able to do by the end of a key stage or year. Teachers work backwards from these expectations to plan a sequence of learning opportunities.

Key questions for pupil-centric sequencing:
- What equipment should pupils be confident using by the end of Year 7?
- What practical skills and disciplinary knowledge should they have mastered?
- How will the planned activities develop this knowledge?
- Where are the opportunities to revisit and deepen understanding?
- How does this link to future learning at GCSE?

For example, by the end of Year 7, pupils should be able to use a measuring cylinder accurately. The sequence might be:
- Introduction: Teacher demonstrates correct use, including the meniscus and parallax error
- Development: Pupils use different sized cylinders and calculate what each division represents
- Application: Pupils select appropriate equipment and justify their choices
- Deepening: Pupils read scales on inverted cylinders and compare precision of different equipment
- Retrieval: Subsequent practicals require use of measuring cylinders, with questioning to reinforce understanding

**Practical-Centric Sequencing**: This approach deconstructs specific practical activities to identify what prior knowledge pupils need for success. It works backwards from a complex practical to map the prerequisite learning.

Key questions for practical-centric sequencing:
- What is the purpose of this practical activity?
- What procedural and disciplinary knowledge do pupils need?
- Where in the curriculum was this knowledge introduced and practised?
- What gaps need to be addressed before pupils attempt this activity?

For example, before attempting a GCSE required practical on rates of reaction, pupils need:
- Procedural: How to use a gas syringe or mass balance; how to measure time intervals
- Disciplinary: Understanding of variables and fair testing; how to recognise when data is anomalous; how to calculate and interpret rates from data
- Substantive: Understanding of collision theory; factors affecting reaction rates

Mapping these prerequisites helps identify where the curriculum needs to build towards the target practical.

### Building Towards Independence

An effective sequence builds pupils' capacity for independent scientific thinking. Early in the sequence, teachers may provide significant scaffolding:
- Explicitly stating the variables to be controlled
- Providing structured recording tables
- Modelling the process of drawing conclusions
- Offering sentence starters for evaluations

As pupils develop disciplinary knowledge, this scaffolding is gradually removed:
- Pupils identify variables independently
- Pupils design their own recording methods
- Pupils draw conclusions with minimal guidance
- Pupils evaluate using their own frameworks

This progression from guided to independent application should be planned explicitly, with teachers identifying when and how support will be reduced.

## Progression in Disciplinary Knowledge

### Primary to Secondary Continuity

Ofsted found that the removal of national tests in science at Key Stage 2 (in 2009) coincided with a relative decline in the performance of 10-year-old pupils in England. Many secondary schools reported that pupils arrived with significant gaps in both substantive and disciplinary knowledge. This makes careful planning for progression across the primary-secondary transition essential.

Key areas for primary-secondary continuity in disciplinary knowledge include:

**Variables and Fair Testing**: Primary pupils should develop a secure understanding of what makes a test fair and why controlling variables matters. Secondary teachers should not assume this knowledge but should audit and reinforce it before expecting independent application.

**Measurement and Data**: Primary pupils should understand that measurements involve uncertainty and that repeat readings increase confidence. Secondary teaching should build on this to develop understanding of precision, accuracy, and error.

**Evidence and Conclusion**: Primary pupils should learn that scientific claims require evidence and that conclusions should reference data. Secondary teaching should develop this into understanding of correlation, causation, and evaluation of evidence quality.

**Working Scientifically Across the Curriculum**: Primary science often uses contextualised enquiry questions (e.g., "Which material would make the best umbrella?"). Secondary teaching should help pupils recognise the underlying disciplinary knowledge that transfers across contexts.

### Key Stage 3 to Key Stage 4 Progression

The GCSE science specifications require pupils to develop and apply disciplinary knowledge in increasingly sophisticated ways. Key Stage 3 curriculum planning should prepare pupils for these demands:

**Experimental Design**: From identifying variables in simple investigations (KS3) to designing valid methods for complex investigations involving multiple variables and control groups (KS4).

**Data Analysis**: From recognising patterns in simple data sets (KS3) to processing and presenting complex data, identifying anomalous results, and calculating means from repeat readings (KS4).

**Conclusions and Evaluation**: From stating whether results support a prediction (KS3) to explaining the extent to which conclusions are valid, considering limitations of method and data, and suggesting improvements with justification (KS4).

**Scientific Thinking**: From understanding that scientific knowledge changes (KS3) to explaining how scientific understanding develops through the scientific community's evaluation of evidence (KS4).

### Developing Sophistication Over Time

Pupils' disciplinary understanding should become more sophisticated as they progress through the curriculum:

**Early Stage**: Pupils learn that science involves making observations, asking questions, and testing ideas. They understand that fair tests are important but may have a limited conception of why.

**Developing Stage**: Pupils understand that scientific knowledge is based on evidence and that methods need to be valid. They can identify variables and recognise that scientific claims can be tested.

**Secure Stage**: Pupils understand the relationship between hypothesis, prediction, and conclusion. They can evaluate the validity of methods and the strength of evidence. They recognise the provisional nature of scientific knowledge.

**Advanced Stage**: Pupils understand how scientific knowledge develops through the community's evaluation of evidence. They can design valid investigations for complex questions and critically evaluate the limitations of scientific methods.

Curriculum planning should ensure that pupils have opportunities to consolidate learning at each stage before moving to more sophisticated understanding.

## Practical Strategies for Curriculum Planning

### Creating a Disciplinary Knowledge Map

Schools should create a map of the disciplinary knowledge to be taught across the science curriculum. This should identify:

- The specific disciplinary concepts to be taught in each topic
- Where each concept is introduced, developed, and consolidated
- How disciplinary knowledge builds across the key stages
- The relationship between disciplinary and substantive knowledge
- Common misconceptions and how they will be addressed

This map should be a working document, regularly reviewed and refined as teachers gain insight into how pupils develop disciplinary understanding.

### Planning for Explicit Teaching

Disciplinary knowledge needs to be explicitly taught, not assumed to develop through osmosis. Planning should identify:

**What will be taught**: The specific disciplinary concept (e.g., "the importance of sample size in determining reliability").

**How it will be taught**: The pedagogical approach (e.g., teacher modelling, worked examples, pupil practice).

**When it will be taught**: The point in the sequence where this concept will be introduced.

**How it will be assessed**: The evidence that will show whether pupils have learned the concept.

**How it will be revisited**: The opportunities for retrieval and application in subsequent topics.

### Using Worked Examples

Worked examples are particularly effective for teaching disciplinary knowledge. Teachers can model the thinking process involved in scientific reasoning:

- "When I look at this data, I notice that..."
- "This suggests that... because..."
- "However, I need to be careful because..."
- "A valid conclusion would be..."

By making thinking explicit, teachers help pupils internalise the conventions and processes of scientific reasoning.

### Integrating Assessment

Assessment of disciplinary knowledge should be planned alongside teaching. This might include:

- Diagnostic questions to identify misconceptions before teaching
- Low-stakes quizzes to check understanding of specific concepts
- Practical assessments where pupils apply disciplinary knowledge
- Examination-style questions that require pupils to demonstrate understanding

Feedback should focus on disciplinary understanding as well as procedural accuracy—helping pupils see not just what they did wrong but why it matters for scientific validity.

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Time Pressures

Science departments often feel pressure to cover substantive content, leaving limited time for disciplinary knowledge.

**Solution**: Reframe practical work as essential for developing disciplinary knowledge, not an optional extra. Ensure that every practical has clear disciplinary learning intentions. Integrate disciplinary teaching with substantive content rather than treating it as separate.

### Challenge: Teacher Confidence

Some teachers, particularly non-specialists in primary schools or those teaching outside their specialism in secondary, may lack confidence in their own disciplinary knowledge.

**Solution**: Provide professional development focused on the nature of science and working scientifically. Develop shared resources that make disciplinary learning intentions explicit. Create opportunities for teachers to observe expert colleagues teaching disciplinary knowledge.

### Challenge: Assessment Demands

The emphasis on GCSE examination results can lead to a focus on teaching to the test rather than developing deep disciplinary understanding.

**Solution**: Show how secure disciplinary knowledge improves examination performance by enabling pupils to access practical-based questions more effectively. Use examination questions formatively to diagnose and address disciplinary weaknesses.

### Challenge: Resources and Equipment

Limited resources can make it difficult to provide the practical experiences that develop disciplinary knowledge.

**Solution**: Focus disciplinary learning on the thinking processes rather than the specific equipment. Use demonstrations, simulations, and secondary data when hands-on practicals are not possible. Prioritise practicals that develop the most important disciplinary concepts.

## Conclusion

Planning for disciplinary knowledge requires a deliberate and systematic approach to curriculum design. Moving beyond the "practical activities checklist" means identifying the specific knowledge pupils need to develop in order to become better at working scientifically, sequencing that knowledge across the curriculum, and planning for its explicit teaching and assessment.

The evidence from Ofsted, examination boards, and research organisations is clear: when disciplinary knowledge is treated as an afterthought or assumed to develop through osmosis, pupils fail to develop the scientific understanding they need. When it is planned for with the same care as substantive knowledge, pupils develop a more authentic and robust understanding of science as both a tradition of enquiry and a set of connected ideas.

School leaders and science teachers should:

1. Audit their current curriculum to identify whether disciplinary knowledge is explicitly planned or merely assumed
2. Create a map of the disciplinary knowledge to be taught across all key stages
3. Review every practical activity to ensure it has clear disciplinary learning intentions
4. Develop assessment approaches that capture pupils' disciplinary understanding
5. Provide professional development to build teacher confidence in teaching disciplinary knowledge

By taking these steps, schools can ensure that their science curriculum develops pupils who understand not just what we know, but how we know it—and who leave school with an authentic understanding of science that will serve them well in further study and beyond.
