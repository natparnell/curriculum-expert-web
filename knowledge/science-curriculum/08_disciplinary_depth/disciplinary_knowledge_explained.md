# Disciplinary Knowledge in Science Education

Disciplinary knowledge in science refers to what pupils learn about how scientific knowledge is established, refined, and validated. Unlike substantive knowledge—which encompasses the established facts, concepts, and theories of science (such as the water cycle, the structure of cells, or Newton's laws)—disciplinary knowledge concerns the methods, processes, and thinking patterns that scientists employ to generate reliable understanding of the natural world. Ofsted (2023) identifies this distinction as central to high-quality science education, noting that "leaders' plans to develop pupils' disciplinary knowledge were usually much less developed than their plans to develop pupils' substantive knowledge."

This knowledge base explores the nature of disciplinary knowledge in science, its progression from Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) through to Key Stage 5, the five types of scientific enquiry specified in the National Curriculum, and the common misconceptions that pupils and teachers hold about working scientifically.

## Defining Disciplinary Knowledge in Science

### The Distinction Between Substantive and Disciplinary Knowledge

The National Curriculum for science refers to "scientific knowledge" and "conceptual understanding" when describing what pupils should learn. Ofsted's science research review and subsequent subject report introduced the terminology of substantive and disciplinary knowledge to clarify two distinct but interconnected aspects of the subject.

**Substantive knowledge** encompasses the products of scientific enquiry: the facts, concepts, laws, and theories that constitute our current scientific understanding. This includes knowing that plants need light to grow, that forces can change the motion of objects, or that matter is composed of particles.

**Disciplinary knowledge** encompasses the processes and practices through which scientific knowledge is generated and validated. This includes understanding how to design a fair test, why repeat measurements improve reliability, how to evaluate the trustworthiness of data, and what constitutes evidence in science. As the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) guidance on improving secondary science notes, disciplinary knowledge is "the knowledge pupils need to develop to get better at working scientifically."

### The Relationship Between Knowledge Types

The two forms of knowledge are deeply interconnected. Pupils cannot effectively "work scientifically" without substantive knowledge to investigate, nor can they fully understand substantive concepts without appreciating how that knowledge was established. For example, understanding the concept of photosynthesis (substantive) is enhanced when pupils appreciate how experiments isolated the necessary conditions (disciplinary).

The 2023 Ofsted science subject report, "Finding the Optimum," found that in weaker provision, "pupils were studying science, often for long periods of time, without developing sufficient substantive and disciplinary knowledge." The report emphasised that teaching must ensure these two strands develop in tandem, with each reinforcing the other.

## The Five Types of Scientific Enquiry

The National Curriculum for Key Stages 1 and 2 specifies that pupils should engage with several "types of scientific enquiry." These are not merely activities but represent distinct disciplinary approaches, each with its own purposes, methods, and conventions.

### Observing Over Time

**Observing over time** involves making observations of changes that occur gradually. This might include monitoring the growth of plants, observing the phases of the moon, or tracking the decay of materials. Unlike other enquiry types, this approach recognises that some phenomena cannot be understood through a single observation but require sustained attention across hours, days, or months.

In the Early Years Foundation Stage, children begin developing this capacity through informal observation of natural changes—the growth of bean seeds, the melting of ice, or the changing weather. By Key Stage 1, pupils should learn to make systematic records, using simple diagrams, tally charts, or photographs to capture changes. The disciplinary knowledge here includes understanding that some scientific phenomena require longitudinal study, that regular observation intervals may be necessary, and that data gathered over time may reveal patterns not visible in isolated observations.

By Key Stage 2, pupils should understand that observations over time require decisions about measurement frequency, methods of recording, and identification of variables that might affect outcomes. They should begin to distinguish between expected variation (daily temperature fluctuations) and significant trends (gradual seasonal warming).

### Pattern Seeking

**Pattern seeking** involves observing and recording phenomena to identify relationships or trends where variables cannot be readily controlled. Unlike fair testing, where variables are manipulated and controlled, pattern seeking acknowledges that many scientific questions cannot be investigated through controlled experiments.

Examples include investigating whether taller children have larger feet, exploring the relationship between distance from the sea and rainfall patterns, or examining whether birds visit feeders more frequently in the morning or afternoon. The disciplinary knowledge here includes understanding that correlation does not imply causation, that sample size affects the reliability of patterns, and that anomalous data points require explanation.

Primary pupils often struggle with the distinction between pattern seeking and fair testing. Teachers report that children frequently attempt to control variables in pattern-seeking enquiries—for example, trying to ensure all children measured are the same age when investigating height and foot size—demonstrating a misconception that all scientific enquiry must involve controlled experiments.

### Identifying, Classifying, and Grouping

**Identifying, classifying, and grouping** involves recognising similarities and differences between objects, organisms, or phenomena and organising them into categories based on observable or inferred characteristics. This enquiry type underpins much of biology, from taxonomy to the identification of materials.

In EYFS and Key Stage 1, this begins with simple sorting activities based on single observable properties—colour, texture, size. The disciplinary knowledge here includes understanding that classification is based on shared characteristics, that different criteria can produce different groupings, and that some objects may belong to multiple categories.

By Key Stage 2, pupils should develop more sophisticated understanding. They should learn that classification systems can be hierarchical (kingdom, phylum, class), that some characteristics are more fundamental than others for classification purposes, and that scientists sometimes revise classification systems based on new evidence. They should also understand the difference between artificial classification (convenience-based) and natural classification (reflecting evolutionary relationships).

Common misconceptions in this area include the belief that classification is arbitrary rather than evidence-based, confusion about the distinction between living and non-living things, and the idea that animals are somehow "better" or more important than plants or microorganisms.

### Comparative and Fair Testing

**Comparative and fair testing** (controlled investigations) is often the most familiar type of scientific enquiry and frequently dominates primary science education to the exclusion of other approaches. Fair testing involves identifying variables, changing one independent variable while controlling others, and measuring the effect on a dependent variable.

The disciplinary knowledge required for fair testing is substantial and develops progressively:

**EYFS and Key Stage 1:** Pupils begin with simple comparisons—comparing how different materials feel, which objects float or sink. They learn that comparing requires looking at things systematically and that some comparisons are more helpful than others.

**Lower Key Stage 2:** Pupils should understand the concept of a "fair test"—that when comparing two things, everything else should be kept the same. They should learn to identify obvious variables and begin to recognise that repeating measurements helps ensure reliability.

**Upper Key Stage 2:** Pupils should use the terms independent, dependent, and control variables accurately. They should understand why repeat readings are necessary, how to calculate mean values, and how to recognise and handle anomalous results. They should begin to appreciate the difference between accuracy (closeness to true value) and precision (closeness of repeated measurements).

**Secondary (KS3-4):** Pupils develop understanding of control groups, placebo effects, and the importance of blinding in experimental design. They learn about sample size calculations and statistical significance.

Ofsted's subject report found that primary schools often prioritise "pupils carrying out different types of scientific enquiry," whereas secondary schools tend to prioritise "developing pupils' substantive knowledge." This discontinuity means that the disciplinary knowledge pupils develop in primary school is not always built upon effectively at secondary level.

### Research Using Secondary Sources

**Research using secondary sources** involves using existing data, information, and findings to answer questions that cannot be readily investigated through first-hand observation or experimentation. This includes consulting books, scientific databases, websites, and expert sources.

This enquiry type is often undervalued in primary science, with teachers sometimes viewing it as less "authentic" than practical investigation. However, it represents a crucial disciplinary practice. Many scientific questions—about the centre of the Earth, the behaviour of extinct species, or the effects of long-term climate change—cannot be investigated through classroom experimentation.

The disciplinary knowledge here includes understanding how to evaluate the reliability and validity of sources, distinguishing between primary and secondary sources, recognising that scientific understanding changes over time, and understanding the role of consensus and peer review in establishing scientific knowledge. By Key Stage 2, pupils should begin to understand that not all sources are equally trustworthy and that scientific claims require evidence.

## Progression in Disciplinary Knowledge: EYFS to KS5

### Early Years Foundation Stage (Ages 3-5)

In the EYFS, disciplinary knowledge develops through the "Understanding the World" area of learning, particularly within the "The Natural World" early learning goal. At this stage, the focus is on fostering curiosity and developing basic observational skills rather than explicit teaching of scientific methods.

Children should have opportunities to:
- Explore materials using their senses
- Notice changes in the natural world (seasons, growth, decay)
- Ask questions about what they observe
- Make simple predictions ("I think the ice will melt")
- Begin to test their ideas through play and exploration

The disciplinary foundations laid in EYFS include understanding that the world operates in regular, observable ways; that careful looking reveals more than casual glancing; and that materials and organisms have properties that can be discovered. Ofsted's subject report noted that effective Reception classes provide "regular opportunities for children to develop their understanding of the natural world."

### Key Stage 1 (Ages 5-7)

The Key Stage 1 National Curriculum introduces explicit expectations for "working scientifically." Pupils should be taught to:
- Ask simple questions and recognise that they can be answered in different ways
- Observe closely, using simple equipment
- Perform simple tests
- Identify and classify
- Use their observations and ideas to suggest answers to questions
- Gather and record data to help in answering questions

Progression from EYFS involves greater systematicity and the beginnings of formal recording. Pupils should begin to understand that:
- Questions can be answered through different types of enquiry
- Tests should be fair when making comparisons
- Observations can be recorded in various ways (drawings, tables, simple graphs)
- Scientists use evidence to support their conclusions

The Association for Science Education (ASE) emphasises that at this stage, teachers should model the language of enquiry, using terms such as "observe," "compare," "measure," and "record" explicitly so that pupils internalise this vocabulary as part of their developing disciplinary knowledge.

### Key Stage 2 (Ages 7-11)

Key Stage 2 represents substantial progression in disciplinary knowledge. The National Curriculum specifies that pupils should:
- Plan different types of scientific enquiries to answer questions
- Take measurements using a range of scientific equipment with increasing accuracy and precision
- Record data and results using scientific diagrams and labels, classification keys, tables, scatter graphs, bar and line graphs
- Use test results to make predictions
- Report and present findings from enquiries
- Identify scientific evidence that has been used to support or refute ideas or arguments

By the end of Key Stage 2, pupils should understand all five types of scientific enquiry and be able to select appropriate approaches for different questions. They should understand variables, why repeats are necessary, and how to present data effectively. The disciplinary knowledge developed in Key Stage 2 should provide a foundation for the more sophisticated understanding required at secondary level.

However, the 2023 Ofsted report found significant weaknesses in this progression. Inspectors observed that "in general, not enough consideration was given to identifying the disciplinary knowledge, including concepts, that are needed to work scientifically." Too often, the curriculum focused on identifying practical activities rather than on the specific disciplinary learning that each activity should develop.

### Key Stage 3 (Ages 11-14)

At Key Stage 3, disciplinary knowledge becomes more abstract and conceptually demanding. The National Curriculum continues to specify "working scientifically" as a separate strand, but secondary teachers often lack the primary experience to build upon.

Key developments at Key Stage 3 include:
- Understanding the relationship between hypotheses, predictions, and conclusions
- Appreciating the role of scientific models and their limitations
- Understanding concepts of reliability, validity, and accuracy in measurement
- Recognising that scientific explanations are provisional and subject to revision
- Understanding the distinction between correlation and causation
- Appreciating the social and ethical dimensions of scientific enquiry

The transition from Key Stage 2 to Key Stage 3 is particularly vulnerable to discontinuity. The Ofsted report noted that "COVID-19 prevented primary and secondary colleagues from working together to support pupils' transition," resulting in gaps and repetition. Secondary teachers may not recognise the disciplinary knowledge that pupils have developed in primary school, leading to unnecessary repetition or inappropriate assumptions about prior learning.

### Key Stage 4 and Beyond (Ages 14-18)

At GCSE and A level, disciplinary knowledge becomes highly sophisticated. Examination specifications for AQA, Edexcel, and OCR all include substantial emphasis on "working scientifically," which encompasses:

- Experimental design: formulating testable hypotheses, identifying variables, designing valid investigations
- Data handling: processing quantitative data, using statistical tests, handling uncertainties and errors
- Evaluation: assessing methodology, identifying sources of error, suggesting improvements
- Scientific communication: using appropriate conventions, acknowledging sources, structuring arguments

The disciplinary knowledge expected at this level includes understanding that scientific knowledge is constructed through a complex interplay of observation, theory, and experiment; that scientific consensus emerges through peer review and replication; and that science operates within social, economic, and ethical contexts.

## Common Misconceptions About Working Scientifically

### Pupil Misconceptions

Research has identified numerous misconceptions that pupils hold about the nature and practice of science. These often persist into secondary education and beyond if not explicitly addressed.

**The "scientific method" misconception:** Many pupils believe that there is a single, linear scientific method that all scientists follow—hypothesis, experiment, conclusion. This oversimplifies the diverse practices of science and ignores the role of observation, serendipity, and theoretical work. Teachers should emphasise that scientific enquiry takes many forms and that the five types of enquiry in the National Curriculum represent this diversity.

**The fair test obsession:** Primary pupils often believe that proper science must always involve a fair test with controlled variables. This leads them to struggle with pattern-seeking enquiries or research using secondary sources. Teachers should explicitly teach that different questions require different approaches.

**Hypotheses as guesses:** Pupils often view hypotheses as mere guesses rather than as predictions based on prior knowledge and understanding. Developing disciplinary knowledge involves helping pupils see that hypotheses emerge from existing substantive knowledge and are tested against evidence.

**The objectivity myth:** Many pupils believe that scientists are entirely objective and unaffected by their expectations or prior beliefs. This misconception can be addressed by discussing historical cases where scientists' expectations influenced their observations, or by conducting blinded investigations where pupils do not know what result to expect.

**Certainty in science:** Pupils may believe that scientific knowledge is absolute and unchanging. Teaching the history of science—how understanding of the solar system, the atom, or the causes of disease has evolved—helps pupils appreciate that scientific knowledge is provisional and subject to revision.

**The experiment as demonstration:** In weaker provision, pupils may view practical work as demonstrating known facts rather than as genuine enquiry. This "recipe-following" approach to practical work does not develop disciplinary knowledge. Pupils should have opportunities to design investigations, make decisions about methodology, and grapple with unexpected results.

### Teacher Misconceptions and Knowledge Gaps

The 2023 Ofsted report identified that "teachers were often not aware of the disciplinary knowledge that needs to be explicitly taught for pupils to work scientifically at an age-appropriate level." Common gaps include:

**Confusing activity with learning:** Teachers may assume that by engaging pupils in practical work, disciplinary knowledge will develop automatically. The report found that "too often, the focus was simply on identifying practical activities for pupils to complete" rather than on the specific disciplinary concepts and skills each activity should develop.

**Insecure understanding of variables:** Teachers sometimes struggle to identify all relevant variables in an investigation or confuse the purposes of control variables with control groups. This insecurity is transmitted to pupils.

**Weak assessment of disciplinary knowledge:** Assessment often focuses on substantive knowledge (what pupils know about science) with limited attention to disciplinary knowledge (how pupils understand scientific enquiry). The report found that "assessment rarely checked knowledge that pupils had learned in previous years" and that teachers rarely assessed whether pupils had developed disciplinary understanding.

**Assuming primary-secondary continuity:** Secondary teachers may underestimate the disciplinary knowledge pupils bring from primary school, while primary teachers may not understand how their teaching should prepare pupils for secondary science. The report recommended stronger cross-phase collaboration to address this.

## Teaching Implications and Pedagogical Approaches

### Explicit Teaching of Disciplinary Concepts

Disciplinary knowledge should be taught explicitly rather than assumed to develop through practical activity. This means:

- **Naming the knowledge:** Teachers should use precise terminology—independent variable, reliability, fair test, correlation—and ensure pupils understand these terms.
- **Making thinking visible:** Teachers should model their disciplinary reasoning, explaining why they have chosen a particular approach, why repeats are necessary, or how they are interpreting anomalous results.
- **Providing focused practice:** Pupils need repeated opportunities to apply disciplinary knowledge in different contexts, with decreasing scaffolding over time.

The Education Endowment Foundation's guidance report, "Improving Secondary Science," recommends the RADAAR approach for addressing misconceptions: **R**ecognise misconceptions, **A**nticipate them in planning, **D**iagnose them through assessment, **A**ddress them explicitly, and **R**eview understanding subsequently.

### Integrating Substantive and Disciplinary Knowledge

Effective science teaching integrates substantive and disciplinary knowledge so that each reinforces the other. For example:
- When teaching about plant growth (substantive), pupils might investigate the effects of light levels (disciplinary), reinforcing understanding of both the concept and the methods used to establish it.
- When learning about forces (substantive), pupils might evaluate historical experiments (disciplinary), appreciating how understanding of force has developed through enquiry.

The Ofsted report emphasised that in high-quality provision, "pupils had learned detailed and connected knowledge of the curriculum, and remembered what they had learned previously." This connection requires careful curriculum sequencing so that substantive and disciplinary knowledge develop together.

### Assessment of Disciplinary Knowledge

Assessment should attend to disciplinary knowledge with the same rigour as substantive knowledge. This includes:

- Assessing pupils' understanding of why particular approaches are appropriate for particular questions
- Evaluating pupils' ability to identify variables in given scenarios
- Checking whether pupils can explain why repeats improve reliability
- Assessing understanding of data presentation choices
- Evaluating pupils' capacity to critique experimental designs

Such assessment requires careful questioning and tasks that probe understanding rather than mere recall. Concept cartoons, predict-observe-explain activities, and evaluation of secondary data all provide opportunities to assess disciplinary understanding.

## Conclusion

Disciplinary knowledge—understanding how scientific knowledge is generated, validated, and refined—is as fundamental to science education as substantive knowledge of scientific concepts. The National Curriculum's specification of five types of scientific enquiry provides a framework for developing this knowledge progressively from EYFS through to Key Stage 5.

However, the 2023 Ofsted subject report identified significant weaknesses in how disciplinary knowledge is taught and assessed. Too often, it is assumed to develop automatically through practical activity, or it is neglected in favour of substantive content. Addressing these weaknesses requires explicit teaching of disciplinary concepts, careful sequencing to ensure progression, and rigorous assessment of pupils' developing understanding.

Key priorities for curriculum leaders include:
- Identifying the specific disciplinary knowledge pupils should learn at each stage
- Ensuring coverage of all five types of scientific enquiry, not just fair testing
- Planning for progression from EYFS through to KS5, with attention to primary-secondary transition
- Addressing common misconceptions explicitly through the RADAAR approach
- Assessing disciplinary knowledge with the same rigour as substantive knowledge

By attending to disciplinary knowledge with the same precision and rigour as substantive knowledge, schools can ensure that pupils develop not only scientific understanding but also scientific literacy—the capacity to evaluate evidence, distinguish correlation from causation, and appreciate both the power and the limitations of scientific enquiry.
