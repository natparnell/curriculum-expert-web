# Getting Better at Working Scientifically

Understanding how pupils develop expertise in scientific enquiry is central to effective science curriculum design. This knowledge file explores the progression from novice to expert scientific thinking, the pedagogical approaches that support this development, and the curriculum structures that enable pupils to build disciplinary knowledge systematically over time.

## Understanding Disciplinary Knowledge in Science

The distinction between substantive knowledge (the facts, concepts, and theories of science) and disciplinary knowledge (the ways of thinking and working scientifically) has become increasingly important in science education since the introduction of the 2014 National Curriculum for England. Ofsted's Research Review Series: Science (2021) and subsequent subject reports have reinforced that high-quality science education requires both forms of knowledge to be developed deliberately and sequentially.

### The Nature of Disciplinary Knowledge

Disciplinary knowledge in science encompasses the procedures, methods, and ways of thinking that enable scientists to generate, test, and refine knowledge about the natural world. The National Curriculum groups these under the umbrella of "working scientifically," which includes:

- **Questioning and hypothesising:** Formulating testable questions and predictions based on prior knowledge
- **Planning investigations:** Designing fair tests, identifying variables, and selecting appropriate methods
- **Gathering data:** Making systematic observations, using measurement accurately, and recording findings
- **Analysing and interpreting:** Identifying patterns, drawing conclusions, and evaluating evidence
- **Evaluating and improving:** Assessing the reliability of findings and suggesting refinements
- **Communicating findings:** Presenting data and arguments using scientific conventions

What distinguishes disciplinary knowledge from mere procedural competence is the understanding of *why* particular methods are appropriate, *when* different approaches should be used, and *how* scientific knowledge is validated within the scientific community.

### Why Disciplinary Knowledge Matters

Pupils who develop strong disciplinary knowledge are better equipped to:

- Engage critically with scientific claims they encounter in media and everyday life
- Design meaningful investigations rather than following cookbook procedures
- Understand science as a dynamic, evidence-based endeavour rather than a static body of facts
- Transfer scientific thinking to novel contexts and problems
- Appreciate the tentative yet robust nature of scientific knowledge

The Association for Science Education (ASE) emphasises that working scientifically skills must be developed progressively, with pupils building on prior learning and gradually taking more responsibility for independent enquiry as they move through the key stages.

## The Novice-to-Expert Journey

The development of scientific expertise follows a trajectory from dependent, context-bound performance toward flexible, transferable capability. Understanding this progression is essential for teachers seeking to support pupils effectively at each stage.

### Characteristics of Novice Scientific Thinkers

Novice learners in science typically exhibit several characteristic patterns:

**Reliance on surface features:** Novices tend to categorise problems and situations based on superficial characteristics rather than underlying scientific principles. A novice might classify investigations based on the equipment used or the topic studied rather than the type of enquiry being conducted.

**Fragmented knowledge:** Novices hold scientific concepts as isolated facts rather than connected networks of understanding. They may struggle to see how knowledge of variables connects to experimental design, or how observation skills underpin data interpretation.

**Procedural dependence:** Novice investigators require substantial scaffolding and explicit direction. They benefit from structured enquiry frames, sentence stems for predictions, and checklists for fair testing. Without this support, novices may struggle to initiate or sustain systematic investigation.

**Egocentric reasoning:** Younger pupils and those new to scientific thinking often struggle to distinguish between their own beliefs and evidence-based conclusions. They may interpret data to confirm prior expectations or disregard anomalous results that challenge their assumptions.

**Limited metacognition:** Novices have underdeveloped awareness of their own thinking processes. They may struggle to articulate why they made particular decisions during an investigation or to evaluate the quality of their own work against scientific criteria.

### Characteristics of Developing Scientific Thinkers

As pupils gain experience and quality instruction, they begin to demonstrate:

**Growing pattern recognition:** Developing thinkers start to recognise recurring structures in scientific problems. They can identify when an investigation is a fair test versus pattern-seeking, and select appropriate methods accordingly.

**Emerging connections:** Pupils begin linking different aspects of working scientifically. They understand that controlling variables is essential for fair testing, and that accurate measurement underpins reliable conclusions.

**Increasing independence:** With appropriate scaffolding, developing thinkers can plan and conduct investigations with decreasing teacher direction. They can use enquiry frameworks flexibly and adapt approaches when initial plans prove impractical.

**Beginning scientific reasoning:** Pupils start to base conclusions on evidence rather than expectation. They can identify when results support or challenge predictions and begin to consider alternative explanations.

### Characteristics of Expert Scientific Thinkers

Expert scientific thinkers—whether professional scientists or highly accomplished students—demonstrate:

**Deep, connected knowledge:** Experts organise scientific knowledge around core concepts and principles. They can quickly identify the type of enquiry appropriate to a question and draw on interconnected knowledge of methods, measurement, and analysis.

**Flexible application:** Experts transfer scientific thinking across contexts with relative ease. They recognise that the principles of fair testing apply equally in biology, chemistry, and physics, even when the specific content differs.

**Strategic reasoning:** Expert investigators plan systematically, anticipate problems, and adapt approaches in response to emerging findings. They make informed decisions about sample size, measurement precision, and control variables based on the specific investigation.

**Metacognitive awareness:** Experts monitor their own thinking and the quality of their work. They can evaluate the reliability of evidence, identify sources of error, and suggest meaningful improvements to investigation design.

**Scientific scepticism:** Experts maintain a healthy scepticism toward claims, including their own. They recognise the provisional nature of scientific conclusions and the importance of replication and peer review.

## Key Stages Progression in Working Scientifically

The National Curriculum outlines a two-step progression for working scientifically across Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2, with additional development at Key Stage 3. Understanding the specific expectations at each stage enables teachers to design curricula that build systematically toward expertise.

### Early Years Foundation Stage: Foundations of Enquiry

Although the EYFS does not explicitly label scientific activity as "working scientifically," the characteristics of effective learning and the understanding the world area of learning establish crucial foundations:

**Playing and exploring:** Young children develop curiosity through open-ended exploration of materials and phenomena. Adults support this by providing rich environments, asking open questions, and modelling curiosity.

**Active learning:** Sustained engagement with scientific activities builds concentration and persistence. Children learn to maintain focus on observation tasks and return to investigations over time.

**Creating and thinking critically:** Early experiences of cause and effect, prediction, and testing ideas lay groundwork for later scientific reasoning. Adults scaffold this by encouraging children to make predictions and compare outcomes with expectations.

The transition from EYFS to Key Stage 1 involves making these implicit experiences more explicit, gradually introducing scientific vocabulary and structured approaches to enquiry.

### Key Stage 1: Building Foundational Skills (Years 1-2)

At Key Stage 1, the National Curriculum identifies five types of scientific enquiry that pupils should experience:

**Observing changes over time:** Pupils learn to make systematic observations, record findings using simple drawings, photographs, and measurement, and identify patterns in how things change.

**Noting patterns:** Through activities such as sorting materials or exploring plant growth, pupils develop skills in identifying similarities, differences, and recurring features.

**Grouping and classifying:** Pupils learn to sort objects and living things using simple criteria, recognising that different classification systems may be appropriate for different purposes.

**Carrying out simple comparative tests:** Introduction to fair testing begins with straightforward comparisons where only one variable changes. Pupils learn to identify what should stay the same and what will be observed.

**Using secondary sources:** Pupils begin to find information in books and digital sources, understanding that scientists also learn from the work of others.

The emphasis at this stage is on experience and immersion. Pupils should encounter scientific phenomena first-hand, develop vocabulary for describing observations, and begin to recognise that there are systematic ways of finding answers to questions.

### Key Stage 2: Developing Independence (Years 3-6)

Key Stage 2 builds upon the foundations laid in Key Stage 1, with increasing expectations for independent application of working scientifically skills:

**Planning enquiries with greater autonomy:** Upper Key Stage 2 pupils should increasingly take responsibility for planning investigations, including identifying variables, selecting appropriate equipment, and deciding how to record data.

**Selecting enquiry types:** Pupils learn to choose the most appropriate type of enquiry for different questions, understanding that fair testing suits some questions while observation or research suits others.

**Taking accurate measurements:** Progression in measurement includes selecting appropriate units and instruments, understanding precision and reliability, and recognising sources of measurement error.

**Recording and presenting data:** Pupils develop skills in constructing tables, choosing appropriate graphs, and presenting findings using scientific conventions.

**Drawing conclusions with evidence:** The expectation shifts from simply stating results to explaining what results show, using evidence to support claims, and identifying when evidence is insufficient or inconclusive.

**Evaluating and refining:** Upper Key Stage 2 pupils should evaluate the reliability of their findings, identify sources of error or uncertainty, and suggest improvements to investigation design.

The ASE's Primary Science Skills and How to Teach Them resource provides detailed progression frameworks for each aspect of working scientifically, supporting teachers to plan systematic development across the key stage.

### Key Stage 3: Consolidating Expertise (Years 7-9)

At Key Stage 3, the working scientifically objectives become more sophisticated:

**Scientific attitudes:** Pupils develop understanding of scientific objectivity, the importance of replication, and the role of peer review in establishing reliable knowledge.

**Experimental skills and investigations:** Expectations for independence increase further, with pupils planning investigations that produce valid and reliable data, identifying and controlling variables with precision, and selecting appropriate techniques and equipment.

**Analysis and evaluation:** Pupils learn to identify patterns in complex data, use mathematical representations where appropriate, and evaluate the strength of evidence rigorously.

**Scientific communication:** The conventions of scientific reporting—including abstract, method, results, and discussion sections—are introduced and practised.

The transition to GCSE builds upon this foundation, with working scientifically integrated throughout the subject content and assessed through practical endorsements and written examinations.

## Curriculum Sequencing for Disciplinary Knowledge

Effective curriculum design for working scientifically requires careful attention to sequencing—ensuring that pupils encounter disciplinary knowledge in an order that builds systematically toward expertise.

### Principles of Effective Sequencing

**Spiral curriculum:** Working scientifically skills should be revisited repeatedly across topics and key stages, with each encounter adding depth and sophistication. A pupil's understanding of fair testing, for example, should deepen each time they encounter it, moving from teacher-directed simple comparisons toward independently designed complex investigations.

**Preparing the mental environment:** Before pupils can engage meaningfully with a working scientifically skill, they need appropriate substantive knowledge. Attempting to investigate electrical circuits before understanding conductors and insulators, for example, limits the sophistication of questions pupils can formulate and investigations they can design.

**Concrete to abstract:** Early encounters with working scientifically should emphasise concrete, observable phenomena. Abstract concepts such as variables, reliability, and validity become meaningful only when grounded in substantial practical experience.

**Modelling and scaffolding:** Expert scientific thinking should be modelled explicitly, with teachers thinking aloud about investigation design, decision-making, and evaluation. Scaffolds such as planning frames, writing structures, and evaluation prompts should be gradually removed as pupils develop competence.

**Deliberate practice:** Developing expertise requires repeated, purposeful practice with feedback. Working scientifically skills should not be assumed to develop automatically through doing science; they require explicit teaching, practice, and refinement.

### Integrating Disciplinary and Substantive Knowledge

A common pitfall in science teaching is treating working scientifically as a separate strand from content knowledge. Research evidence and inspection findings consistently show that disciplinary knowledge is most effectively developed when integrated with substantive topics:

**Contextualised enquiry:** When pupils investigate questions that arise naturally from their study of a topic, both substantive and disciplinary knowledge develop together. Investigating which material makes the best thermal insulator connects meaningfully to learning about materials and heat transfer.

**Purposeful application:** Working scientifically skills are better retained when pupils understand their purpose. Measuring temperature becomes meaningful when it answers a genuine question about which conditions affect evaporation rates.

**Interconnected assessment:** Assessment should evaluate both what pupils know and what they can do scientifically. Written assessments can probe understanding of why particular methods are appropriate, while practical assessments evaluate procedural competence and scientific reasoning.

### Common Sequencing Challenges

Several challenges commonly arise in sequencing working scientifically:

**The coverage trap:** Attempting to cover every aspect of working scientifically in every topic leads to superficial treatment. Better to focus on developing specific skills deeply in particular topics while maintaining other skills through regular application.

**The skills-only lesson:** Isolated lessons focused solely on working scientifically skills, divorced from substantive content, often fail to engage pupils or develop transferable capability. Skills development should be embedded within meaningful scientific contexts.

**Assuming transfer:** Pupils do not automatically transfer working scientifically skills learned in one context to new situations. Explicit teaching should address how skills apply across different topics and highlight the underlying principles that enable transfer.

**Inconsistent progression:** Without careful whole-school planning, pupils may encounter the same introductory-level treatment of working scientifically year after year. Curriculum mapping should ensure clear progression in complexity and independence.

## Pedagogical Approaches for Developing Expertise

The transition from novice to expert scientific thinker requires intentional pedagogical choices. Research evidence and professional guidance from organisations such as the ASE and Education Endowment Foundation point to several high-impact approaches.

### Explicit Instruction and Modelling

Working scientifically skills benefit from explicit teaching that makes thinking visible:

**Worked examples:** Showing pupils completed investigations with commentary on the decision-making process helps them understand expert thinking. This might include examples of well-designed and poorly-designed investigations, with discussion of strengths and weaknesses.

**Live modelling:** Teachers modelling scientific thinking in real-time—talking through decisions about variables, measurement approaches, and data interpretation—makes expert thinking accessible to novices.

**Process mnemonics:** Structured approaches such as the PLAN (Predict, Layout, Analysis, Narrative) framework for investigation planning provide scaffolding that supports novices while remaining applicable as expertise develops.

### Scaffolded Enquiry

The degree of scaffolding provided should match pupils' developing expertise:

**Structured enquiry:** Novices benefit from investigations where the question, method, and analysis approach are provided. The focus is on developing procedural competence and understanding of why particular approaches are used.

**Guided enquiry:** As competence develops, pupils take increasing responsibility for aspects of the investigation. The teacher might provide the question but support pupils to design the method, or provide data for pupils to analyse and interpret.

**Open enquiry:** Expert scientific thinkers can work with minimal scaffolding, formulating their own questions, designing investigations independently, and evaluating their own work against scientific criteria.

### Metacognitive Strategies

Developing awareness of one's own thinking is essential for expertise:

**Self-explanation:** Prompting pupils to explain why they made particular decisions during an investigation develops metacognitive awareness. Questions such as "Why did you choose to measure that?" or "How do you know your data is reliable?" encourage reflection.

**Evaluation routines:** Structured approaches to evaluation—considering reliability, validity, precision, and sources of error—help pupils develop systematic habits of self-assessment.

**Comparative evaluation:** Asking pupils to compare their own investigations with exemplars or peer work develops critical awareness of quality in scientific enquiry.

### Dialogue and Argumentation

Scientific knowledge develops through discourse and critique within the scientific community. Classroom approaches that mirror this support disciplinary development:

**Exploratory talk:** Activities that require pupils to discuss scientific questions, share predictions, and justify reasoning develop scientific discourse capabilities.

**Argumentation:** Structured activities where pupils evaluate evidence, construct arguments, and critique the arguments of others develop understanding of how scientific knowledge is validated.

**Peer review:** Processes where pupils review and provide feedback on each other's investigation plans or reports develop critical evaluation skills and understanding of scientific standards.

### Formative Assessment

Ongoing assessment that informs teaching is essential for developing expertise:

**Diagnostic assessment:** Understanding pupils' current thinking about working scientifically—including misconceptions—enables targeted teaching. This might include pre-assessment of planning skills or analysis of written conclusions to identify reasoning patterns.

**Hinge questions:** In-lesson questions that reveal whether pupils have grasped key concepts enable teachers to adapt instruction responsively. A hinge question might assess whether pupils understand why controlling variables matters in a fair test.

**Feedback on process:** Feedback should address not just the product of scientific enquiry but the process—praising effective decision-making, highlighting reasoning strengths, and identifying specific areas for development in scientific thinking.

## Assessment of Disciplinary Knowledge

Assessing working scientifically presents particular challenges because it involves both practical capability and conceptual understanding. Effective assessment approaches evaluate both dimensions.

### Practical Assessment

Direct observation of pupils conducting investigations provides authentic evidence of procedural competence:

**Structured practical assessments:** Standardised tasks where pupils complete specific investigations enable comparison of capability across pupils and over time. The teacher observes and evaluates performance against criteria.

**Portfolio approaches:** Collections of pupils' practical work over time provide evidence of progression and enable assessment of the quality of investigation planning, data collection, and analysis.

**Practical endorsements:** At GCSE, the practical endorsement requires demonstration of competency in specific techniques and investigative approaches, assessed through ongoing teacher observation.

### Written Assessment

Written assessments can effectively probe conceptual understanding of working scientifically:

**Scenario-based questions:** Presenting pupils with descriptions of investigations and asking them to evaluate design, suggest improvements, or interpret findings tests understanding of why particular approaches are used.

**Data analysis tasks:** Providing data sets for pupils to analyse, graph, and interpret assesses analytical skills in a standardised, comparable format.

**Explanatory writing:** Asking pupils to explain the reasoning behind investigation choices reveals understanding of disciplinary principles.

### Assessment for Learning

Day-to-day assessment practices support ongoing development:

**Success criteria:** Clear, shared criteria for quality in working scientifically help pupils understand expectations and evaluate their own work.

**Peer and self-assessment:** Structured approaches where pupils assess their own or peers' work against criteria develop critical awareness and metacognition.

**Responsive teaching:** Using assessment information to adapt teaching—providing additional support where needed or increasing challenge where pupils demonstrate readiness—ensures that instruction matches developing expertise.
