# Building on Primary Science: Transition and Curriculum Continuity

Understanding what pupils learn in primary science is essential for secondary teachers who want to avoid unnecessary repetition while ensuring genuine progression. This document explores the statutory content of the Key Stage 2 science curriculum, common transition challenges, and evidence-informed strategies for building effectively on pupils' prior learning.

## What Pupils Actually Learn in Primary Science

### The Statutory Framework

The National Curriculum for science at Key Stages 1 and 2 (DfE, 2015) sets out programmes of study year by year. By the end of Year 6, pupils are expected to have developed both **substantive knowledge** (the facts, concepts, and theories of science) and **disciplinary knowledge** (how science works, including working scientifically skills).

Ofsted's "Finding the Optimum" science subject report (2023) noted that whilst 83% of Year 6 pupils achieved the expected standard in science during 2019, there are concerns that the removal of national science tests at Key Stage 2 in 2009 led to a decline in the status of science in some primary schools. This has significant implications for what secondary teachers can reasonably assume about incoming Year 7 pupils.

### Substantive Knowledge by the End of Year 6

#### Biology

By the end of Key Stage 2, pupils should understand:

- **Living things and their habitats**: Classification of living things into broad groups (micro-organisms, plants, animals), including the use of classification keys. Pupils learn that living things can be grouped according to shared characteristics and that classification has changed over time.

- **Animals including humans**: The structure and function of the circulatory system, the impact of diet, exercise, drugs, and lifestyle on bodily function, and the ways nutrients and water are transported within animals. They also learn about human development from birth to old age.

- **Evolution and inheritance**: How living things have changed over time, how fossils provide information about living things from the past, and how animals and plants are adapted to their environment. Pupils should understand that adaptation may lead to evolution.

#### Chemistry

- **Properties and changes of materials**: Pupils know that some materials will dissolve in liquid to form a solution and can describe how to recover a substance from a solution. They understand that dissolving, mixing, and changes of state are reversible changes, whilst burning and reacting with acid are irreversible. They can use knowledge of solids, liquids, and gases to decide how mixtures might be separated.

- **States of matter**: Whilst taught at lower Key Stage 2, this is reinforced through the particle model—though primary pupils are not expected to use terms like "particles" or "atoms" explicitly.

#### Physics

- **Electricity**: Pupils can associate the brightness of a lamp or volume of a buzzer with the number and voltage of cells used. **Critically, they are only expected to learn about series circuits, not parallel circuits.** They can use recognised symbols when representing simple circuits in diagrams.

- **Forces**: Gravity, air resistance, water resistance, and friction. Pupils understand that mechanisms (including levers, pulleys, and gears) allow a smaller force to have a greater effect.

- **Light**: How light travels in straight lines, how we see objects, and how shadows are formed. They understand that light travels from light sources to our eyes or from light sources to objects and then to our eyes.

- **Earth and space**: The movement of the Earth and other planets relative to the Sun, the movement of the Moon relative to the Earth, and the Earth's rotation to explain day and night and the apparent movement of the Sun across the sky.

- **Sound**: How sounds are made through vibrations, how they travel through a medium, and how pitch and volume are affected by properties of the sound source and medium.

### Working Scientifically Skills

The Association for Science Education (ASE) identifies seven enquiry skills that pupils develop through primary science:

1. **Asking questions** – Pupils learn to formulate testable questions and identify what they want to find out.

2. **Making predictions** – They understand that predictions are based on prior knowledge and scientific understanding.

3. **Setting up tests** – By Year 6, pupils should be able to plan different types of scientific enquiries, including fair tests, comparative tests, and observations over time.

4. **Observing and measuring** – Pupils use a range of equipment to make observations and measurements, becoming increasingly systematic and accurate.

5. **Recording data** – They use tables, graphs, and other methods to record findings, including the use of computing where appropriate.

6. **Interpreting and communicating results** – Pupils identify patterns in data, draw conclusions, and use scientific vocabulary to explain their findings.

7. **Evaluating** – They consider the reliability of their results and suggest improvements to their investigations.

Ofsted's 2023 report found that primary pupils often have significant practical experience and hands-on science, but this varies considerably between schools. The COVID-19 pandemic also prevented primary and secondary colleagues from working together to support transition, creating gaps in some pupils' scientific knowledge.

## The Problem of Repetition in Year 7

### Ofsted's "Wasted Years" Warning

In September 2015, Ofsted published its influential report "Key Stage 3: the Wasted Years?" which highlighted that "too often, the transition from primary to secondary school was poorly handled. Consequently, the gains made by pupils at primary school were not embedded and developed at Key Stage 3."

The report identified that curriculum repetition across phases was accepted as normal in too many schools. Pupils arriving in Year 7 often found themselves covering topics they had already studied in primary school, presented in ways that felt like simple repetition rather than progression.

### Why Repetition Happens

Several factors contribute to unnecessary repetition in Year 7 science:

**Lack of Communication Between Phases**

Secondary science teachers often have limited understanding of what primary pupils have actually learned. As the Chartered College of Teaching notes, "Without much awareness from secondary teachers as to what is required by the end of Key Stage 2, no matter how much energy we've given to writing that scheme of work for Year 7, we're unintentionally doing a disservice to our students."

**Assessment Information Gaps**

Since the removal of national Key Stage 2 science tests, secondary schools receive only teacher assessment data for science. This varies in reliability and detail, making it difficult for Year 7 teachers to identify what pupils actually know.

**Different Pedagogical Approaches**

Primary science is typically taught by generalist teachers through integrated topics, whilst secondary science is taught by subject specialists in discrete lessons. This shift can mask underlying content overlap when the presentation feels different.

**The "Refresh" Assumption**

Some schools deliberately repeat content as a "refresh" on the assumption that pupils have forgotten what they learned in primary school. However, Ofsted warns that this approach can be demotivating and fails to build progression.

### Consequences of Poor Transition

When transition is poorly handled:

- Pupils become bored and disengaged when they recognise content they have already mastered
- Valuable curriculum time is wasted that could be spent on new learning
- Gaps in knowledge are not identified and addressed
- The gains made at primary school are not built upon
- Pupils' attitudes to science can deteriorate just as they begin secondary education

## Strategies for Building on Primary Science

### Understanding Primary Science First

Secondary teachers need explicit training on the Key Stage 2 science curriculum. The CogSciSci network has produced resources explicitly designed to help secondary teachers understand what primary pupils learn, including curriculum intent documents from primary practitioners.

Key knowledge for Year 7 teachers includes:
- The specific statutory content of the KS2 programmes of study
- The types of practical work primary pupils experience
- The vocabulary and language primary pupils are expected to use
- The enquiry skills pupils have developed

### Diagnostic Assessment on Entry

Rather than assuming what pupils know or simply repeating content "to be safe," effective schools use diagnostic assessment at the beginning of Year 7. This should:

- Focus on key concepts from the KS2 curriculum that are prerequisites for KS3 learning
- Include practical tasks that reveal understanding, not just factual recall
- Identify both what pupils know and common misconceptions they hold
- Inform planning so that teaching can genuinely build on prior learning

The Primary Science Teaching Trust (PSTT) suggests that secondary schools should "be ruthless, on your Year 6 teachers' behalf, filtering out things that will go straight in the bin and focusing solely on what secondary schools need." This requires effective communication channels between feeder primary schools and the secondary school.

### Avoiding Repetition Whilst Ensuring Progression

#### Biology Examples

**Classification**: Primary pupils learn to classify living things into broad groups using simple keys. Year 7 should build on this by introducing the more complex hierarchical classification system (domain, kingdom, phylum, etc.) and exploring why classification has changed over time (evolution of scientific understanding).

**Human body systems**: Primary pupils learn about the circulatory system. Year 7 can build on this by exploring the interaction between different body systems, cellular respiration, and the effects of lifestyle choices at a more sophisticated level.

#### Chemistry Examples

**States of matter**: Primary pupils learn about solids, liquids, and gases and observe changes of state. Year 7 should introduce the particle model explicitly, explaining states of matter in terms of particle arrangement and behaviour—something primary pupils observe but do not explain at the particle level.

**Separating mixtures**: Primary pupils learn simple separation techniques (filtration, evaporation). Year 7 can introduce distillation, chromatography, and the underlying scientific principles in more depth.

#### Physics Examples

**Electricity**: This is a critical area for avoiding repetition. Primary pupils only study series circuits. Year 7 teachers should introduce parallel circuits, current in series and parallel circuits, resistance, and the quantitative relationships (V=IR) rather than repeating series circuit work.

**Forces**: Primary pupils learn about gravity, friction, and simple mechanisms. Year 7 should introduce force as a vector quantity, balanced and unbalanced forces, resultant forces, and Newton's Laws—not simply repeat the same activities with older pupils.

### The Pedagogical Bridge

The ASE has researched what it calls the "pedagogical bridge" between primary and secondary science. Their work identified that improving transition requires developing inclusive teaching and learning approaches that improve the consistency of pupils' experience across the transition.

Key elements include:

- Using lesson structures and methods that primary pupils are familiar with initially, then gradually introducing secondary approaches
- Ensuring practical work in Year 7 genuinely extends what pupils experienced in primary school (bunsen burners, more sophisticated equipment, more complex investigations)
- Maintaining the emphasis on working scientifically that was strong in primary, rather than focusing only on content coverage
- Providing clear progression in the complexity of scientific vocabulary and explanations

### Communication and Collaboration

The most effective transition approaches involve structured communication between primary and secondary teachers:

- **Transition units**: Some schools use shared units of work that span Year 6 and Year 7, with explicit handover of information about what pupils have covered
- **Joint professional development**: Primary and secondary teachers observing each other's science lessons and discussing curriculum progression
- **Pupil work sampling**: Year 7 teachers looking at examples of Year 6 pupils' science work to understand the level of understanding and presentation they can expect
- **Common assessment frameworks**: Using shared approaches to assessing working scientifically so that information transfers more meaningfully

## Managing the Transition Period

### Year 6 to Year 7 Handover

Ofsted's 2023 report noted that COVID-19 disrupted established transition practices. Effective schools have rebuilt these, ensuring that:

- Information about pupils' science learning (not just attainment grades) is shared
- Primary teachers identify pupils with particular strengths or gaps in science
- Transition activities include science elements that excite pupils about secondary science
- Year 7 teachers know which primary schools have particularly strong or weak science provision

### The First Half-Term of Year 7

Research suggests that the first half-term of Year 7 is critical for establishing expectations and identifying gaps. Recommended approaches include:

- Starting with topics that naturally extend primary learning (particle model building on states of matter, cells building on body systems) rather than topics that risk repetition
- Using the initial weeks to assess working scientifically skills, not just content knowledge
- Being explicit with pupils about how secondary science will be different from and build upon primary science
- Identifying early any pupils whose primary science experience was limited (for example, due to pandemic disruptions or teaching quality issues)

### Addressing Gaps Without Slowing Down

When diagnostic assessment reveals gaps in pupils' knowledge, schools need strategies to address these without holding back the whole cohort:

- **Targeted intervention**: Small group or individual support for pupils with significant gaps
- **Independent study resources**: Providing materials that pupils can use to catch up on specific topics outside lessons
- **Differentiation within lessons**: Ensuring that whilst the whole class progresses, support is available for those who need it
- **Summer school provision**: Some schools offer transition summer schools focused on key subject knowledge

## Conclusion

Building effectively on primary science requires secondary teachers to have a clear understanding of what pupils have actually learned in Key Stage 2, not just what they assume they have learned. The Key Stage 2 curriculum provides substantial foundations in biology, chemistry, and physics, alongside well-developed working scientifically skills in many pupils.

The key to successful transition lies in genuine progression rather than repetition. Year 7 curricula should extend and deepen primary learning, introducing more sophisticated concepts, more complex practical work, and more demanding scientific reasoning. This requires communication between phases, diagnostic assessment on entry, and careful curriculum design that takes account of the primary foundations.

As the Ofsted handbook makes clear, there should be "a synergy between key stage 2 and 3 in relation to ensuring there is seamless learning across the transition bridge." Achieving this synergy is one of the most important challenges for science curriculum leaders in secondary schools.
