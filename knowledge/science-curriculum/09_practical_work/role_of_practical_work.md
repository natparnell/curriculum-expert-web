# The Role of Practical Work in Science Education

## Introduction

Practical work has long been regarded as a defining feature of science education. For many teachers, students, and parents, science lessons are synonymous with experiments, demonstrations, and hands-on activities. Yet despite its central place in the science curriculum, the effectiveness of practical work as a teaching and learning strategy has been the subject of considerable debate within the science education research community.

This knowledge base entry examines the role of practical work through the influential research of Robin Millar and Ian Abrahams, whose work has fundamentally shaped our understanding of when and how practical work contributes to student learning. Drawing on their analytical framework and the broader research literature, we explore the purposes of practical work, the conditions under which it proves effective, and the common pitfalls that can render it merely "hands-on" rather than "minds-on."

## The Purposes of Practical Work

### Multiple Aims, Multiple Tensions

Practical work in science serves multiple purposes, and these purposes often exist in productive tension with one another. Millar (2004) identifies three broad categories of aims that practical work typically addresses:

**Illustrative purposes** — to help students observe phenomena and establish links between the material world and scientific ideas. This involves making abstract concepts concrete, allowing students to see scientific principles in action.

**Procedural purposes** — to help students learn how to use scientific equipment and develop laboratory techniques. This includes developing manipulative skills, learning to handle apparatus safely, and becoming proficient in measurement and observation.

**Investigative purposes** — to help students understand the nature of scientific enquiry, including how to design investigations, collect and analyse data, and draw evidence-based conclusions.

The challenge for teachers is that no single practical activity can serve all these purposes equally well. A "recipe-following" demonstration may effectively illustrate a concept but contribute little to students' understanding of scientific enquiry. Conversely, an open-ended investigation may develop enquiry skills while leaving students unclear about the conceptual point of the activity.

### The Engagement Rationale

A frequently cited justification for practical work is its motivational value. Teachers often report that students enjoy practical work and that it maintains engagement with science. While engagement is valuable, Millar and Abrahams (2008) caution against conflating enjoyment with learning. Students may be actively engaged in manipulating equipment and following procedures without necessarily engaging cognitively with the underlying scientific concepts.

The engagement rationale becomes problematic when it is used to justify practical activities that have no clear learning purpose beyond keeping students occupied. As the Ofsted Science Subject Report (2023) notes, "pupils struggled to recall what they had learned from practical work. They could only remember the activity." The goal must be practical work that is both engaging and educationally purposeful.

## Millar's Framework for Practical Work Effectiveness

### The Central Question: Does Practical Work Really Work?

In their seminal study, "Does Practical Work Really Work?" (2008), Abrahams and Millar investigated the effectiveness of practical work by analysing 25 typical science lessons involving practical activities in English secondary schools. Their research used a model of effectiveness that has become foundational for understanding when practical work succeeds and when it fails.

### The Analytical Framework

Millar's framework assesses practical work effectiveness by examining two key dimensions:

**1. The Learning Demand of the Task**

The learning demand refers to what students must understand to make sense of the practical activity. This includes:
- The scientific concepts the practical is designed to illustrate
- The relationship between what is observed and what is to be learned
- The procedures and techniques required to carry out the activity

Millar distinguishes between tasks with high learning demand (where significant conceptual understanding is required to make sense of observations) and low learning demand (where the purpose is more straightforward, such as learning a technique or observing a phenomenon).

**2. The Support for Student Thinking**

The second dimension examines the extent to which the practical task provides support for the thinking required. This includes:
- Clear framing of the activity's purpose
- Structured opportunities to connect observations to concepts
- Teacher questioning that directs attention to key learning points
- Written materials that guide interpretation of results

Effective practical work occurs when there is appropriate alignment between the learning demand of the task and the support provided for student thinking.

### Key Findings from the Research

Abrahams and Millar's study revealed several important patterns:

**Many practical activities were ineffective.** In a significant proportion of observed lessons, students carried out practical procedures successfully but failed to make the intended conceptual connections. They could describe what they had done but not what they had learned from it.

**Recipe-following dominated.** Most practical work followed a "recipe" format where students followed step-by-step instructions without necessarily understanding the purpose of each step or the overall activity. This approach developed procedural fluency but often failed to develop conceptual understanding.

**Teacher talk was crucial.** The most effective practical work was characterised by carefully structured teacher talk before, during, and after the activity. This talk explicitly connected the practical to the concepts being learned.

**Time for thinking was often insufficient.** Many lessons moved rapidly from practical activity to the next topic without adequate time for students to process what they had observed and connect it to their developing understanding.

## When Practical Work Helps Learning

### Conditions for Effectiveness

Research indicates that practical work is most likely to contribute to learning under specific conditions:

**1. Clear Conceptual Purpose**

Effective practical work has a clearly defined conceptual purpose that is explicit to both teacher and students. Teachers should be able to articulate what students should understand as a result of the activity that they would not understand without it. This purpose should be shared with students at the outset.

**2. Attention to the "Minds-On" Element**

Practical work must engage students cognitively as well as physically. This means:
- Students should be required to predict outcomes before conducting the practical
- Observations should be framed as evidence for or against hypotheses
- Results should be explicitly connected to the concepts being learned
- Discussion should focus on interpretation, not just description

**3. Appropriate Scaffolding**

The level of guidance provided should match the learning demand of the task. High-demand practicals require more scaffolding, including:
- Structured observation prompts
- Guided interpretation questions
- Explicit links between observations and concepts
- Teacher modelling of scientific thinking

For lower-demand practicals (such as technique development), detailed instructions are appropriate and necessary.

**4. Adequate Time for Reflection**

Time spent after the practical is as important as time spent during it. Students need opportunities to:
- Review and consolidate their observations
- Connect practical experiences to theoretical understanding
- Articulate their learning in scientific language
- Address any discrepancies between predictions and observations

**5. Skilled Teacher Intervention**

The teacher's role during practical work is critical. Effective teachers:
- Circulate and engage students in dialogue about their observations
- Ask probing questions that direct attention to key features
- Address misconceptions as they arise
- Use the practical as a shared reference point for explanation

### Types of Practical Work That Work Well

Certain types of practical activity are consistently associated with positive learning outcomes:

**Demonstrations with focused observation** — Teacher demonstrations can be highly effective when students are directed to observe specific phenomena and relate these to concepts. The teacher controls the practical variables while students focus their attention on learning.

**Micro-scale practicals** — Small-scale chemistry practicals reduce safety concerns and preparation time while maintaining the essential observational and interpretive demands of the activity.

**Predict-Observe-Explain (POE) sequences** — This structured approach requires students to predict what will happen, observe what actually happens, and explain any discrepancies. The prediction phase ensures cognitive engagement before the practical, while the explanation phase forces connection-making.

**Investigations with clear conceptual anchors** — Open-ended investigations are most effective when students have a secure conceptual foundation to draw upon and when the investigation has clear parameters and purpose.

## Common Pitfalls in Practical Work

### The "Recipe Following" Trap

The most pervasive problem in practical science teaching is what Abrahams and Millar term "recipe following" — practical activities where students follow step-by-step instructions without engaging cognitively with the underlying science. While recipe-following has its place (particularly for developing specific techniques), it becomes problematic when it dominates the curriculum.

Students in recipe-following mode may:
- Successfully complete the practical procedure while understanding little of the science
- Focus on getting the "right result" rather than understanding the phenomenon
- Fail to connect the practical to broader conceptual learning
- Develop a conception of science as procedure-following rather than evidence-based reasoning

As Millar notes, following instructions without thinking about what you are doing or why is unlikely to lead to meaningful learning.

### The Activity Without Purpose

A second common pitfall is practical work conducted without clear learning objectives. Teachers may select activities because they are engaging, traditional, or readily available without considering:
- What specific understanding students will develop
- How the practical connects to the sequence of learning
- Whether the time invested is proportionate to the learning gained

The Ofsted report (2023) identified that in some schools, "the focus was simply on identifying practical activities for pupils to complete" rather than considering how practical work develops understanding.

### The Assessment of Practical Skills

Recent changes to GCSE science assessment have separated practical skill assessment from written examinations. While this has reduced some pressures, it has created new challenges:

- Students may see practical work as disconnected from the assessed content
- The focus on technique development may overshadow conceptual learning
- Required practicals may be taught in isolation from their conceptual contexts

Research by the Wellcome Trust (2017) found that many teachers felt the current assessment arrangements did not adequately capture students' practical science capabilities.

### Inadequate Preparation and Follow-Up

Effective practical work requires careful attention to what happens before and after the activity:

**Before:** Students need activating prior knowledge, clear explanations of purpose, and appropriate predictions or hypotheses.

**After:** Students need structured opportunities to process observations, connect to concepts, and consolidate understanding.

Lessons that move too quickly from practical activity to new content miss the crucial sense-making phase where learning is consolidated.

### The Equity Problem

Practical work presents particular challenges for equitable access:

- Students with visual impairments may struggle with observation-based practicals
- Students with physical disabilities may find manipulation of equipment difficult
- Students with processing difficulties may be overwhelmed by the multi-channel demands of practical work (reading instructions, manipulating equipment, observing, recording)
- Students with English as an additional language may struggle with specialised vocabulary and instructions

Effective practical teaching requires adaptations that ensure all students can access the learning, not just those who find manipulation straightforward.

## Implications for Curriculum Planning

### Sequencing Practical Work

The science curriculum should be planned with practical work as an integral component, not an add-on. This means:

**Mapping practicals to conceptual sequences** — Each practical should be located within a clear learning progression, with connections to prior and future learning explicit.

**Balancing types of practical work** — The curriculum should include a mix of illustrative, procedural, and investigative practicals, with the balance shifting as students develop expertise.

**Building practical skills progressively** — Skills such as measurement, observation, and data handling should be developed systematically across key stages, with increasing sophistication.

### The Primary-Secondary Transition

The Ofsted report (2023) noted significant differences in the quantity and nature of practical work between primary and secondary schools. Primary pupils typically experience more hands-on practical activities, while secondary science can become more abstract. Curriculum planning should ensure:

- Secondary teachers are aware of the practical experiences pupils have had in primary
- Practical work in KS3 builds on and extends primary experiences
- The reduction in practical work frequency in secondary is justified by learning gains from other approaches

### Practical Work in Examination Specifications

GCSE and A-level specifications include required practicals that students must complete. Effective curriculum planning treats these as opportunities for learning, not just compliance exercises. This requires:

- Locating required practicals within broader conceptual sequences
- Ensuring students understand the purpose of each required practical
- Using required practicals as contexts for developing disciplinary knowledge
- Avoiding teaching required practicals in isolated "practical weeks"

## Strategies for Improving Practical Work

### The POE Approach

The Predict-Observe-Explain framework provides a structured approach to practical work that ensures cognitive engagement:

**Predict** — Students make predictions about what will happen, with reasons. This activates prior knowledge and creates a context for observation.

**Observe** — Students conduct the practical, recording observations carefully. The prediction creates a purpose for observation.

**Explain** — Students explain any discrepancies between predictions and observations, connecting practical experiences to conceptual understanding.

### Focused Observation Techniques

Teachers can improve practical work by structuring observation:

- Provide focused observation prompts rather than open-ended "record what you see" instructions
- Use demonstration to direct attention to key features before students conduct their own practicals
- Employ techniques such as "demonstration with pause points" where the teacher stops at crucial moments to direct observation

### The Role of Teacher Demonstration

Teacher demonstrations can be more effective than student practicals when:
- The phenomenon is difficult to observe at small scale
- Safety concerns make student practicals problematic
- The conceptual point is subtle and requires expert guidance to perceive
- Time is limited and the practical procedure is not itself a learning objective

The Ofsted report (2023) noted that teachers rarely used demonstrations, suggesting this is an underutilised approach.

### Using Technology to Support Practical Work

Digital technologies can enhance practical work by:
- Enabling data collection and analysis that would be impractical manually
- Slowing down or speeding up phenomena for observation
- Providing immediate feedback on measurements
- Enabling sharing and comparison of data across groups

However, technology should support rather than replace the thinking that practical work is designed to develop.

## Research Evidence and Debates

### The Evidence Base

The research evidence on practical work effectiveness is nuanced. While some studies have questioned whether practical work contributes to conceptual understanding, the more consistent finding is that practical work *can* be effective when appropriately designed and implemented.

Meta-analyses suggest that practical work has small to medium positive effects on achievement when it is:
- Integrated with conceptual instruction rather than replacing it
- Structured to require active cognitive engagement
- Supported by teacher talk that makes connections explicit

### Ongoing Debates

Several debates continue within the science education research community:

**The primacy of practical work** — Some researchers argue that practical work has been overemphasised in the science curriculum, consuming time that might be better spent on other approaches. Others maintain that practical work is essential to the nature of science and to developing scientific literacy.

**Assessment of practical skills** — There is ongoing debate about how best to assess practical capabilities, with concerns that current written examinations do not adequately capture what students can do in practical contexts.

**The role of virtual practicals** — Simulations and virtual laboratories offer potential advantages in safety, cost, and accessibility. The debate centres on what aspects of practical work can be effectively simulated and what require physical manipulation.

## Conclusion

Practical work remains central to science education, but its effectiveness cannot be assumed. Robin Millar's analytical framework provides a powerful tool for evaluating and improving practical work, focusing attention on the alignment between learning demand and support for thinking.

The key messages for teachers and curriculum leaders are:

1. **Be clear about purpose** — Every practical activity should have a clearly defined learning objective that is explicit to students.

2. **Attend to the "minds-on"** — Ensure practical work requires cognitive engagement, not just physical manipulation.

3. **Structure for sense-making** — Provide adequate time and support for students to connect practical observations to conceptual understanding.

4. **Evaluate effectiveness** — Regularly review whether practical activities are achieving their intended learning outcomes.

5. **Balance approaches** — Practical work is one tool among many; use it where it adds value and complement it with other approaches where they are more effective.

When practical work is purposeful, well-structured, and supported by skilled teaching, it provides unique opportunities for students to experience science as a living, investigative discipline. When it becomes mere recipe-following or activity for activity's sake, it wastes valuable curriculum time and may reinforce misconceptions about the nature of science.

The goal is practical work that is truly "hands-on and minds-on" — engaging students physically and cognitively in the processes of scientific enquiry.
