# Hands-on Practicals in Secondary Science

## Introduction

Practical work has long been considered the essence of science education, offering pupils authentic experiences of scientific enquiry that cannot be replicated through textbooks or digital simulations alone. Yet a persistent and troubling pattern has emerged in English schools: pupils in primary settings participate in hands-on practical activities considerably more frequently than their secondary counterparts. This decline in practical engagement represents more than a logistical challenge—it signals a fundamental shift in how science is experienced by adolescents at the very moment when many are making decisions about future study and career pathways.

Ofsted's 2023 science subject report, *Finding the Optimum*, identified that pupils in primary schools were "much more likely to take part in hands-on practical activities than those in secondary" (Ofsted, 2023). This finding aligns with data from the Education and Skills Funding Agency, which revealed a stark decline in practical frequency: in 2016, 44% of GCSE students engaged in hands-on practical work at least once a fortnight; by 2023, this had collapsed to just 26% (Education and Skills Funding Agency, 2023). The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this decline, but evidence suggests the trend predates lockdown restrictions and reflects systemic structural challenges within secondary education.

Understanding why secondary science features less practical work than primary, identifying the barriers that constrain hands-on engagement, and recognising the transformative potential of well-designed practical experiences—particularly the required practicals embedded within GCSE specifications—are essential responsibilities for science teachers and curriculum leaders. This knowledge file examines these interrelated issues through the lens of national policy, inspection evidence, and professional body research, offering practical strategies for reclaiming practical work as a central pillar of secondary science education.


## Why Secondary Science Features Less Practical Work Than Primary

The disparity in practical work frequency between primary and secondary phases is neither accidental nor simply attributable to resource constraints. Rather, it emerges from a complex interplay of curriculum structures, assessment pressures, organisational challenges, and differing pedagogical cultures across key stages.

### The Primary Practical Advantage

Primary science benefits from several structural characteristics that naturally support frequent practical engagement. The class teacher model, wherein one practitioner remains with their pupils for the majority of the school day, creates flexibility for spontaneous practical investigations when curiosity arises or when weather conditions favour outdoor observation. The integrated nature of primary timetabling allows science practicals to extend beyond rigid lesson boundaries, with investigations continuing across afternoons or spanning multiple days without the artificial constraints of period bells.

The SCORE report *Practical Work in Science* (2012) noted that primary teachers conceived of practical science fundamentally differently from their secondary colleagues. While 85% of primary teachers associated practical work with children handling materials directly, secondary teachers frequently characterised demonstrations and teacher-led practicals as valid practical experiences. This conceptual distinction matters: primary pupils' "hands on" experiences are "most emphatically the children's not the teacher's" (Institute of Physics, 2012).

Primary science also benefits from lower pupil-to-adult ratios during practical activities. With a single class teacher and often additional teaching assistants, primary pupils can be supervised more intensively during practical work than secondary pupils distributed across multiple sets and taught by specialists who may see 200+ different pupils across a week. The safety management of practical work, whilst no less rigorous, operates within more contained organisational parameters.

### The Secondary Structural Challenge

Secondary science operates under fundamentally different constraints. The specialist teacher model, whilst offering subject expertise advantages, fragments the school day into discrete lessons taught by multiple practitioners. A Year 8 pupil might encounter three different science teachers for biology, chemistry, and physics topics, each with their own classroom, equipment routines, and practical preparation systems. This fragmentation makes the spontaneous practical investigation—the natural response to an unexpected result or pupil question—logistically challenging.

Ofsted's research review and subject report identified that secondary science departments frequently struggled with curriculum coherence across the key stage. Where leaders had not invested sufficient thought in sequencing substantive and disciplinary knowledge, teachers resorted to covering content rather than ensuring learning, with practical activities becoming tokenistic checklist items rather than purposeful investigations (Ofsted, 2021; Ofsted, 2023). The pressure to address perceived gaps in pupils' substantive knowledge—compounded by concerns about Year 9 TIMSS performance and GCSE preparation—pushed some departments toward didactic teaching approaches that marginalised practical work.

### Assessment and Accountability Pressures

The removal of national curriculum testing in science at Key Stage 2 in 2009 fundamentally altered the subject's status in primary schools, but this did not translate into reduced practical engagement. Conversely, the high-stakes nature of GCSE science—with its tiered entry decisions, required practical endorsements, and significant impact on Progress 8 measures—has created accountability pressures that inadvertently discourage ambitious practical programmes.

Teachers operating within high-pressure examination contexts may reasonably conclude that practical activities carry risks: equipment failure, unexpected results, or pupil error can consume lesson time that might otherwise be devoted to content coverage or examination technique. This risk calculus, whilst understandable, represents a category error that confuses efficiency with effectiveness. As the Gatsby benchmarks for careers education emphasise, authentic experiences of scientific practice—including hands-on practical work—are essential for developing the STEM skills that employers and higher education institutions value (Gatsby Charitable Foundation, 2014).

### The Curriculum Time Tension

Secondary science must accommodate a substantial body of substantive knowledge within limited curriculum time. The National Curriculum programmes of study for Key Stage 3 and the GCSE specifications that follow are densely packed with content requirements. When teachers perceive tension between covering all topics and including practical investigations, the practical work is frequently the casualty.

Ofsted's subject report identified a significant concern: "pupils in secondary school spend too much time studying content that they have already learned in primary school" (Ofsted, 2023). This unnecessary revisiting of previously mastered material—often because secondary teachers lack confidence in primary science coverage—consumes time that could be allocated to more sophisticated practical investigations appropriate to secondary-level disciplinary knowledge.


## Barriers to Secondary Practical Work

Understanding why practical work declines in secondary settings requires detailed examination of the specific barriers that constrain teachers and departments. These barriers operate at multiple levels: systemic and policy-level challenges; school-level resource and organisational constraints; and classroom-level pedagogical and behavioural factors.

### Systemic and Policy Barriers

#### Equipment and Funding Shortfalls

The SCORE coalition—comprising the Association for Science Education, Institute of Physics, Royal Society, Royal Society of Chemistry, and Society of Biology—documented "well-documented evidence about the shortcomings of equipment funding, particularly in secondary schools" (Institute of Physics, 2012). Unlike primary science, which can often utilise everyday materials and simple apparatus, secondary science requires specialised equipment: bench power supplies, chemical reagents, microscopy facilities, and increasingly, data-logging technology.

The Royal Society of Chemistry's 2025 Science Teaching Survey reported that "the technician workforce is at risk," highlighting that technicians at all levels face challenges that impact practical provision (Royal Society of Chemistry, 2025). When equipment breaks or consumables deplete, lessons without practical alternatives may proceed rather than waiting for replacement resources. Over time, these ad-hoc substitutions accumulate into systematic practical deprivation.

#### Assessment Architecture Limitations

The current GCSE science assessment model includes required practical activities that pupils must complete, but examination questions about these practicals are typically answered in written examinations rather than through direct practical assessment. This creates what some teachers term the "practical paradox": pupils can achieve high grades without demonstrating practical competence, provided they can describe procedures and analyse data in writing.

The Wellcome Trust's 2016 report on practical science noted that when practical work is not directly assessed, it becomes vulnerable to marginalisation during high-pressure examination preparation periods. The required practical endorsement at A level, whilst an improvement, does not extend to GCSE, leaving secondary practical work vulnerable to displacement by focused revision activities.

#### Curriculum Specification Pressures

Examination specifications for GCSE science, whilst including required practicals, are densely packed with content knowledge requirements. The AQA GCSE Biology specification alone contains approximately 70 distinct topics across four broad themes. Teachers experiencing time pressure may opt for teacher demonstrations rather than pupil practicals, or substitute video presentations of practical procedures to accelerate coverage.

Ofsted's research review noted that "too often, the focus was simply on identifying practical activities for pupils to complete" rather than planning how pupils would develop disciplinary knowledge progressively (Ofsted, 2021). This activity-focused approach to practical work—treating practicals as entertainments or curiosities rather than learning opportunities—contributes to their perceived dispensability when curriculum time runs short.

### School-Level Organisational Barriers

#### Technician Workforce Challenges

Science technicians perform essential functions in enabling practical work: preparing equipment, maintaining laboratories, managing chemical stores, and supporting safety compliance. Yet the technician workforce faces significant challenges including inadequate pay progression, limited career pathways, and high turnover rates.

The ASE's Science Technician SOS booklet, downloaded over 3,500 times, identified specific challenges around emotional wellbeing, job satisfaction, and career intentions affecting technician retention (Association for Science Education, 2023). When experienced technicians leave, the tacit knowledge they held—knowing which equipment works reliably, how to prepare specific reagents, which classes need additional supervision—departs with them. New technicians require time to develop this expertise, during which practical provision may be disrupted.

#### Laboratory Accommodation Constraints

Many secondary schools operate with inadequate or poorly designed science accommodation. Laboratories built for class sizes of 20 may now accommodate 32 pupils; storage space designed for limited equipment ranges struggles to accommodate modern data-logging technology alongside traditional apparatus. The Keeping Science Practical programme identifies suitable laboratory facilities as foundational to practical work provision (Association for Science Education, 2025).

Schools operating split-site arrangements or using non-specialist spaces for science teaching face compounded challenges. Transporting practical equipment between rooms increases setup time, risk of breakage, and teacher reluctance to undertake practical work. Similarly, timetable constraints that allocate science lessons in general classrooms rather than laboratories effectively preclude practical activities regardless of teacher enthusiasm.

#### Behaviour Management Concerns

Practical work involves pupils handling potentially hazardous materials and equipment in configurations that differ from standard classroom layouts. Teachers lacking confidence in their behaviour management capabilities may avoid practical work, perceiving the risks of pupil misconduct during practicals as unmanageable.

The ASE's guidance on barriers to practical work identifies behavioural concerns as significant for some practitioners, particularly those early in their careers or new to a school with challenging pupil populations (Association for Science Education, 2025). Without robust behaviour systems and laboratory-specific routines, the cognitive load of managing practical safety alongside learning objectives can become overwhelming.

### Classroom-Level Pedagogical Barriers

#### Teacher Confidence and Expertise

Not all secondary science teachers enter the profession with equivalent practical expertise. Physics specialists may feel less confident conducting complex chemistry practicals; biologists may avoid electrical circuit investigations. The SCORE report found that teacher confidence in using specific equipment varied considerably, with some practitioners defaulting to simulations or descriptions rather than hands-on activities when uncertainty arose.

Initial teacher education has faced criticism for inadequate practical preparation. The Wellcome Trust noted that trainee teachers often observed practical work during placements but had limited opportunities to lead practicals independently. Post-qualification, professional development focused on practical work remains patchy, with teachers in isolated departments lacking colleagues to model effective practical pedagogy.

#### Curriculum Time Trade-Offs

The immediate pressures of examination preparation create powerful incentives to reduce practical work in favour of focused revision or content delivery. When teachers perceive that pupils have knowledge gaps requiring urgent address, practical activities—particularly those requiring double lesson slots or extensive setup—may be cancelled or abbreviated.

This short-term optimisation represents a false economy. Pupils who experience science primarily through textbook descriptions and examination questions develop limited understanding of scientific enquiry as a living practice. The motivational benefits of practical work—engaging pupils' curiosity, demonstrating the relevance of abstract concepts, providing memorable experiences that anchor learning—are sacrificed for incremental gains in examination performance that may prove unsustainable.

#### Misconceptions About Practical Effectiveness

Some teachers harbour misconceptions about practical work's effectiveness for learning, believing that pupils learn less effectively through practical activities than through direct instruction. Research evidence does not support this view when practical work is well-designed and properly integrated with explicit teaching of substantive and disciplinary knowledge.

Ofsted's research review emphasised that practical work is most effective when "it is planned and taught as part of a carefully sequenced curriculum" rather than as isolated activities (Ofsted, 2021). Teachers who have experienced poorly planned practicals—where pupils followed recipes without understanding, generating data without analysis—may reasonably conclude that practical work is ineffective. The appropriate response is improved practical pedagogy, not practical elimination.


## Required Practicals: Purpose and Pedagogical Value

The current GCSE science specifications require pupils to complete specified practical activities during their course. These required practicals represent a significant policy intervention designed to protect practical work from total marginalisation. Understanding their intended purpose and realising their full pedagogical potential are essential for secondary science departments seeking to maintain vibrant practical programmes.

### The Policy Rationale for Required Practicals

#### Securing Practical Experience Entitlement

Prior to the introduction of required practicals, practical science provision varied enormously between schools. Some pupils experienced rich practical programmes; others encountered science almost entirely through textbooks and demonstrations. The required practical mechanism establishes a minimum entitlement: every pupil completing GCSE science must have opportunities to handle equipment, conduct measurements, observe phenomena, and analyse experimental data.

The Department for Education's guidance emphasises that required practicals "are not optional extras" but integral components of the science curriculum (Department for Education, 2016). Examination boards monitor completion through teacher declarations, creating accountability for practical provision that previously did not exist.

#### Developing Scientific Skills and Competencies

Beyond substantive knowledge acquisition, required practicals serve explicit skills development purposes. The AQA specification guidance states that by focusing on "the reasons for carrying out a particular practical, teachers will help their students understand the subject better, to develop the skills of a scientist and to master the manipulative skills required for further study or jobs in STEM subjects" (AQA, 2024).

These skills include:

- **Manipulative techniques**: Using microscopes, measuring cylinders, electrical meters, and other scientific equipment with precision and confidence
- **Measurement and data collection**: Selecting appropriate instruments, reading scales accurately, recording systematic observations
- **Experimental design**: Identifying variables, controlling conditions, recognising sources of error
- **Data analysis**: Processing raw measurements, calculating means and ranges, identifying patterns and anomalies
- **Scientific communication**: Describing methods clearly, presenting data in tables and graphs, drawing evidence-based conclusions

#### Supporting Examination Performance

Required practicals feature directly in GCSE science examinations. Questions testing knowledge of specific practical procedures, data analysis from experimental contexts, and evaluation of experimental designs appear on every paper. Pupils who have actually conducted the required practicals approach these questions with embodied understanding that purely theoretical preparation cannot replicate.

The frequency and weighting of required practical questions in examinations sends clear signals to teachers about their importance. A typical GCSE Combined Science trilogy paper includes 15-20% of marks explicitly connected to required practical contexts, with higher weightings in separate sciences. This assessment architecture incentivises practical engagement whilst acknowledging that practical competence need not be examined through practical tests.

### Required Practical Structure Across Examination Boards

#### AQA and Edexcel Approaches

AQA and Edexcel specify eight required practicals for each separate science (biology, chemistry, physics), yielding 24 practical activities for pupils taking separate sciences or eight practicals for Combined Science pupils covering content from all three disciplines. The practicals are specified with clear learning outcomes and assessment focuses, enabling teachers to plan purposeful activities rather than formulaic recipe-following.

Examples of required practicals include:

- **Biology**: Microscopy and drawing of plant and animal cells; investigation into the effect of pH on enzyme activity; investigation of osmosis in potato strips
- **Chemistry**: Preparation of pure dry crystals of a soluble salt; investigation of how changes in concentration affect the rates of reactions; electrolysis of solutions
- **Physics**: Investigation of the relationship between force and extension for a spring; determination of the densities of solids and liquids; investigation of the properties of waves using a ripple tank

#### OCR's Practical Activity Groups

OCR takes a slightly different approach, organising practical requirements into Practical Activity Groups (PAGs) that specify skills and competencies rather than exact procedures. Teachers select specific practical activities appropriate for their pupils from exemplar lists or design their own activities meeting the PAG criteria. This approach offers greater flexibility whilst maintaining requirements for practical engagement across specified skill domains.

The PAG structure includes groups covering: practical skills and techniques; analysis and evaluation; scientific communication; and application of scientific knowledge in practical contexts. This organisation encourages teachers to view practical work holistically rather than as a checklist of individual activities to complete.

### Maximising Required Practical Pedagogical Impact

#### Integrating with Substantive Knowledge Development

Required practicals achieve maximum impact when integrated thoughtfully with teaching of substantive concepts. Rather than treating practicals as separate activities to fit around content coverage, effective departments use practical experiences to introduce, illustrate, or consolidate conceptual understanding.

For example, the required practical investigating rates of reaction can serve multiple pedagogical purposes: introducing collision theory; developing mathematical skills through timing and graphing; consolidating understanding of chemical equations; and practising evaluation of experimental design. This integration ensures that practical time contributes simultaneously to multiple curriculum objectives, addressing time-pressure concerns that might otherwise marginalise hands-on activities.

#### Developing Disciplinary Knowledge Explicitly

Ofsted's research review emphasised that pupils need to develop disciplinary knowledge—understanding how scientific knowledge is established and refined—alongside substantive knowledge of scientific concepts. Required practicals offer explicit opportunities for this development when teachers foreground scientific thinking rather than merely following procedures.

Questions that develop disciplinary knowledge during required practicals include:
- Why are we measuring this particular variable?
- What would happen if we changed this aspect of the method?
- How confident can we be in our conclusion given the data collected?
- How does this investigation relate to how scientists actually work?

By routinely asking such questions, teachers transform required practicals from procedural exercises into authentic scientific experiences that develop pupils' understanding of scientific enquiry.

#### Extending Beyond Minimum Requirements

The required practicals establish a floor, not a ceiling, for practical provision. Departments seeking to provide excellent science education should supplement required practicals with additional investigations that respond to pupil interests, explore local contexts, or prepare for A-level study. The Keeping Science Practical programme encourages schools to view required practicals as starting points rather than endpoints for practical provision (Association for Science Education, 2025).

Extension strategies include:
- **Open investigations**: Following required practicals with pupil-designed extensions that test additional variables or explore alternative methodologies
- **Local context investigations**: Applying required practical techniques to locally relevant questions—water quality testing in nearby rivers, biodiversity surveys of school grounds, investigations of materials used in local industries
- **STEM career connections**: Linking required practicals to vocational and professional applications, fulfilling Gatsby Benchmark 4 requirements for linking curriculum learning to careers (Gatsby Charitable Foundation, 2014)
- **A-level preparation**: Using required practicals as foundations for developing the independent practical competency expected at advanced level


## Overcoming Barriers: Strategies for Departments

Addressing the decline of practical work in secondary science requires coordinated action at departmental and school levels. The barriers identified above are substantial but not insurmountable—professional bodies, inspection evidence, and practitioner networks offer guidance for reclaiming practical work as central to science education.

### Securing Resources and Infrastructure

#### Advocating for Technician Support

The ASE's Science Technician SOS materials and subsequent RISE project resources provide frameworks for supporting technician wellbeing and retention (Association for Science Education, 2023). Department leaders should:

- Ensure technicians are included in departmental planning and decision-making
- Advocate for appropriate pay progression and career development opportunities
- Provide adequate preparation time and working conditions
- Recognise and value technician expertise publicly

Schools with stable, experienced technician teams consistently deliver richer practical programmes than those experiencing high turnover. Investment in technician retention yields practical dividends across the science curriculum.

#### Equipment and Accommodation Planning

Strategic equipment planning should prioritise versatile apparatus that supports multiple required practicals and extension activities. Data-logging equipment, whilst representing significant capital investment, enables efficient practical work across numerous topics. Departments might consider:

- Collaborative purchasing with local schools to secure volume discounts
- Applications to Trust budgets or external grant programmes for capital equipment
- Phased replacement programmes that prioritise most-used items
- Shared preparation systems that maximise technician efficiency

Accommodation constraints require creative solutions in many schools. Timetabling that consolidates science lessons in laboratory spaces, rather than dispersing them across general classrooms, is essential. Where split-site working or non-laboratory teaching is unavoidable, portable practical kits and carefully planned resource movement can partially compensate.

### Developing Teacher Confidence and Expertise

#### Professional Development Focus

Initial teacher education and early career development should prioritise practical competence. The Early Career Framework requirements for science teachers include explicit focus on working scientifically, providing a platform for practical skill development. Department leaders should:

- Audit staff confidence across different practical areas
- Pair less confident practitioners with experienced colleagues for team-teaching
- Schedule departmental professional development sessions focused on specific practicals
- Maintain video libraries of effective practical demonstrations and pupil investigations

The ASE's regional networks and annual conference offer practical workshops that develop teacher expertise. Online communities and resource repositories provide ongoing support for practitioners seeking to expand their practical repertoire.

#### Building Practical Pedagogical Knowledge

Effective practical teaching requires pedagogical knowledge distinct from subject knowledge alone. Teachers need to understand common pupil misconceptions related to specific practicals, anticipate likely experimental errors, and prepare scaffolding that enables successful outcomes without removing cognitive challenge.

Departmental planning should include explicit discussion of pedagogical approaches to required practicals. How will pupils be grouped? What safety briefing is necessary? How will the teacher model key techniques? What questions will develop disciplinary thinking? This planning transforms practical activities from procedural exercises into powerful learning opportunities.

### Curriculum and Assessment Design

#### Integrating Practicals with Curriculum Sequences

Rather than treating practicals as separate events to be scheduled around content coverage, effective departments integrate practical experiences into coherent curriculum sequences. The required practical investigating photosynthesis, for example, might be positioned within a sequence that:

1. Introduces the reactants and products of photosynthesis through direct instruction
2. Models the required practical technique through teacher demonstration
3. Supports pupils in conducting the investigation with appropriate scaffolding
4. Uses the data generated to develop mathematical skills in handling variability
5. Applies understanding to novel contexts such as commercial horticulture

This integration ensures that practical time serves multiple learning objectives simultaneously, addressing time-pressure concerns that might otherwise marginalise hands-on activities.

#### Assessment That Values Practical Work

Formative assessment during practical activities should focus on the development of disciplinary knowledge, not merely procedural compliance. Teachers might assess:

- Quality of predictions and hypotheses
- Appropriateness of method design or modification
- Accuracy and precision of measurements
- Clarity of data presentation
- Validity of conclusions drawn from evidence

Summative assessment can include practical-focused questions that reward genuine practical experience. When pupils who have conducted investigations perform significantly better on such questions than those relying on theoretical preparation alone, the value of practical work becomes evident to pupils, parents, and school leadership.

### Behaviour Management and Safety

#### Establishing Laboratory Routines

Effective practical work depends on established routines that minimise disruption and maximise safety. Department-wide consistency in laboratory expectations—how pupils enter, how equipment is distributed and collected, how safety briefings are conducted—reduces the cognitive load of behaviour management during practicals.

New classes should experience intensive routine establishment before undertaking complex practicals. Early practical experiences in the academic year might focus on simple, safe procedures that establish behavioural expectations rather than ambitious investigations. Once routines are internalised, cognitive capacity becomes available for learning through practical work.

#### Risk Assessment and Confidence

Comprehensive risk assessments, regularly reviewed and updated, provide the foundation for confident practical teaching. Teachers who understand the hazards associated with specific practicals and the control measures that mitigate them can focus on pedagogy rather than anxiety.

The CLEAPSS and SSERC advisory services provide model risk assessments for common school science practicals. Departmental use of these services ensures that safety documentation meets professional standards without requiring teachers to generate assessments from scratch.


## Conclusion

The decline of hands-on practical work in secondary science represents a significant challenge for the profession—a challenge with implications for pupil motivation, learning outcomes, and the future pipeline of scientists, engineers, and scientifically literate citizens. Understanding why secondary science features less practical work than primary phases, identifying the barriers that constrain practical provision, and recognising the transformative potential of well-designed required practicals are essential steps toward reversing this troubling trend.

The evidence is clear: pupils in primary schools currently experience more frequent hands-on practical engagement than their secondary counterparts. This disparity emerges not from resource limitations alone but from structural characteristics of secondary schooling, assessment pressures, organisational challenges, and pedagogical misconceptions that accumulate to marginalise practical work.

Yet the required practicals embedded within GCSE specifications offer a policy foundation for reclaiming practical work as central to science education. These mandated activities establish a minimum entitlement to practical experience and provide examination incentives that support practical engagement. When taught with attention to disciplinary knowledge development, integration with substantive concepts, and extension beyond minimum requirements, required practicals become vehicles for transformative science learning.

Overcoming barriers to practical work demands coordinated action: securing technician support and equipment resources; developing teacher confidence and expertise; designing curricula that integrate practical experiences; and establishing routines that enable safe, efficient practical management. The professional bodies—ASE, IOP, RSC, Royal Society—offer guidance and resources for departments undertaking this work.

The Gatsby benchmarks remind us that linking curriculum learning to careers requires authentic experiences of scientific practice. Required practicals, extended and enriched through departmental planning, provide precisely these experiences. As pupils handle equipment, grapple with unexpected results, and develop confidence in scientific techniques, they encounter science not as abstract content to be memorised but as a living practice of enquiry and discovery.

For science departments committed to excellence, the path forward is clear: treat required practicals as foundations rather than ceilings, invest in the resources and expertise that enable ambitious practical programmes, and continuously advocate for the centrality of hands-on investigation to science education. The pupils in our care deserve nothing less than authentic experiences of science as a practical, investigative discipline—and the future of scientific literacy in our society depends upon our success in providing them.
