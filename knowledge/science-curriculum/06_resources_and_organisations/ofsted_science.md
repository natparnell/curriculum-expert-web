## Overview

Ofsted, the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills, plays a central role in shaping science education in England through its inspection framework, research reviews, and subject reports. Since the introduction of the Education Inspection Framework (EIF) in September 2019, Ofsted has placed curriculum quality at the heart of school evaluation, with science frequently selected for "deep dive" scrutiny during inspections. This knowledge base entry synthesises Ofsted's key publications and guidance relating to science education, providing subject leaders and teachers with a comprehensive understanding of inspection expectations, research-informed practice, and the characteristics of high-quality science provision.

## The Ofsted Research Review Series: Science (2021)

### Purpose and Context

In April 2021, Ofsted published its Science Research Review as the inaugural publication in a series of subject-specific research reviews. The review's purpose was to identify factors that contribute to high-quality school science curriculums, assessment, pedagogy, and systems. It draws upon extensive academic literature and empirical research to establish an evidence-informed conception of subject quality that informs Ofsted's inspection methodology.

The research review emphasises that science education matters because scientific knowledge fundamentally shapes every aspect of our world. Science drives innovation, creates new knowledge to help solve current and future problems, and all young people are entitled to a high-quality science education that engenders curiosity and brings understanding and opportunity.

### Key Concepts: Substantive and Disciplinary Knowledge

A defining contribution of the 2021 Research Review is its clear articulation of two distinct but interrelated forms of knowledge in science education:

#### Substantive Knowledge

Substantive knowledge refers to the established knowledge produced by science—the products of scientific endeavour. This includes:

- Scientific concepts and theories (e.g., evolution, atomic structure, photosynthesis)
- Facts and terminology (e.g., the names of planets, parts of a flower, chemical symbols)
- Models and laws (e.g., Newton's laws of motion, the particle model of matter)

In the national curriculum, this is referred to as "scientific knowledge" and "conceptual understanding." The research review emphasises that substantive knowledge is not merely a collection of isolated facts but a connected body of understanding that pupils build progressively over time.

#### Disciplinary Knowledge

Disciplinary knowledge refers to what pupils learn about how scientific knowledge is established, refined, and validated. This encompasses:

- Scientific methods and enquiry processes
- How to carry out practical procedures systematically
- Understanding of concepts such as validity, reliability, and fair testing
- Knowledge of how scientific consensus emerges through peer review and replication

The research review stresses that disciplinary knowledge should not be reduced to generic "scientific skills" but should be understood as a body of knowledge in its own right—knowledge of the practices, conventions, and epistemological foundations of science.

### Curriculum Architecture

The research review identifies several characteristics of effective science curriculums:

**Connected Knowledge**: High-quality curriculums map out the detail of knowledge—both substantive and disciplinary—that children should learn and the ways in which this knowledge is connected. Concepts are sequenced so that pupils build progressively, with new learning explicitly linked to prior knowledge.

**Progression in Disciplinary Knowledge**: The review notes that while many curriculums articulate progression in substantive knowledge, far fewer give equivalent attention to disciplinary knowledge. Effective curriculums identify the specific disciplinary concepts pupils need to learn and revisit these systematically across key stages.

**Integration of Mathematics**: Science relies heavily upon mathematical knowledge—from data handling and graphing to algebraic relationships and proportional reasoning. The research review highlights the importance of curriculums that take account of what pupils learn in mathematics and make explicit connections between the two subjects.

**Addressing Misconceptions**: Pupils enter science classrooms with pre-existing ideas about natural phenomena, many of which are scientifically inaccurate. High-quality curriculums anticipate common misconceptions and plan teaching that directly addresses and challenges these alternative conceptions.

## The Science Subject Report: Finding the Optimum (2023)

### Methodology and Scope

Published in February 2023, "Finding the Optimum: The Science Subject Report" represents Ofsted's most significant evaluation of science education practice since the EIF's introduction. The report synthesises evidence gathered during routine inspections across primary and secondary schools, including Reception classes and sixth forms. It builds directly upon the 2021 Research Review, using the framework of substantive and disciplinary knowledge to evaluate what inspectors observed in schools.

The report is careful to note that its findings will not be used as a "tick list" during inspections. Ofsted recognises that there are many different ways schools can construct and teach high-quality science curriculums, and the report aims to share learning rather than prescribe specific approaches.

### Context and Challenges

The subject report situates its findings within several contextual challenges facing science education:

**TIMSS Performance Concerns**: Data from the 2019 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) showed concerning trends. While Year 5 pupils performed relatively well, England recorded its lowest Year 9 science score, with the proportion of pupils performing below the lowest TIMSS measure having doubled since 2015.

**Status of Science in Primary Schools**: The removal of national tests in science in 2009 coincided with a relative decline in the performance of 10-year-old pupils. Ofsted expresses concern that the status of science in some primary schools has remained lower since this change, affecting pupils' preparation for key stage 3.

**COVID-19 Impact**: Science was particularly affected by pandemic restrictions, which deprived many pupils of practical learning opportunities. Additionally, many trainee teachers were unable to teach full science curriculums during this period, potentially affecting the preparation of the teaching workforce.

**Teacher Recruitment**: The recruitment of sufficient specialist science teachers in secondary schools remains an ongoing challenge, particularly in physics.

### Key Findings: Primary Schools

#### Curriculum Strengths

The report identifies that most primary pupils, including those with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), study a science curriculum at least as ambitious as the national curriculum. These curriculums are generally focused on developing pupils' knowledge of substantive concepts such as "habitat," "force," and "material" over time.

Where science was strong, pupils had learned detailed and connected knowledge and remembered what they had learned previously. Teachers generally had secure subject knowledge, and clear explanations—alongside carefully selected teaching activities—supported the learning of specific content.

#### Areas for Development

**Disciplinary Knowledge**: Leaders' plans to develop pupils' disciplinary knowledge were typically much less developed than their plans for substantive knowledge. Not enough consideration was given to identifying the disciplinary knowledge, including concepts, that pupils need to work scientifically. Too often, the focus was simply on identifying practical activities to complete, rather than planning how pupils would get better at working scientifically over time.

**Assessment**: Assessment in primary science often did not check whether pupils had remembered what they learned in previous years. Generalised judgements against age-related expectations sometimes lacked clarity about what these grades represented in relation to specific curriculum content.

**Curriculum Time**: A small minority of primary schools were identified where pupils went for entire half terms without learning science. This is particularly concerning because science is a core subject of the national curriculum, and pupils benefit from regular opportunities to revisit and build knowledge.

**Reception Provision**: While children in Reception were generally introduced to interesting phenomena, the knowledge of the natural world they were expected to learn was sometimes not clear enough. Curriculums that identified only general topic areas or activities limited how effectively children were prepared for Year 1 science.

**Learning Gaps**: Some pupils emerged from lockdown with significant gaps in scientific knowledge. In some schools, there was an over-reliance on pupils catching up when content was repeated later, rather than ensuring it was learned first time.

### Key Findings: Secondary Schools

#### Curriculum Coverage

In secondary schools, the focus was generally on covering substantive content, with less attention to the development of disciplinary knowledge. In a significant minority of schools, pupils were not developing secure knowledge because the focus was on covering content rather than ensuring it was learned.

#### Practical Work

The report found large differences in the amount of practical work taking place. Pupils in primary schools were much more likely to take part in hands-on practical activities than those in secondary school. Across all schools visited, teachers rarely used demonstrations, which can be an effective way of showing phenomena that might be difficult for pupils to observe directly.

#### Pacing and Consolidation

Some secondary pupils did not have sufficient opportunities to practise and consolidate learning before moving on to new content. This was often linked to teachers being expected to teach too much content in too short a time, leading to insufficient retention of key concepts.

#### Transition from Primary

In some secondary schools, it was incorrectly assumed that pupils learned little science in primary school, leading to unnecessary repetition of content in Year 7. Where transition was handled well, secondary leaders built on what pupils had learned previously rather than starting from scratch.

#### Continuing Professional Development

Very few schools had clear plans for how teachers' knowledge of science and how to teach it was developed over time through CPD. During the pandemic, many teachers missed subject-specific CPD, and not all schools had returned to their previous commitment to curriculum-aligned professional development.

### Subject Leadership

The report emphasises the crucial role of subject leaders in developing science curriculums and supporting teachers. However, not all subject leaders had access to dedicated leadership time and subject leadership training—a concern given their central role in ensuring quality teaching.

### Recommendations

The report offers several specific recommendations for school and subject leaders:

**Curriculum Sequencing**: Ensure the curriculum sequences disciplinary knowledge so pupils learn and practise skills across all areas of working scientifically. Identify and sequence the disciplinary knowledge pupils need to work scientifically with the same rigour as substantive content.

**Reception Detail**: Ensure content taught in Reception is detailed as explicitly as for Key Stages 1 and 2. Make clear connections between Reception content and what pupils learn in Year 1.

**Connected Knowledge**: Explicitly teach how new content links to pre-existing knowledge so pupils build connected understanding. Use the curriculum as a "path" that makes learning science easier, not merely a description of what to cover.

**Assessment**: Check whether pupils have remembered what they learned in previous years, not just current topics. Ensure assessment covers disciplinary knowledge, not just substantive knowledge.

**Mathematics Links**: Plan the science curriculum to take account of what pupils learn in mathematics, making explicit connections between the subjects.

**CPD**: Develop clear plans for subject-specific CPD that is closely aligned to the curriculum, ensuring teachers develop their knowledge of both science content and science pedagogy over time.

**Practical Work**: Ensure practical activities are purposeful and linked to clear learning objectives about both substantive and disciplinary knowledge, rather than completing activities for their own sake.

## Deep Dive Inspections: Intent, Implementation, and Impact

### The Deep Dive Methodology

Under the EIF, inspectors conduct "deep dives" into specific subjects to evaluate the quality of education. A deep dive involves gathering rich evidence on curriculum intent, implementation, and impact through:

- Conversations with subject leaders about curriculum design and sequencing
- Lesson observations and learning walks
- Scrutiny of pupils' work
- Discussion with pupils about their learning
- Review of curriculum documentation

Science is frequently selected for deep dive inspection due to its status as a core national curriculum subject and the importance of practical work in the discipline.

### Intent: What Do You Want Pupils to Learn?

Curriculum intent refers to the thinking behind the curriculum—what leaders intend pupils to know and be able to do, and why these choices have been made. For science, inspectors will explore:

**Scope and Ambition**: Does the curriculum cover the national curriculum programmes of study? Is it at least as ambitious? Does it go beyond minimum expectations where appropriate?

**Sequencing**: How is knowledge organised and sequenced? Does the order in which topics are taught support pupils to build progressively, making connections between related concepts?

**Substantive Knowledge**: What specific scientific concepts, facts, and theories will pupils learn? How does the curriculum ensure progression in conceptual understanding from EYFS through to the end of Key Stage 2 (and beyond in secondary)?

**Disciplinary Knowledge**: What do pupils learn about how science works? How is working scientifically integrated with substantive content rather than taught as isolated skills?

**Literacy and Oracy**: How does the curriculum develop pupils' ability to use scientific vocabulary, explain scientific concepts, and engage with scientific argumentation?

**Inclusion**: How does the curriculum ensure all pupils, including those with SEND, can access and achieve in science?

### Implementation: How Is the Curriculum Taught?

Implementation concerns how the intended curriculum is put into practice in classrooms. Inspectors will look for:

**Pedagogical Subject Knowledge**: Do teachers have secure knowledge of the science they are teaching? Can they explain concepts clearly, anticipate misconceptions, and make connections to prior and future learning?

**Lesson Design**: Are lessons designed to help pupils learn specific content? Is there a logical structure that builds understanding progressively within and across lessons?

**Practical Work**: Are practical activities purposeful and linked to clear learning objectives? Do pupils understand why they are doing practical work and what they are intended to learn from it? Is disciplinary knowledge taught through practical activities, not just substantive content?

**Scaffolding and Adaptation**: How do teachers adapt teaching to meet the needs of different learners without lowering expectations?

**Assessment for Learning**: Do teachers use questioning and other strategies to check understanding during lessons and adapt teaching accordingly?

**Resources**: Are resources (equipment, texts, digital tools) well-chosen to support the intended learning?

### Impact: What Do Pupils Know and Remember?

Impact concerns the extent to which pupils have learned what was intended and can use and apply that knowledge. Inspectors will explore:

**Pupil Knowledge**: What do pupils know and remember of the curriculum they have been taught? Can they recall and use scientific vocabulary accurately?

**Understanding**: Can pupils explain scientific concepts in their own words? Do they understand the relationships between different areas of science?

**Working Scientifically**: Can pupils carry out scientific enquiries appropriately? Do they understand concepts such as fair testing, variables, and validity?

**Progress Over Time**: Is there evidence of progress in pupils' books and in their ability to talk about their learning? Can they make connections to prior learning?

**Attainment**: How do pupils' attainment and progress compare to national expectations? What is the trend over time?

### Common Deep Dive Questions for Science Subject Leaders

Subject leaders should be prepared to discuss:

- What is the rationale behind your curriculum sequence? Why is science taught in this order?
- How does your curriculum build pupils' substantive knowledge progressively from Reception to Year 6?
- What specific disciplinary knowledge do pupils learn, and how is this sequenced?
- How do you ensure pupils remember what they have learned? What retrieval strategies do you use?
- How is working scientifically integrated with your substantive curriculum rather than taught separately?
- What are the common misconceptions in your science topics, and how does the curriculum address them?
- How do you support pupils with SEND to access the science curriculum?
- How do you ensure teachers have sufficient subject knowledge to teach science effectively?
- What CPD have you provided for science teaching, and how is this linked to curriculum priorities?
- How do you assess science? Does your assessment check learning over time or just current topics?
- How do you use assessment information to improve the curriculum and teaching?
- How does your curriculum prepare pupils for the next stage of education?
- How do you ensure practical work is purposeful and leads to learning?
- What science resources do you have, and how do you ensure they are used effectively?

## Ofsted's View on Common Practices

### What Ofsted Values

**Curriculum as a Path**: Ofsted emphasises that high-quality science curriculums are not merely descriptions of content to cover but carefully designed paths that make learning easier. This includes anticipating misconceptions, making connections to prior learning, and sequencing content to build understanding progressively.

**Pupils Learning Science**: The research review and subject report consistently stress that the goal is pupils learning science, not just experiencing science activities. Whether through practical work, demonstrations, or other approaches, the focus must remain on what pupils are intended to learn.

**Connected Knowledge**: Both documents value curriculums that help pupils build connected knowledge—understanding how scientific concepts relate to each other and to pupils' prior learning.

**Disciplinary Rigor**: Ofsted expects disciplinary knowledge to be taught with the same precision and rigour as substantive concepts. Working scientifically should not be reduced to generic skills but should be understood as a body of knowledge in its own right.

### What Ofsted Cautions Against

**Activity-Focused Teaching**: The subject report identifies a risk when the focus becomes completing activities rather than ensuring learning. Practical work is valuable when purposeful but should not be done for its own sake.

**Coverage Over Learning**: Rushing through content to ensure everything is "covered" without checking that pupils have learned and remembered key concepts is identified as a weakness.

**Isolated Skills**: Teaching "working scientifically" as a separate strand, disconnected from substantive content, does not adequately develop pupils' disciplinary knowledge.

**Assessing Without Teaching**: Assessment that checks knowledge pupils have not been taught—or that has not been taught effectively—does not serve learning.

**Generic CPD**: Professional development that is not closely aligned to the specific curriculum and context of the school is less likely to improve teaching quality.

## Preparing for Science Deep Dives: Practical Guidance

### Documentation

Ofsted does not require special documentation for inspection. However, subject leaders should be able to articulate and demonstrate:

- The curriculum sequence and rationale
- How progression is planned for both substantive and disciplinary knowledge
- How assessment informs teaching and curriculum development
- What support is provided for teachers' professional development

### Evidence in the Classroom

The most powerful evidence of curriculum quality comes from what inspectors see and hear in classrooms:

- Pupils engaging with challenging scientific content
- Teachers explaining concepts clearly and accurately
- Purposeful practical work linked to clear learning objectives
- Pupils using scientific vocabulary accurately
- Evidence of progression in pupils' work over time

### Preparing Staff

All teachers, not just the subject leader, should be prepared to talk about the science curriculum. Inspectors may speak to class teachers about:

- What pupils are learning in the current unit and why
- How the unit fits into the broader curriculum sequence
- What pupils learned previously that connects to this unit
- How the lesson's activities help pupils learn specific content
