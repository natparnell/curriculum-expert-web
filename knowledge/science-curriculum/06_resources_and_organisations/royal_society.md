# The Royal Society: Education Policy, Enrichment Programmes and STEM Engagement

## Overview and Historical Context

The Royal Society is the independent scientific academy of the United Kingdom, founded in 1660 during the Restoration of King Charles II. As the world's oldest national scientific institution, it has played a central role in advancing scientific knowledge and promoting science education for over three and a half centuries. The Society's motto, *Nullius in verba* ("Take nobody's word for it"), reflects its commitment to evidence-based inquiry—a principle that underpins its educational philosophy today.

In the contemporary educational landscape, the Royal Society serves multiple functions that are vital for science teachers in UK schools. Through its policy work, the Society shapes national debates about science education, curriculum design, and the skills pipeline needed for a research-intensive economy. Through its practical programmes, it provides direct support to schools, teachers, and students, bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and classroom practice.

## Education Policy and Advocacy

### Foundational Principles

The Royal Society advocates for an education system that equips all young people with the scientific and mathematical literacy needed to thrive in the twenty-first century. Its policy work rests on several key principles that should inform curriculum planning and pedagogical decision-making in schools:

**Broad and Balanced Curriculum:** The Society consistently argues that all young people should study a broad curriculum including mathematics and science, rather than narrowing their options too early. This principle has particular relevance in the context of GCSE choices, where the Society has voiced concerns about students dropping science subjects prematurely.

**Equity and Access:** The Royal Society emphasises that scientific education should be accessible to students from all backgrounds, regardless of socioeconomic status, gender, ethnicity, or geographic location. This equity focus is reflected in programmes designed to reach underserved communities and schools with limited resources.

**Practical Skills and Investigative Science:** The Society's policy work stresses the importance of hands-on, investigative science education. This aligns with the Gatsby Practical Science Benchmarks, which the Society helped develop and continues to promote.

**Research-Intensive Economy Preparation:** The Society argues that science education must prepare students for careers in an increasingly research- and innovation-driven economy, requiring not just subject knowledge but transferable skills such as problem-solving, data analysis, and critical thinking.

### Key Policy Reports and Initiatives

The Royal Society has produced numerous influential reports that have shaped science education policy in the UK. Understanding these reports provides teachers with authoritative evidence to inform curriculum planning and professional discussions.

**The State of the Nation Series:** Beginning in 2007, the Society published a series of "state of the nation" reports examining science and mathematics education for 14–19 year olds. These reports analysed participation trends, qualification uptake, and the factors influencing student choices. The series established a methodology for tracking the UK's science education pipeline and identified persistent challenges, including the gender gap in physics and the decline of mathematics participation among certain student groups.

**The Science Education for a Research and Innovation Economy Report (2022):** This report examined how science education prepares young people for careers in research and innovation. It made recommendations about curriculum breadth, practical science provision, and the integration of contemporary research contexts into teaching. The report emphasised that preparing students for research careers requires more than subject knowledge—it demands development of scientific reasoning, ethical awareness, and collaborative working skills.

**Primary Science Education Advocacy:** The Royal Society has consistently argued that primary education represents a critical window for building enthusiasm and engagement in science. Its policy work highlights the importance of early positive experiences and the need for well-trained primary teachers with confidence in science subject knowledge. This research underpins the Society's provision of resources specifically designed for primary practitioners.

**Mathematics and Data Education:** Recognising the growing importance of data literacy, the Royal Society has published reports on mathematical and data education. These documents argue for the integration of data skills across the curriculum and highlight the workforce implications of data literacy gaps. For science teachers, this work validates the importance of teaching data handling, statistical analysis, and data interpretation as core scientific competencies.

### Curriculum and Assessment Engagement

The Royal Society actively responds to government consultations on curriculum and assessment reforms. Teachers should be aware that the Society's responses represent the collective view of the UK scientific community and often carry significant weight in policy discussions.

The Society's 2023–2024 engagement with the English curriculum and assessment review, for example, emphasised several priorities:

- Maintaining breadth and balance in science education rather than premature specialisation
- Protecting time and resources for practical, investigative science
- Ensuring qualifications assess scientific thinking and not merely factual recall
- Addressing the recruitment and retention crisis in science teaching
- Improving the transition between key stages, particularly from primary to secondary

## Partnership Grants Scheme: The Flagship Programme

### Programme Structure and Purpose

The Partnership Grants scheme represents the Royal Society's flagship programme for schools, providing funding of up to £3,000 for investigative STEM projects undertaken in partnership between schools and STEM professionals from academia or industry. Established in 1999, the scheme has invested over £1.3 million in approximately 800 schools, reaching tens of thousands of students across the UK.

The scheme addresses a critical gap in science education: the opportunity for students to engage in genuine investigative work that mirrors the practices of professional scientists. Unlike prescriptive practical activities designed to confirm known principles, Partnership Grants projects involve open-ended investigation where outcomes are genuinely unknown and students contribute to new knowledge.

### Eligibility and Application Process

The scheme is open to all schools and colleges in the UK (including the Channel Islands and Isle of Man) supporting students aged 5–18. Applications must involve a genuine partnership between:

- A school partner (the lead teacher and students)
- A STEM partner (a qualified researcher or industry professional actively working in a STEM field)

The STEM partner requirement is fundamental to the scheme's design. Partners might be university researchers, industry scientists, engineers, technologists, or mathematicians. The partner's role is not merely advisory but involves active collaboration throughout the project, including contributing expertise, supporting experimental design, and helping students understand how professional scientists work.

Applications are submitted through the Royal Society's Flexi-Grant® online system. There are typically three application rounds per year, with deadlines in April, July, and November. The Society provides free online introduction sessions throughout term time to support applicants, covering the application process, partnership development, and project design.

### Project Characteristics and Examples

Successful Partnership Grants projects share several characteristics:

**Genuine Investigation:** Projects must involve investigative approaches rather than mere demonstration. Students should be asking questions, designing investigations, collecting and analysing data, and drawing conclusions.

**STEM Partner Collaboration:** The partnership with a STEM professional should be substantive, with the partner contributing to project design, implementation, and student learning throughout.

**Student Ownership:** While teachers and STEM partners provide guidance, students should have meaningful ownership of the investigation, including input into research questions and methods.

**Practical Application:** Projects should involve practical, hands-on activity rather than purely theoretical or desk-based work.

**Local Relevance:** Many successful projects address locally relevant questions, connecting scientific investigation to students' immediate environments and communities.

Examples of funded projects include:

- Investigating biodiversity in school grounds with support from a local university ecology department
- Testing water quality in local rivers with partnership from an environmental science consultancy
- Developing sustainable energy solutions for the school with engineering industry partners
- Investigating the effects of microplastics on aquatic organisms with marine biology researchers
- Exploring genetic diversity in local plant populations with botany academics

### Tomorrow's Climate Scientists Extension

The Tomorrow's Climate Scientists extension to the Partnership Grants scheme provides dedicated funding for schools investigating climate change and biodiversity loss. This programme recognises the urgency of climate education and the powerful motivation that environmental concern provides for student engagement in science.

Projects funded through Tomorrow's Climate Scientists might include:

- Measuring carbon sequestration potential of school grounds vegetation
- Investigating local biodiversity changes over time
- Testing sustainable materials and their properties
- Analysing air quality in different local environments
- Developing school-based renewable energy solutions

The programme aims not merely to educate students about climate change but to empower them as active participants in addressing environmental challenges—to become, as the Society puts it, "the climate scientists of tomorrow."

### Alignment with Career and Science Benchmarks

Partnership Grants directly support schools in meeting the Gatsby Career Benchmarks and Gatsby Practical Science Benchmarks:

**Gatsby Career Benchmark 5 (Encounters with Employers and Employees):** STEM partner involvement provides students with direct contact with professionals in science-related roles.

**Gatsby Career Benchmark 6 (Experiences of Workplaces):** While not formal work experience, the collaborative nature of projects gives students insight into professional scientific workplaces.

**Gatsby Practical Science Benchmark 8:** The scheme explicitly supports investigative science and the development of practical skills across the secondary curriculum.

## Free Educational Resources

### Brian Cox School Experiments

The Brian Cox School Experiments represent one of the Royal Society's most widely used resource collections. Featuring Professor Brian Cox demonstrating classroom experiments, these resources aim to support teachers—particularly non-specialist STEM teachers—in embedding practical learning into their teaching.

**Series One (Primary):** The primary-level resources cover six experiments across the primary science curriculum:

- Do plants need soil to grow?
- How does exercise affect your heart rate?
- What makes the best bubble mixture?
- Which material makes the best umbrella?
- How does heat move?
- What do bees do?

Each experiment is supported by four videos: a classroom demonstration by Professor Cox, an explanation of the science, an industry application, and a research context. The multiple video structure helps students connect classroom science to real-world applications and cutting-edge research.

**Series Two (Secondary):** The secondary-level resources explore emerging technologies and contemporary scientific contexts:

- Genetic technologies and DNA analysis
- Machine learning and artificial intelligence applications
- Cybersecurity and digital safety
- Climate science and carbon capture
- Renewable energy technologies
- Materials science and nanotechnology

These resources are particularly valuable for addressing the challenge of keeping science curriculum content current. Teachers can use the research and industry videos to show students how the science they study in school connects to active research frontiers and emerging career opportunities.

### Why Science Resources

The Why Science resources comprise short animations designed to demonstrate the relevance of science to the curriculum and the diverse opportunities that studying science can lead to. These resources address a persistent challenge in science education: student perceptions that science is disconnected from their interests and future aspirations.

The animations feature diverse scientists in various roles, challenging stereotypes about who can pursue scientific careers. They are designed for use in careers guidance, options evenings, and classroom teaching to support student motivation and subject uptake.

### Young People's Book Prize

The Royal Society Young People's Book Prize is an annual award celebrating the best science books for under-14s. The prize serves dual educational purposes: promoting scientific literacy through engaging literature, and providing schools with opportunities to involve students in authentic judging processes.

Schools can apply to become judging panels, receiving free copies of the six shortlisted books. Student judges read the books, discuss them collaboratively, and vote for their favourite. This process develops critical reading, discussion, and evaluation skills while building student engagement with science content.

The shortlisted books typically cover diverse scientific topics, from biology and physics to environmental science and technology, providing rich cross-curricular opportunities. Teachers have reported that involvement in the prize significantly increases student enthusiasm for science reading and discussion.

## Science Community Grant

The Science Community Grant represents a strategic investment in building sustainable capacity for science education within school communities. Funded organisations create collaborative communities where teachers share best practices, receive peer support, and work closely with STEM professionals to enrich hands-on learning.

The programme is designed with progression in mind: schools participating in Science Community Grants are encouraged to build the capacity and partnerships needed to apply for full Partnership Grants. This creates a pathway from initial engagement through to substantial investigative projects.

The Royal Society takes an active role in these communities, participating in network events and supporting knowledge exchange between schools. This approach recognises that sustainable improvement in science education requires collaborative professional learning rather than isolated individual effort.

## Student Conferences and Events

### Summer Science Exhibition

The Royal Society's annual Summer Science Exhibition represents one of the UK's premier science engagement events. For schools, the exhibition offers several engagement opportunities:

**Young Researcher Zone:** Schools funded through Partnership Grants have opportunities to present their research in the Young Researcher Zone, engaging with peers, Fellows of the Royal Society, and members of the public. This experience provides students with authentic scientific communication practice and recognises the value of their investigative work.

**School Visits:** The Society offers bookings for schools to visit the Summer Science Exhibition, experiencing cutting-edge research through interactive exhibits and direct engagement with researchers. These visits can inspire students, demonstrate the diversity of scientific careers, and connect classroom learning to research frontiers.

### Student Conferences

The Royal Society organises student conferences specifically for Partnership Grants recipients. These events provide opportunities for students to:

- Present their research findings to authentic audiences
- Engage with researchers from diverse scientific fields
- Develop scientific communication and presentation skills
- Network with peers from other schools
- Receive recognition for their investigative achievements

For teachers, these conferences provide professional learning opportunities, enabling observation of student presentations from other schools and networking with colleagues engaged in similar work.

## STEM Ambassadors Programme

### Programme Overview

While the Royal Society coordinates its own school engagement programmes, it operates within a broader ecosystem of STEM support that includes the national STEM Ambassadors programme. Understanding this wider landscape helps teachers access the full range of available support.

The STEM Ambassadors programme, coordinated by STEM Learning, supports a network of thousands of volunteers who bring real-life examples of STEM careers into schools, colleges, and universities across the UK. STEM Ambassadors are professionals from industry and academia who volunteer their time to inspire young people into STEM subjects and careers.

### Ambassador Activities in Schools

STEM Ambassadors can support schools in numerous ways:

**Careers Talks and Events:** Ambassadors can speak about their career pathways, explain their current work, and challenge stereotypes about who works in STEM. These inputs are particularly valuable for meeting Gatsby Career Benchmark 5 (Encounters with Employers and Employees).

**Curriculum Support:** Ambassadors can contribute to specific curriculum topics, providing real-world contexts for classroom learning. A civil engineer might explain how they use mathematical modelling, or a pharmaceutical researcher might discuss drug development processes.

**Project Mentoring:** Ambassadors can mentor students undertaking project work, including Extended Project Qualifications (EPQs), CREST Awards, and Partnership Grants projects.

**Practical Support:** Ambassadors can assist with practical activities, bringing equipment, expertise, or simply additional adult support for hands-on investigations.

**Challenge and Competition Support:** Many ambassadors support STEM challenges, competitions, and enrichment activities such as robotics competitions, science fairs, and engineering challenges.

### Accessing STEM Ambassadors

Teachers can request STEM Ambassador support through the STEM Learning website (stem.org.uk). The online platform allows teachers to specify the type of support needed, desired timeframes, and curriculum areas. The programme is free to schools, with all ambassadors having undergone safeguarding checks including DBS clearance.

The Royal Society's Partnership Grants scheme and the STEM Ambassadors programme are complementary. Schools successful in obtaining Partnership Grants may identify STEM Ambassadors as potential STEM partners, while the ambassador network can provide broader careers engagement beyond specific grant-funded projects.

## The Royal Society's Role in Teacher Professional Development

While the Society does not operate a formal teacher training programme, its resources and events contribute significantly to teacher professional development:

**Subject Knowledge Updating:** Resources such as the Brian Cox School Experiments and Summer Science Exhibition provide teachers with accessible updates on scientific developments, supporting teachers in maintaining current subject knowledge.
