# SCORE (Science Community Representing Education)

## Overview

**SCORE (Science Community Representing Education)** was a powerful policy partnership of leading UK science organisations that operated from 2008 to approximately 2015. Its primary mission was to improve science education in schools and colleges in England by influencing government policy, supporting the development of effective education frameworks, and championing high-quality practical work in science.

SCORE represented an unprecedented collaboration between the UK's most prestigious scientific bodies, bringing together expertise from across the scientific community to speak with one voice on science education matters. Though the formal partnership is no longer active, its influence persists through successor organisations and the enduring impact of its publications, particularly those concerning practical science.

## Key Policy Focus Areas

### 1. Practical Work in Science

SCORE's most significant and enduring contribution was its extensive work on practical science education. The partnership recognised that practical work is central to science education—not merely as a means of illustrating concepts, but as a way of developing scientific thinking, investigative skills, and enthusiasm for the subject.

#### The Strategic Framework (2010)

In 2010, SCORE published **"Practical Work in Science: A Report and Proposal for a Strategic Framework"**, which examined the state of practical work across primary, secondary, and post-16 science education. This seminal report:

- Analysed the purposes and value of practical work in science
- Identified systemic barriers to high-quality practical science
- Proposed a strategic framework for improvement
- Called for sustained government commitment to practical science resourcing

The report argued that practical work should serve multiple purposes: developing conceptual understanding, teaching scientific enquiry skills, and fostering positive attitudes towards science.

#### The "Getting Practical" Programme

Building on the strategic framework, SCORE developed the **"Getting Practical: Improving Practical Work in Science"** programme, which included:

- **A Framework for Practical Work in Science**: A booklet designed to help teachers recognise and plan for a wide variety of high-quality science practical work, ranging from out-of-classroom learning to opportunities for pupils to practise specific techniques and procedures
- **Professional Development Resources**: Materials to support teachers in enhancing their practical work provision
- **Quality Indicators**: Criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of practical activities

The framework emphasised that practical work should be purposeful, well-designed, and effectively integrated with other aspects of science teaching.

### 2. Resourcing Practical Science (2013)

In May 2013, SCORE published a landmark pair of reports that provided the most comprehensive analysis ever undertaken of practical science resourcing in UK schools:

#### Resourcing Practical Science in Primary Schools

This report revealed alarming findings about the state of practical science in primary education:

- Teachers had access to an average of only **46%** of the materials required to teach practical science effectively
- Many primary schools lacked basic laboratory equipment and storage facilities
- Teacher confidence in delivering practical science varied considerably
- Funding for science resources in primary schools was often inadequate and inconsistently allocated

#### Resourcing Practical Science in Secondary Schools and Sixth Form Colleges

The secondary report documented similarly concerning findings:

- State-funded secondary schools had on average only **70%** of the equipment and consumables that SCORE identified as essential
- The situation was particularly acute in certain subject areas, notably chemistry and physics
- Sixth form colleges faced distinct challenges related to advanced practical requirements
- Technicians and support staff were often insufficiently trained or resourced

#### Practical Science Benchmarks

Alongside the resourcing reports, SCORE launched **Practical Science Benchmarks** for both primary and secondary schools. These benchmarks provided:

- Minimum standards for laboratory space, furniture, and storage
- Requirements for equipment and consumables by subject area
- Specifications for technology and digital resources
- Guidance on health and safety provisions
- Recommendations for technician staffing levels

The benchmarks were developed in collaboration with teachers, subject associations, and drew on previous resourcing standards. They were designed to guide both central government policy and local school decision-making on appropriate resource levels.

### 3. Curriculum and Qualifications Reform

SCORE played an active role in policy debates surrounding science curriculum and qualifications reform, including:

- Responding to government consultations on the National Curriculum
- Contributing to discussions about GCSE and A-level science reforms
- Advocating for the preservation of practical assessment in science qualifications
- Promoting the place of science within the broader school curriculum

The partnership consistently argued for a science curriculum that balances substantive knowledge with disciplinary understanding of how science works.

### 4. Teacher Supply and Professional Development

SCORE addressed issues relating to the science teaching workforce, including:

- Recruitment and retention of specialist science teachers
- The importance of subject-specific professional development
- The role of technicians in supporting practical science
- Career pathways for science educators

## Research Methodology and Evidence Base

SCORE's policy positions were grounded in systematic research and evidence gathering. The partnership employed various research methods:

### Quantitative Surveys

Large-scale surveys of schools and colleges provided data on:
- Resource levels and funding
- Equipment availability
- Timetabling and curriculum structures
- Teacher qualifications and specialisms

### Qualitative Research

Case studies and interviews explored:
- Teacher experiences and perspectives
- School decision-making processes
- Classroom implementation challenges
- Successful practice examples

### Stakeholder Consultation

SCORE regularly consulted with:
- Classroom teachers across all phases
- School and college leaders
- Examination boards
- Professional associations
- Industry and employer representatives

This rigorous approach ensured that SCORE's publications represented genuine insight into the state of science education rather than anecdote or assumption.

## Pedagogical Contributions

### Conceptualising Practical Work

SCORE made significant contributions to how educators understand practical work in science. The partnership distinguished between different types of practical activity:

| Type | Purpose | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Illustrative** | Demonstrating phenomena or concepts | Showing magnetic field patterns |
| **Investigative** | Developing enquiry skills | Open-ended investigations |
| **Skills-based** | Developing specific techniques | Using a microscope, titration |
| **Research-style** | Authentic scientific inquiry | Extended projects mimicking real research |

This typology helped teachers design purposeful practical work aligned with specific learning objectives.

### The Importance of Practical Work

SCORE consistently articulated multiple rationales for practical science:

1. **Cognitive**: Practical work develops conceptual understanding by making abstract ideas concrete
2. **Procedural**: Pupils learn the methods and techniques of scientific investigation
3. **Epistemic**: Practical work teaches how scientific knowledge is constructed and validated
4. **Affective**: Hands-on experience generates interest and enthusiasm for science
5. **Career**: Practical skills are essential for those pursuing science-related careers

### Addressing Barriers

SCORE identified and analysed common barriers to effective practical work:

- **Resource constraints**: Insufficient equipment, materials, and facilities
- **Time pressures**: Curriculum demands and examination preparation limiting practical opportunities
- **Assessment structures**: High-stakes testing devaluing practical skills
- **Teacher confidence**: Inadequate subject knowledge or practical expertise
- **Safety concerns**: Over-cautious approaches limiting activity range
- **Behaviour management**: Concerns about classroom control during practical activities

The partnership proposed specific strategies for addressing each barrier, from procurement advice to professional development recommendations.
