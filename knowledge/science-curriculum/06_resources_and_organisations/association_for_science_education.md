# The Association for Science Education (ASE)

## Overview

The Association for Science Education (ASE) is the UK's leading professional body for science educators, with a Royal Charter to "improve the teaching and learning of science." Founded through the merger of the Science Masters Association and the Association of Women Science Teachers in 1963, the ASE traces its origins to 1900, making it one of the oldest and most influential subject associations in British education. As a registered charity (number 313123), the ASE serves a diverse membership including trainee teachers, classroom practitioners, technicians, teacher educators, and school leaders across all phases from early years to post-16 education.

The ASE's influence extends far beyond its membership base. Ofsted (2013) has cited ASE publications as authoritative resources for school-level curriculum development, and the Department for Education regularly engages the ASE in policy consultations affecting science education. The Association's commitment to evidence-informed practice, practical science, and inclusive education has shaped national discourse on how science should be taught in English schools.

## Historical Development

### Origins and Early Years (1900–1963)

The ASE's history reflects the evolving landscape of science education in Britain. The Association for Science Education can trace its origins to 1900, when the first Annual Meeting was held in January 1901. This gathering led to the formation of the Association of Public School Science Masters, which later became the Science Masters Association (SMA). Simultaneously, the Association of Women Science Teachers (AWST) was established to support the growing number of women entering science teaching professions.

The early years were characterised by vigorous debates about science pedagogy, particularly the relative merits of heuristic (discovery-based) approaches versus more structured didactic methods. H.E. Armstrong, a prominent chemistry educator, championed the heuristic method, arguing that pupils should discover scientific principles through direct experimentation rather than passive instruction. These debates, documented in early journal publications, established a tradition of professional dialogue that continues today.

### The 1963 Merger and Expansion

The merger of the SMA and AWST in 1963 created the modern ASE, combining the strengths of both organisations while reflecting the increasingly integrated nature of the teaching profession. This period coincided with major curriculum reforms, including the introduction of comprehensive education and the development of Nuffield Science programmes. The ASE positioned itself as a bridge between academic research and classroom practice, a role it maintains today.

### Modern Era (1990–Present)

The ASE has adapted to successive waves of curriculum reform, including the National Curriculum (introduced 1988), the Science National Strategy (2002–2010), and the 2014 National Curriculum reforms. Throughout these changes, the Association has maintained its core commitment to high-quality science education while responding to emerging challenges such as the integration of digital technologies, the emphasis on working scientifically, and the need to address diversity and inclusion in STEM subjects.

## Core Activities and Services

### Professional Publishing

The ASE's publishing programme represents one of its most significant contributions to science education. The Association produces several journals serving different sectors of the science education community:

#### School Science Review (SSR)

School Science Review is the ASE's flagship academically peer-reviewed journal, targeted at educators working with pupils aged 11–19. Published termly in November, March, and July, SSR provides a forum for sharing research, innovative practice, and subject knowledge updates. The journal is actively supported by several national committees (11–19, Technician, Research, and Health & Safety) to ensure content addresses the diverse needs of the secondary science community.

SSR articles are aimed at new and experienced teachers, teacher trainees, teacher educators, school leaders, Heads of Department, advisers, consultants, and technicians. All articles are published online with accompanying print publications containing selected shorter articles. Online versions include links to further reading, resources, and multimedia content, extending the value of each contribution.

Recent curated collections have addressed climate change and sustainability, practical science relevance for technicians, and overcoming barriers to practical science. These themed collections demonstrate the journal's responsiveness to contemporary educational priorities.

#### Primary Science

Primary Science is the ASE's themed journal for all those involved in science education for children aged 3–12. This publication recognises the distinctive challenges of early years and primary science teaching, including the need to integrate science with broader curriculum areas, develop foundational enquiry skills, and support non-specialist teachers in delivering effective science provision.

The journal includes practical resources such as the Science Swap Shop activities, downloadable PDFs featuring activities from previous issues. The Primary upd8 archive provides engaging science activities for 5–11 year olds, developed through collaboration between the ASE and King's College London. More recent publications include "Primary Science Skills and How to Teach Them," which supports upper primary pupils (aged 7–11) in developing scientific enquiry capabilities.

#### Education in Science and Other Publications

Education in Science (EiS) was the ASE's professional journal, and whilst no longer publishing, it remains a rich archive resource of articles and ideas for members. ASE International addressed the teaching of science from a global perspective, featuring both previously published articles and original material. The Journal of Emergent Science (JES) provides open-access content, while the STE online hub offers additional subscription-based resources.

### Annual Conference

The ASE Annual Conference represents the UK's largest gathering focused on science education professional teaching and learning. The 2025 conference, held at the University of Nottingham's University Park Campus from 9th to 11th January, exemplifies the scale and scope of this event. Generously sponsored by AQA, the conference brings together thousands of educators for three days of workshops, keynotes, and networking.

Recent conferences have featured sessions on artificial intelligence in science education, inclusive practice in the science classroom, SEND provision, microscopy techniques, physics for non-specialists, and practical science demonstrations. The conference incorporates international sessions throughout its programme, reflecting the ASE's global connections and the universal challenges facing science educators.

The ASE 2024 conference schedule included over 126 CPD events attended by nearly 5,000 teachers, technicians, and students. Workshop providers include not only ASE committees and staff but also partner organisations such as CLEAPSS (safety and practical science), SAPS (Science and Plants for Schools), and Gatsby Charitable Foundation's Technical Education Networks programme.

### Continuous Professional Development (CPD)

## Impact on Science Education Policy and Practice

### Curriculum Influence

The ASE has played a significant role in shaping national curriculum developments. The Association's 2010 publication "Principles and Big Ideas of Science Education," edited by Wynne Harlen, was cited by Ofsted (2013) in their influential survey report "Maintaining Curiosity" as a useful school-level cataloguing of the 'big ideas' that should underpin science education. This framework has informed curriculum design in many schools and academies, providing a coherent structure for organising scientific content across key stages.

### Ofsted Recognition

Ofsted's "Maintaining Curiosity" report (2013) explicitly referenced ASE resources as authoritative guidance for schools. The report noted that while the quality of teaching was at least good in the majority of schools visited, lessons often lacked sufficient differentiation to allow pupils—especially the more able—to build on prior learning and make good progress. The ASE's resources on assessment, differentiation, and progression have subsequently supported schools in addressing these identified weaknesses.

### Professional Standards

Through its journals, CPD programmes, and professional networking, the ASE contributes to the development of professional standards for science educators. The Association's emphasis on evidence-informed practice, reflective teaching, and collaborative professional learning aligns with broader movements toward professionalisation of teaching in England.

For science technicians, the ASE works with partner organisations to define career pathways and professional standards, recognising the essential role that technicians play in enabling high-quality practical science.

## Contemporary Priorities and Future Directions

### Inclusive Science Education

Recent ASE conferences and publications have emphasised inclusive practice in the science classroom, addressing the need to support pupils with SEND, close attainment gaps between disadvantaged pupils and their peers, and increase participation in science among underrepresented groups. The Association's Inclusive Practice Project exemplifies this commitment, providing practical guidance on adapting practical work, differentiating instruction, and creating inclusive learning environments.

### Sustainability and Climate Education

The ASE has responded to the climate emergency by developing resources and CPD focused on climate change education and sustainability. Curated collections of School Science Review articles address climate change from scientific, pedagogical, and citizenship perspectives, supporting teachers in addressing this critical topic appropriately across key stages.

### Digital Technologies and AI

Recent CPD events have addressed the integration of artificial intelligence in science education, exploring both the opportunities AI presents for personalising learning and the challenges of ensuring pupils develop genuine scientific understanding in an age of intelligent tools. The ASE's approach balances enthusiasm for technological innovation with critical reflection on pedagogical effectiveness.

### Practical Science

The Association maintains a strong commitment to practical science, working with partners like CLEAPSS to ensure that laboratory work remains central to science education despite resource pressures and safety concerns. Recent journal issues have focused specifically on overcoming barriers to practical science, addressing concerns that practical work has declined in some schools due to budget constraints, assessment pressures, and safety anxiety.
