# The Association for Science Education (ASE)

## Overview and Historical Foundation

The Association for Science Education (ASE) stands as the United Kingdom's largest subject membership association for science educators, representing a cornerstone of professional support for teachers, technicians, and teacher educators across all phases of education. Founded in 1963 through the merger of the Science Masters Association and the Association of Women Science Teachers, the ASE traces its origins to 1900 when the first Annual Meeting of science teachers convened in January 1901, leading to the formation of the Association of Public School Science Masters. The organisation received Royal Charter incorporation in October 2004, operating as a registered charity with the motto "Promoting Excellence in Science Teaching and Learning."

The Royal Charter articulates the ASE's tripartite mission: improving the teaching of science, providing an authoritative medium through which teachers may express opinions on educational matters, and facilitating communication among all persons concerned with science education. This foundational purpose has guided the association through six decades of curriculum change, policy evolution, and pedagogical innovation, establishing ASE as the authoritative voice for science education in the United Kingdom.

The ASE's governance structure reflects its democratic foundations. An elected Education Group comprising thirty members from all sectors of the science education community governs educational affairs, meeting three times annually and led by the Chair of the Association who serves a one-year term elected by the membership. A Trustee Body of eleven member trustees ensures proper charity governance, financial regulation, and policy compliance. This dual structure balances educational expertise with charitable accountability, ensuring the ASE remains responsive to its membership while maintaining institutional stability.

The association's patronage reflects its standing within British scientific and educational circles. Following the death of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh in 2021, HRH Princess Anne, the Princess Royal, assumed the role of Patron. Presidential appointments have included eminent scientists and educators such as Sir Professor John Holman, Professor Danielle George, Professor Alice Roberts, and Professor Martin Rees, Lord Rees of Ludlow, demonstrating the ASE's capacity to bridge the scientific research community with educational practice.

## School Science Review: The Flagship Journal

### Purpose and Scope

The School Science Review (SSR) represents the ASE's academically peer-reviewed flagship publication, specifically supporting science education for learners aged 11-19. Published continuously since the association's formation, SSR serves dual purposes: providing continuing professional development for readers through exposure to current research and best practice, and offering a platform for contributors to share expertise across the ASE community and wider science education network. The journal's peer-review process ensures academic rigour while maintaining accessibility for practitioner readership, bridging the research-practice divide that often characterises educational publishing.

SSR's editorial focus encompasses curriculum development, pedagogical innovation, assessment practices, and disciplinary content knowledge across biology, chemistry, and physics. The journal addresses the full range of secondary science provision, from Key Stage 3 through GCSE and into A-Level and equivalent post-16 qualifications. This comprehensive scope recognises the interconnected nature of secondary science education, where foundational concepts at Key Stage 3 underpin advanced study, and pedagogical approaches must adapt to learners' developing cognitive capacities and disciplinary understanding.

### Content Organisation and Accessibility

The ASE organises SSR content through curated thematic collections, enabling readers to access relevant articles by topic across multiple issues. This curation addresses the practical needs of busy educators who may seek guidance on specific curriculum areas or pedagogical challenges without reviewing entire back catalogues. Recent thematic collections have addressed curriculum design principles, practical work in science, assessment for learning, and the integration of contemporary scientific developments into classroom practice.

SSR's "SSR in Practice" series deserves particular attention as a bridge between academic research and classroom application. These focused sections present actionable guidance derived from research findings, case studies from practising teachers, and reflections on implementation challenges. The November 2024 issue exemplified this approach through articles exploring curriculum priorities during the government's Curriculum and Assessment Review, alongside practical classroom strategies such as Jon Hale's investigation of decay and decomposition using teabags—a demonstration of how everyday materials can illuminate complex biological processes.

### Membership Access and Distribution

SSR is included as a core membership benefit, with members selecting either SSR or Primary Science as their complimentary journal upon joining. This choice reflects the ASE's recognition that members typically specialise in specific phases, though many educators transition between primary and secondary contexts or hold responsibilities spanning both. Members may manage journal preferences through their online account, enabling transitions as career paths evolve. Additional journal subscriptions, including access to the Science Teacher Education Hub, may be added to membership packages for educators seeking comprehensive professional reading.

The journal's distribution model has evolved with digital publishing capabilities. While print editions maintain their value for institutional libraries and members preferring physical reading, online access enables immediate availability of new issues and searchable archives of previous content. This dual-format approach ensures accessibility across preferences while reducing environmental impact and distribution costs.

## Professional Development and CPD Provision

### Annual Conference

The ASE Annual Conference constitutes the UK's largest science education professional development event, attracting over 2,000 delegates for three days of intensive learning, networking, and resource exploration. The 2026 conference, held from 8-10 January at the University of Nottingham in partnership with AQA, exemplifies the scale and scope of ASE's CPD offering. With over 220 sessions including keynote addresses, workshops, academic lectures, and themed programme days, the conference provides comprehensive coverage of contemporary issues in science education.

The conference programme reflects ASE's commitment to serving diverse professional needs. Technical staff benefit from dedicated technician sessions addressing laboratory management, equipment maintenance, and health and safety compliance. Early career teachers participate in targeted programming supporting induction and development. Subject leaders and senior leaders engage with strategic sessions on curriculum design, department management, and whole-school science policy. This tiered approach ensures relevance across career stages while fostering cross-phase dialogue and collaboration.

The exhibition component provides delegates with direct access to publishers, examination boards, equipment suppliers, and educational organisations. This marketplace function enables educators to evaluate resources, negotiate institutional purchases, and establish relationships with providers that support ongoing teaching and learning. The 2026 conference acknowledges sponsorship from Educake Ltd for the 11-19 programme and Philip Harris for practical science resources, demonstrating the commercial partnerships that sustain conference programming while maintaining editorial independence.

### Teacher Development Trust Recognition

The Teacher Development Trust, a leading voice in CPD quality assurance, has recognised ASE conference provision as exemplifying effective professional development characteristics. ASE programmes demonstrate focus on pupil learning outcomes, underpinning by robust evidence and expertise, collaborative learning structures, and facilitation of longer-term professional relationships. This external validation confirms that ASE CPD extends beyond information transmission to genuine professional learning that transforms classroom practice.

The Trust's assessment highlighted the ASE's success in creating challenging learning environments where educators encounter research findings, engage with expert practitioners, and develop actionable strategies for implementation. The conference's scale enables specialisation—delegates select sessions aligned with specific development needs—while communal spaces foster serendipitous connections and cross-pollination of ideas across specialisms and phases.

### Chartered Science Teacher (CSciTeach)

The ASE administers the Chartered Science Teacher designation in partnership with the Science Council, offering a professional accreditation that recognises excellence in science education practice. This chartered status provides a career milestone for experienced practitioners, establishing parity with chartered professionals in other scientific fields and acknowledging the sophisticated expertise required for effective science teaching.

The CSciTeach framework requires demonstration of competence across four domains: professional values and personal commitment, professional knowledge and understanding, professional and personal attributes, and professional practice. Applicants compile portfolios evidencing sustained excellence, engage with professional development activities, and undergo rigorous assessment. Successful candidates join a register of chartered professionals, gaining recognition that supports career progression, leadership opportunities, and professional credibility.

The ASE also supports registration as Registered Scientist and Registered Science Technician, creating progression pathways for technical staff and those in supporting roles. These designations recognise the diverse professional contributions within science education departments, extending chartered status principles beyond teaching staff to encompass the full range of professionals enabling effective science provision.

## Publication Portfolio and Resources

### Primary Science

Primary Science, previously published as Primary Science Review, serves the specific needs of educators working with learners in early years and primary phases. The journal provides lesson ideas, curriculum developments, and pedagogical guidance tailored to primary contexts where generalist teachers often deliver science provision. Content addresses the distinctive challenges of teaching scientific concepts to young learners, including the integration of science with other curriculum areas, the use of outdoor environments for scientific exploration, and the development of scientific enquiry skills through play-based and experiential learning.

The journal maintains strong connections with the Primary Science Teaching Trust (PSTT), reflecting the ASE's collaborative approach to sector development. PSTT support enables additional resources, fellowship programmes, and dissemination networks that extend Primary Science's reach and impact across the primary sector.

### Science Teacher Education Hub

The Science Teacher Education (STE) Hub represents ASE's evolution from traditional journal publishing to dynamic online professional learning platforms. Replacing the former STE journal, the Hub provides content specifically for initial teacher training providers and those engaged in science teacher education across all phases. This targeted publication addresses the distinctive needs of teacher educators—those responsible for preparing the next generation of science teachers—who require access to research on professional development, programme design, and assessment of teaching competence.

The Hub's online format enables multimedia content, discussion forums, and regular updates that would be impossible within print publishing constraints. Contributors include leading researchers in science teacher education, policy makers, and practising teacher educators sharing innovative approaches from their institutional contexts. Subscription to the STE Hub may be added to standard ASE membership, reflecting its specialist audience while remaining accessible to members seeking to expand their engagement with teacher education discourse.

### Journal of Emergent Science

The Journal of Emergent Science (JES), produced in partnership with the Primary Science Teaching Trust, focuses specifically on research and implications for practice concerning science education for children from birth to eleven years. This publication addresses early childhood science education—a field often underrepresented in general science education journals—recognising that scientific thinking and identity formation begin in early years settings long before formal schooling.

JES operates as an open-access publication, ensuring research findings reach practitioners regardless of institutional subscription access or individual membership status. This accessibility aligns with the ASE's charitable objectives and PSTT's commitment to improving primary science provision through evidence-informed practice.

### Education in Science Archive

The archive of Education in Science (EiS), ASE's former professional journal, remains available to members as a historical resource documenting the evolution of science education policy and practice. This archive provides researchers and educators with primary source material tracing curriculum development from the 1960s through recent reforms, offering context for contemporary debates and demonstrating the cyclical nature of educational policy.

## Curriculum Influence and Policy Engagement

The ASE's influence extends beyond individual professional development to systemic curriculum and policy engagement. The association's Education Group speaks authoritatively on behalf of the science education community, submitting responses to government consultations, contributing to curriculum review processes, and representing teacher perspectives in policy forums. This advocacy function ensures that practitioner experience informs policy development, counterbalancing theoretical perspectives and political imperatives with grounded understanding of classroom realities.

The association's Royal Charter explicitly empowers the ASE to serve as "an authoritative medium through which opinions of teachers of science may be expressed on educational matters." This mandate positions ASE as the democratic voice of the profession, aggregating and articulating teacher perspectives that might otherwise remain unheard in policy discourse. The Education Group's representative composition—all sectors, all phases, all regions—ensures this voice reflects the profession's diversity rather than privileging particular perspectives.

ASE engagement with the 2024-2025 Curriculum and Assessment Review exemplifies this policy function. Through SSR articles, conference sessions, and direct consultation responses, the association contributed to national debate about curriculum priorities, assessment arrangements, and the balance between disciplinary knowledge and scientific enquiry. The November 2024 SSR issue's focus on curriculum matters demonstrated the journal's capacity to generate timely professional discourse responsive to policy developments.

## Practical Pedagogical Resources

Beyond journal publications, ASE provides extensive practical resources supporting day-to-day teaching. The ASE Resource Hub curates materials developed by the association and its members, including lesson plans, practical protocols, safety guidance, and assessment resources. These materials undergo professional review, ensuring quality and safety compliance while remaining adaptable to diverse institutional contexts.

The association's resources address persistent challenges in science education: the effective use of practical work, the integration of contemporary science into curricula, differentiation for diverse learners, and assessment of scientific enquiry skills. By aggregating practitioner-developed resources and subjecting them to peer review, ASE creates a knowledge commons that elevates individual teacher expertise to collective professional property.

Safety guidance constitutes a particularly valuable resource category, given the regulatory and ethical obligations surrounding practical science. ASE maintains current guidance on laboratory safety, chemical storage, risk assessment, and emerging technologies, enabling departments to maintain compliance while maximising practical learning opportunities. This guidance carries significant weight in institutional audit and inspection contexts, with Ofsted and professional regulators recognising ASE publications as authoritative benchmarks.

## Membership Benefits and Community

ASE membership provides comprehensive professional support beyond journal access. Members receive discounted or complimentary access to CPD events including the Annual Conference, preferential rates on publications and resources, and voting rights in association governance. The membership structure accommodates career stages, with differential rates for trainees, early career teachers, experienced practitioners, and retired educators.

The community function of ASE membership merits particular emphasis. Science educators—particularly those in small departments or isolated contexts—benefit from connection to a national network of colleagues sharing common challenges and aspirations. The Annual Conference, regional events, and online forums create spaces for this community to develop, mitigating the isolation that can accompany specialist teaching roles. Research on teacher retention consistently identifies professional community as a protective factor; ASE membership provides this community infrastructure for science educators.

Membership also signals professional commitment. Chartered status, active participation in ASE events, and contribution to ASE publications enhance professional profiles and support career progression. Many science department leaders, senior leaders, and teacher educators maintain ASE membership throughout their careers, sustaining connection to classroom practice and emerging developments in the field.

## Impact and Evaluation

The ASE's impact on UK science education, while difficult to quantify precisely, manifests across multiple indicators. The association's journals appear in institutional libraries throughout the education sector, supporting initial teacher education and ongoing professional development. ASE conference attendance consistently reaches capacity, demonstrating sustained demand for the professional learning provided. Chartered Science Teacher registrations continue to grow, establishing a cadre of recognised expert practitioners.

More fundamentally, the ASE's influence operates through the cumulative impact of individual members' enhanced practice. Teachers applying research-informed strategies encountered in SSR, implementing practical protocols from ASE resources, and applying curriculum insights from conference sessions generate improved learner outcomes across countless classrooms. This distributed impact—mediated through individual teacher agency rather than direct intervention—represents the ASE's most significant contribution to science education quality.

The Teacher Development Trust's recognition of ASE conference provision, the Science Council's partnership for chartered status, and government consultation of ASE perspectives in policy development all constitute external validation of the association's professional standing. These recognitions position ASE within broader educational and scientific ecosystems, ensuring science teacher perspectives inform developments across the sector.

## Future Directions and Challenges

The ASE faces ongoing challenges characteristic of professional associations in the contemporary educational landscape. Digital transformation offers opportunities for enhanced reach and accessibility while threatening traditional membership and publishing models. The association's development of the STE Hub and digital journal access demonstrates adaptive response, though sustainable business models for online professional learning remain emergent across the sector.

Curriculum reform cycles require continuous engagement, with the 2024-2025 Curriculum and Assessment Review representing the latest in a series of national restructuring exercises. ASE's capacity to generate rapid professional response—evidenced by timely SSR content and conference programming—positions the association as essential infrastructure for curriculum implementation. However, this responsive function requires resources and expertise that member subscriptions alone may struggle to sustain.

Teacher retention crises affect science education particularly acutely, given the competitive labour market for science graduates and the specialised nature of science teaching expertise. ASE's community function, professional recognition pathways, and CPD provision all contribute to retention by enhancing job satisfaction and career development opportunities. The association's advocacy for science teacher professionalism addresses structural conditions affecting retention, though systemic solutions require policy intervention beyond any professional association's capacity.

Climate change, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and other emerging scientific developments present curriculum and pedagogical challenges requiring rapid professional updating. ASE's role in disseminating contemporary science and supporting its integration into teaching practice grows increasingly significant as the pace of scientific change accelerates. The association's connections with research scientists through presidential appointments and conference participation create pathways for translating cutting-edge science into classroom-accessible content.
