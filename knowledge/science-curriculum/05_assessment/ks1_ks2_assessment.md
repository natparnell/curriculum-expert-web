# KS1 and KS2 Science Assessment: Teacher Assessment Frameworks, Sampling Tests and Moderation

## 1. Introduction: Assessment in Primary Science

Assessment in primary science serves multiple purposes within the educational ecosystem of England. Unlike mathematics and English, where statutory national tests (SATs) operate at Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2, science assessment follows a different model that combines teacher assessment with periodic national sampling. This distinction reflects both the practical challenges of standardised science testing for young children and the recognition that effective science education requires diverse forms of evidence that extend beyond written examination.

The current framework for science assessment emerged from significant reforms to the national curriculum and assessment system, particularly following the removal of statutory science tests at Key Stage 2 in 2010 and the subsequent introduction of the science sampling programme. These changes shifted the locus of assessment responsibility towards teachers whilst maintaining mechanisms for national monitoring and standardisation through the sampling approach.

Understanding the architecture of primary science assessment is essential for curriculum leaders, subject coordinators and classroom practitioners. The system encompasses statutory teacher assessment frameworks, optional but recommended assessment materials, the biennial science sampling test administered by the Standards and Testing Agency (STA), and moderation processes designed to ensure consistency and reliability of teacher judgements across schools and local authorities.

This knowledge file examines each component of the primary science assessment landscape, providing practical guidance on implementation whilst situating current practice within the broader policy context of the Department for Education's assessment strategy and Ofsted's expectations for curriculum evaluation.

## 2. Statutory Teacher Assessment Frameworks

### 2.1 The Teacher Assessment Framework (TAF) Structure

The Teacher Assessment Framework (TAF) for science at Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 represents the statutory minimum threshold for determining whether pupils have met the expected standard in science at the end of each key stage. Unlike the frameworks for reading, writing and mathematics, which prescribe detailed 'pupil can' statements, the science TAF operates at a broader level of description, reflecting the practical and investigatory nature of the subject.

At Key Stage 1, the TAF requires teachers to make a holistic judgement based on evidence gathered throughout Years 1 and 2. The expected standard descriptor states that pupils working at the expected standard will demonstrate sufficient knowledge and understanding of the content taught within the key stage, applying this knowledge through working scientifically approaches including observing, grouping and classifying, and performing simple tests.

Key Stage 2 follows a similar structure, with teacher assessments made at the end of Year 6. The expected standard requires pupils to demonstrate secure understanding of the Year 3-6 programme of study content and the ability to work scientifically across the range of enquiry types specified in the national curriculum. The TAF explicitly notes that pupils should be able to make decisions about the most appropriate enquiry approaches and explain their findings using scientific vocabulary appropriate to their age.

### 2.2 Working Scientifically in Assessment

The integration of 'working scientifically' into teacher assessment represents one of the most significant shifts in the 2014 national curriculum and its associated assessment frameworks. Working scientifically is not taught as a separate strand but rather embedded within the teaching of substantive science content, and assessment must reflect this integrated approach.

The TAF identifies specific working scientifically skills that should inform teacher judgements. At Key Stage 1, these include observing closely using simple equipment, performing simple tests, identifying and classifying, and using observations and ideas to suggest answers to questions. Teachers must assess whether pupils can demonstrate these skills independently and consistently across different contexts, not merely as isolated performances.

At Key Stage 2, the expectations advance considerably. Pupils working at the expected standard should demonstrate the ability to plan different types of scientific enquiries, take measurements with increasing accuracy and precision, record data using scientific diagrams and labels, and use results to draw conclusions and make predictions. The TAF emphasises that assessment should capture pupils' growing independence in scientific enquiry and their developing ability to evaluate the reliability of their methods and data.

### 2.3 Evidence Requirements

The Department for Education guidance on teacher assessment emphasises that no single piece of evidence is required, and teachers should draw upon a range of sources to build a comprehensive picture of pupil attainment. Acceptable evidence types include:

**Observational records** of pupils engaged in practical science activities, noting their approach to enquiry, manipulation of equipment, and collaborative working. These observations may be captured through teacher annotation, photographs (with appropriate permissions), or video recording for moderation purposes.

**Written work** produced by pupils, including science book entries, worksheets, project books, and formal write-ups of investigations. The TAF explicitly cautions against over-reliance on written evidence alone, recognising that scientific understanding may be demonstrated through oral explanation, practical demonstration, or alternative recording methods.

**Formal assessment materials** such as those produced by the Standards and Testing Agency or commercially available assessment packages. Whilst not statutory, these materials can provide useful benchmarking against national standards and support moderation processes.

**Dialogue and questioning** captured through planned assessment opportunities or incidental conversations. The TAF encourages teachers to capture pupil voice as part of the assessment process, noting that explanations given during practical work often reveal understanding that written work alone cannot demonstrate.

## 3. KS2 Science Sampling Tests

### 3.1 Purpose and Design

The KS2 Science Sampling Test represents the only remaining element of statutory national testing in primary science. Introduced following the removal of universal science SATs in 2010, the sampling programme operates on a biennial cycle, with the most recent tests administered in 2023 and the next scheduled for 2025.

The sampling approach involves approximately 9,000 pupils selected randomly from across England, with selected schools required to participate in the testing programme. This design allows the Department for Education and Ofqual to monitor national standards in science without imposing testing burdens on all schools and pupils. The results provide national-level data on science attainment but do not produce individual pupil scores or school-level performance data.

The sampling tests are administered by trained administrators external to the school, ensuring standardised conditions and removing the burden of test administration from teachers. Tests typically take place over a two-week window in June, with the timing designed to capture attainment near the end of Key Stage 2 whilst avoiding conflicts with the main KS2 SATs period for English and mathematics.

### 3.2 Test Structure and Content Coverage

The KS2 Science Sampling Test comprises three separate papers designed to assess the full range of the Key Stage 2 science programme of study. The structure has remained broadly consistent since the programme's inception, with each paper targeting specific content domains and working scientifically skills.

**Paper 1: Biology** assesses content from the Year 3-6 biology programme of study, including plants, animals including humans, living things and their habitats, and evolution and inheritance. Questions range from straightforward knowledge recall to application of understanding in unfamiliar contexts. Working scientifically questions embedded within Paper 1 assess skills relevant to biological enquiry, such as observation, classification, and interpretation of data about living things.

**Paper 2: Chemistry** covers materials and their properties, changes of state, and the properties and changes of materials content from the programme of study. This paper includes questions about reversible and irreversible changes, the water cycle, and uses of everyday materials. Working scientifically elements focus on fair testing, measurement of properties, and evaluation of investigations involving materials.

**Paper 3: Physics** addresses the physics content of Key Stage 2, including light, forces and magnets, sound, electricity, and Earth and space. Questions assess conceptual understanding of physical phenomena and their applications. Working scientifically assessment in Paper 3 focuses on prediction, systematic observation, and the analysis of patterns in physical data.

Each paper includes a mixture of question types: multiple choice, structured short-answer, and open-response questions requiring more extended explanations. The balance of question types reflects both the need for reliable marking and the desire to assess deeper understanding and application of knowledge.

### 3.3 Use of Sampling Test Outcomes

Schools selected for the sampling programme receive summary feedback on their pupils' performance, though individual pupil results are not provided. This feedback includes comparative data against national averages, information on performance across the three content domains, and analysis of working scientifically skills demonstrated.

The primary use of sampling test data is for national monitoring. The Department for Education publishes national reports following each sampling cycle, providing insights into trends in science attainment over time and highlighting areas where national performance may be weaker. These reports inform policy decisions and curriculum guidance, though they carry no direct accountability consequences for individual schools.

For schools participating in sampling, the experience can provide valuable professional development opportunities. The requirement to prepare pupils for external science assessment, even on a sampling basis, often prompts schools to review their science curriculum and assessment practices. Many schools use the sampling test format and released materials to inform their own assessment approaches, even when not selected for participation.

## 4. Assessment Without Levels: The Current Landscape

### 4.1 Post-2014 Assessment Arrangements

The removal of national curriculum levels in 2014 fundamentally changed how primary science attainment is described and tracked. The old system of Level 1-6 descriptors has been replaced by the binary 'working at the expected standard'/'not working at the expected standard' judgement at the end of each key stage, supplemented by interim 'working towards' and 'working at greater depth' descriptors at Key Stage 1.

This shift represents more than mere administrative change; it reflects a deliberate policy move away from fine-grained differentiation towards a focus on whether pupils have mastered the curriculum content for their key stage. For science, where practical skills and conceptual understanding develop along non-linear pathways, the new framework presents both opportunities and challenges for assessment.

The Department for Education has consistently maintained that schools have the freedom to develop their own assessment systems for ongoing tracking throughout key stages, provided that statutory end-of-key-stage assessments follow the TAF. This autonomy has led to considerable variation in approaches, with some schools adapting legacy level-based systems whilst others have developed new mastery-oriented frameworks.

### 4.2 Formative Assessment in Science

Beyond statutory assessment, effective primary science teaching relies upon ongoing formative assessment embedded within daily practice. The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) identifies diagnostic assessment and feedback as high-impact strategies for improving science outcomes, particularly for disadvantaged pupils.

Formative assessment in science presents particular opportunities due to the subject's practical nature. Teachers can gather evidence through:

**Pre-topic assessments** that identify pupils' existing ideas and misconceptions before new content is introduced. These assessments are particularly important in science, where research consistently shows that children enter school with established ideas about physical phenomena that may conflict with scientific concepts.

**Hinge questions** asked at critical points in lessons to determine whether pupils have grasped key concepts before moving on. In science, hinge questions often probe conceptual understanding rather than factual recall, requiring pupils to apply their learning to new situations.

**Self and peer assessment** of practical work and investigations, developing pupils' metacognitive awareness and their ability to evaluate scientific evidence critically.

**Practical demonstrations** used formatively, where teachers observe pupils' manipulation of equipment, their recording of observations, and their explanations of phenomena.

The Teacher Assessment Framework guidance explicitly encourages schools to develop robust formative assessment systems that support the end-of-key-stage summative judgements. Schools with strong formative practices typically find that statutory assessment becomes a natural culmination of ongoing evidence gathering rather than a separate, high-stakes activity.

## 5. Moderation Processes

### 5.1 Local Authority Moderation

Local authorities (LAs) have statutory responsibility for moderating teacher assessment judgements in science at Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2. This moderation is designed to ensure consistency and accuracy of assessment across schools, and participation is mandatory for all maintained schools.

The moderation process operates on a sampling basis, with schools selected for moderation required to provide evidence portfolios for specified pupils. Selection criteria include schools with limited previous moderation experience, schools with outlier results compared to previous years, and random sampling to ensure broad coverage.

Schools selected for Key Stage 1 science moderation must provide evidence portfolios demonstrating how teacher judgements have been reached. Moderators scrutinise the range and quality of evidence, assess whether the TAF criteria have been applied correctly, and may discuss individual cases with teachers to understand the basis for judgements. The process focuses on whether pupils have met the expected standard, not on the specific levels of individual pieces of work.

Key Stage 2 moderation follows a similar pattern, though with additional emphasis on the working scientifically elements given their prominence in the end-of-key-stage expectations. Moderators look for evidence that pupils can work scientifically across the full range of enquiry types, not merely in isolated investigations.

### 5.2 Cross-School and Academy Trust Moderation

Beyond statutory LA moderation, many schools participate in voluntary cross-school moderation arrangements. These collaborative approaches are particularly prevalent within multi-academy trusts, where trust-wide science moderation can ensure consistency across schools and support professional development.

Cross-school moderation typically involves groups of teachers meeting to review anonymised work samples, discuss boundary cases, and agree standards. The process develops teachers' assessment literacy and builds shared understanding of the TAF criteria. Research by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) suggests that schools engaging in regular cross-school moderation demonstrate greater reliability in teacher assessment judgements.

For academy trusts, moderation can be organised at trust level with subject specialists or external advisors facilitating the process. This approach allows trusts to align assessment practices across their schools whilst maintaining local flexibility to reflect different contexts and curriculum emphases.

### 5.3 Internal Moderation Within Schools

Effective internal moderation is essential for ensuring consistency of teacher assessment across different classes and year groups within a school. Primary science subject leaders typically coordinate internal moderation, organising termly or half-termly meetings where teachers review samples of work and discuss assessment decisions.

Internal moderation serves multiple functions: it develops shared understanding of standards among all staff teaching science; it identifies areas where curriculum coverage may be inconsistent between classes; and it supports new or less experienced teachers in applying the TAF accurately.

Many schools maintain moderation folders or portfolios containing annotated work samples that exemplify the expected standard and the greater depth standard (where applicable). These resources support ongoing professional development and provide reference points for teachers making day-to-day assessment decisions.

## 6. Assessment Materials and Resources

### 6.1 Standards and Testing Agency Materials

The Standards and Testing Agency provides a range of materials to support teacher assessment in science. These include the Teacher Assessment Frameworks themselves, exemplification materials showing annotated work samples at different standards, and guidance documents explaining the assessment requirements.

The exemplification materials are particularly valuable for moderation and professional development purposes. They present real pupil work across the range of attainment, with detailed commentary explaining how each piece contributes to the overall teacher assessment judgement. Schools selected for statutory moderation are encouraged to review these materials as part of their preparation.

STA also releases materials from the science sampling tests following each testing cycle. These include past papers, mark schemes, and national commentary on pupil performance. Whilst designed for the sampling programme, these materials can inform schools' own assessment approaches and provide insight into the types of questions and thinking skills that characterise national standards.

### 6.2 Commercial Assessment Packages

A market of commercial assessment resources exists to support schools in implementing ongoing assessment without levels. These packages vary considerably in approach, from those retaining elements of the old level descriptors to those adopting pure mastery models where assessment focuses on depth of understanding rather than progression through stages.

Schools selecting commercial assessment systems for science should consider:

**Alignment with the national curriculum** — ensuring that content coverage matches the statutory programme of study and that working scientifically is adequately represented.

**Assessment burden** — avoiding systems that generate excessive recording and tracking workload without clear benefits for teaching and learning.

**Flexibility** — recognising that science assessment requires diverse evidence types and systems that cannot capture practical work, dialogue, and extended investigation may provide an incomplete picture of attainment.

**Moderation support** — considering whether the assessment system includes exemplification and moderation materials that will support accurate teacher judgement.

### 6.3 Subject Association Resources

The Association for Science Education (ASE) and other subject associations provide assessment resources specifically designed for primary science. These materials typically emphasise assessment approaches that align with effective science pedagogy, including assessment of practical skills, diagnostic tools for identifying misconceptions, and approaches to embedding assessment within enquiry-based teaching.

The Primary Science Teaching Trust (PSTT) offers assessment resources developed through research projects, including tools for assessing working scientifically and approaches to developing teacher assessment expertise. These resources often reflect current research on science education and assessment, providing evidence-informed alternatives to purely commercial packages.

## 7. Challenges and Considerations

### 7.1 The Practical Science Assessment Challenge

The practical nature of primary science creates inherent tensions for assessment systems designed primarily for written evidence. Teachers must make professional judgements about practical capabilities based on observation, dialogue, and performance over time, rather than through standardised written tests.

This challenge is acknowledged in the TAF, which explicitly allows for evidence from practical work to inform teacher assessments. However, capturing and recording practical evidence in ways that support moderation and provide robust accountability can be demanding. Schools must develop systems for documenting observations and ensuring that assessment decisions are traceable to observable evidence.

### 7.2 Primary Teacher Science Subject Knowledge

Research consistently identifies primary teachers' science subject knowledge as a significant factor in assessment accuracy. Teachers with limited science background may struggle to distinguish between superficially correct responses and genuine conceptual understanding, or to identify the significance of particular misconceptions.

Professional development in science assessment should therefore include attention to subject knowledge as well as assessment mechanics. Moderation processes provide valuable opportunities for developing subject knowledge alongside assessment expertise, particularly when they involve discussion of the scientific reasoning underlying pupils' work.

### 7.3 Consistency Across School Types

The diversity of primary school types — including maintained schools, academies, free schools, and independent schools — creates challenges for national consistency in science assessment. Whilst the TAF applies universally, implementation varies considerably based on school priorities, resources, and expertise.

Ofsted inspection of science has increased focus on assessment practices, with inspectors examining whether schools have robust systems for identifying pupils who are falling behind and for challenging higher-attaining pupils appropriately. This scrutiny has prompted many schools to review their science assessment approaches, though concerns remain about consistency of expectations across different school contexts.

## 8. Future Developments and Conclusion

### 8.1 Potential Reforms

The landscape of primary assessment remains under policy review, with periodic discussions about the future of the science sampling programme and the broader teacher assessment framework. The Department for Education has indicated no immediate plans to reintroduce universal science testing, but the sampling programme is regularly evaluated and could be modified or replaced in future assessment cycles.

Emerging debates include questions about the timing of science sampling (whether testing should move earlier or later in the year), the balance of content domain coverage, and the potential for technology-enhanced assessment that could capture practical skills more authentically. Any reforms will need to balance the desire for robust national data against the burden of assessment on schools and the particular challenges of assessing practical science capabilities.

### 8.2 Integration with Curriculum Intent

Ofsted's education inspection framework places increasing emphasis on the alignment between curriculum intent, implementation, and impact. For science assessment, this means ensuring that assessment practices genuinely reflect what the curriculum intends pupils to learn and can do, rather than becoming disconnected measuring exercises.

Schools developing their science curricula should consider assessment at the design stage, ensuring that intended learning outcomes are assessable through the types of evidence that the TAF recognises. This integrated approach prevents the common problem where curriculum ambition exceeds what can be reliably assessed, or where assessment practices drive curriculum narrowing.

### 8.3 Professional Development Priorities

The complexity of primary science assessment demands ongoing professional development for teachers and subject leaders. Priority areas for development include:

**Assessment literacy** — developing teachers' understanding of the TAF criteria, the types of evidence required, and the distinction between formative and summative assessment purposes.

**Subject knowledge enhancement** — supporting teachers to recognise secure scientific understanding and to identify significant misconceptions that may affect assessment judgements.

**Moderation skills** — building teachers' capacity to participate effectively in internal, cross-school, and local authority moderation processes.

**Evidence management** — developing efficient systems for collecting, organising, and presenting assessment evidence that meets moderation requirements without creating excessive workload.

### 8.4 Conclusion

Primary science assessment in England represents a distinctive approach that balances teacher professional judgement with national monitoring through sampling. The Teacher Assessment Frameworks provide the statutory foundation for end-of-key-stage assessment, whilst the science sampling programme ensures that national standards can be tracked over time.

The practical nature of science makes assessment inherently complex, requiring teachers to gather and evaluate evidence from diverse sources including practical work, written outcomes, and pupil dialogue. Moderation processes at local authority, trust, and school levels provide essential quality assurance and professional development opportunities.

As the education landscape continues to evolve, primary science assessment will need to adapt whilst maintaining its focus on capturing the full range of pupils' scientific learning. The challenge for schools and policymakers alike is to ensure that assessment serves learning — providing useful information to teachers, pupils, and parents without distorting the science curriculum or creating unsustainable workload burdens.

Effective assessment in primary science ultimately depends on teachers who understand both the subject they are teaching and the assessment framework they are working within. Investment in professional development, collaborative moderation, and high-quality assessment resources will remain essential for maintaining and improving the quality of science assessment across England's primary schools.
