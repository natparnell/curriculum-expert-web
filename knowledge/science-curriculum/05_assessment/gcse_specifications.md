# GCSE Science Specifications: AQA, Edexcel, and OCR

## Overview

GCSE Science qualifications in England are offered by three main awarding bodies: AQA, Pearson Edexcel, and OCR. Each provides both **Combined Science** (awarded as two GCSEs) and **Separate Sciences** (Triple Science, awarded as three individual GCSEs in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics). All specifications follow the Department for Education (DfE) subject content requirements and are regulated by Ofqual.

Understanding the distinctions between these specifications is essential for curriculum leaders, as each awarding body structures their content, assessment, and practical requirements differently, with implications for teaching approaches, resource allocation, and student outcomes.

## Combined Science versus Triple Science

### Combined Science (Double Award)

Combined Science provides students with a broad grounding across all three sciences, resulting in two GCSE grades (9-9 to 1-1). This pathway is suitable for the majority of students and provides sufficient foundation for further study at A-Level for those who achieve strong grades.

**Key characteristics:**
- Content from Biology, Chemistry, and Physics is integrated or coordinated
- Reduced content coverage compared to separate sciences (approximately two-thirds of the Triple Science content)
- Two GCSE grades awarded on a 17-point scale (9-9, 9-8, 8-8, etc.)
- Required practicals from all three disciplines
- Appropriate for students pursuing mixed GCSE portfolios

### Triple Science (Separate Sciences)

Triple Science awards three separate GCSEs: Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. This pathway provides greater depth and is typically offered to students with strong prior attainment in science.

**Key characteristics:**
- Full content coverage for each discipline
- Three separate GCSE grades (9-1)
- Extended required practical programme
- Stronger preparation for A-Level sciences
- Often used as a differentiator for high-attaining students
- May involve additional teaching time (though not statutorily required)

### Curriculum Planning Considerations

When deciding between Combined and Triple Science pathways, departments should consider:

- **Student prior attainment**: Triple Science requires strong foundational knowledge from KS3
- **Timetable allocation**: Some schools allocate more time to Triple Science, though this is not a regulatory requirement
- **Post-16 aspirations**: Students intending to study multiple sciences at A-Level benefit from Triple Science coverage
- **Staffing expertise**: Triple Science requires specialist teaching across all three disciplines
- **Progression data**: Historical evidence of outcomes for different student groups

The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) notes that grouping decisions can have significant impact on student outcomes, with evidence suggesting that flexible grouping strategies may benefit student attainment more than rigid setting approaches.

## Required Practical Programmes Across All Specifications

### Pedagogical Rationale

The required practical programme, introduced as part of the 2016 GCSE reforms, serves multiple purposes:

1. **Ensuring practical experience**: All students must complete hands-on practical work
2. **Developing practical skills**: Systematic approach to experimental techniques
3. **Assessment of practical competency**: Practical skills assessed via written examination
4. **Preparation for further study**: Foundation for A-Level practical requirements

Ofsted's 2023 science subject report emphasised that "the best schools ensure that practical work is not simply a box-ticking exercise but is integral to developing students' understanding of scientific concepts."

### Common Practical Assessment Criteria (CPAC)

While CPAC formal assessment was removed from GCSE following the pandemic, the underlying competencies remain essential:

1. **Follows written procedures**: Ability to follow instructions and methods
2. **Applies investigative approaches**: Identifies variables and controls
3. **Safely uses a range of practical equipment and materials**: Proper technique and safety awareness
4. **Makes and records observations**: Accurate measurement and data recording
5. **Researches, references and reports**: Investigates background context and presents findings

### Practical Implementation Strategies

Effective practical programmes require:

**Resource planning:**
- Equipment audit and maintenance schedules
- Consumables ordering and storage
- Technician support allocation
- Risk assessment documentation

**Pedagogical integration:**
- Linking practicals to theoretical content
- Developing practical skills progressively
- Providing opportunities for open-ended investigation
- Using practical work to address misconceptions

**Assessment preparation:**
