# A Level Science Specifications: Biology, Chemistry and Physics

## Overview of A Level Science Qualifications

A Level science qualifications in England are offered by three main awarding bodies: AQA, OCR, and Pearson Edexcel. All A Level science qualifications follow the subject criteria established by Ofqual and include both written examinations and a Practical Endorsement. The reformed A Levels, first taught from September 2015, represent a significant shift from previous specifications, with a stronger emphasis on practical skills, mathematical rigour, and conceptual understanding.

The structure of A Level science qualifications is standardised across awarding bodies. Students complete three externally examined papers at the end of their two-year course, with the Practical Endorsement reported separately as a Pass or Not Classified. This separation reflects the decoupling of practical skills assessment from the overall A Level grade, a change that has generated considerable debate within the science education community.

## AQA A Level Specifications

### AQA A Level Biology (7401/7402)

AQA's A Level Biology specification is organised into eight topic areas that span biological concepts from molecules to ecosystems. The AS specification (7401) covers topics including biological molecules, cells, organisms exchange substances with their environment, and genetic information. The full A Level (7402) extends this foundation with energy transfers, responses to internal and external environments, genetics, populations, evolution, and ecosystems, plus the control of gene expression.

The assessment structure comprises three written papers, each contributing to the final A Level grade. Paper 1 examines topics 1–4, including relevant practical skills, and constitutes 35% of the A Level. Paper 2 covers topics 5–8, also including practical skills, and represents 35% of the qualification. Paper 3 assesses topics 1–8 with a particular focus on experimental methods, analysis, and evaluation, contributing 30% to the final grade. All papers include a mixture of short and long answer questions, plus extended response questions that test students' ability to synthesise knowledge across the specification.

Mathematical skills are embedded throughout the AQA Biology specification. Students are expected to demonstrate competence in areas including arithmetic and numerical computation, handling data, algebra, graphs, and geometry. Approximately 10% of the assessment tests mathematical skills at Level 2 or above. This emphasis reflects the increasing quantitative nature of modern biology and prepares students for university-level study.

### AQA A Level Chemistry (7404/7405)

AQA's A Level Chemistry specification is structured around physical, inorganic, and organic chemistry, with integrated practical skills development. The AS specification (7404) covers fundamental concepts including atomic structure, amount of substance, bonding, energetics, kinetics, equilibrium, redox, and introductory organic chemistry. The full A Level (7405) builds substantially on this foundation, adding thermodynamics, rate equations, electrode potentials, acids and bases, transition metals, and extended organic chemistry including aromatic compounds, amines, polymers, amino acids, and organic synthesis.

Assessment follows the same three-paper structure as Biology. Paper 1 examines physical and inorganic chemistry (topics 1–4 and 6–11), contributing 35% of the A Level. Paper 2 tests organic chemistry (topics 3, 5, and 12–15), also worth 35%. Paper 3 covers all topics with emphasis on practical techniques, data analysis, and synoptic understanding, representing 30% of the qualification. Paper 3 includes multiple-choice questions, short answers, and extended writing tasks that require students to draw connections across the specification.

Mathematical demand in AQA Chemistry is higher than in Biology, with approximately 20% of the assessment testing mathematical skills at Level 2 or above. Students must demonstrate proficiency in calculations involving moles, concentration, gas volumes, energy changes, rates, and equilibrium constants. The specification also requires understanding of logarithmic relationships for pH calculations and graphical analysis of kinetic and equilibrium data.

### AQA A Level Physics (7407/7408)

AQA's A Level Physics specification covers mechanics, materials, waves, electricity, thermal physics, fields, nuclear physics, and options including astrophysics, medical physics, engineering physics, turning points in physics, or electronics. The AS specification (7407) includes measurements and their errors, particles and radiation, waves, mechanics and materials, and electricity. The full A Level (7408) extends coverage to further mechanics and thermal physics, fields and their consequences, and nuclear physics, plus the optional unit.

The three written papers assess different aspects of the specification. Paper 1 covers topics 1–5 and 6.1 (periodic motion), including relevant practical skills, constituting 34% of the A Level. Paper 2 examines topics 6.2, 7–13, with practical skills, also worth 34%. Paper 3 tests topics 1–13 with particular emphasis on practical techniques, data analysis, and the optional topic, contributing 32% to the final grade. Paper 3 includes multiple-choice questions, short answers, and extended writing tasks.

Mathematical requirements in AQA Physics are the most demanding of the three sciences, with approximately 40% of the assessment testing mathematical skills. Students must demonstrate competence in arithmetic, algebra, graphical work, geometry, and trigonometry. The specification requires confident use of calculus concepts including differentiation and integration, though formal calculus manipulation is not assessed. Students must also understand and apply logarithmic relationships, particularly for radioactive decay and capacitor discharge.

## OCR A Level Specifications

### OCR A Level Biology A (H020/H420)

OCR offers two Biology specifications: Biology A (content-led) and Biology B (context-led). Biology A (H020/H420) is structured around biological concepts taught in discrete topics. The specification is divided into six teaching modules: development of practical skills, foundations in biology, exchange and transport, biodiversity, evolution and disease, communication, homeostasis and energy, and genetics, evolution and ecosystems.

The assessment structure for OCR Biology A differs slightly from AQA. Paper 1 assesses content from modules 1, 2, 3, and 5, contributing 37% of the A Level. Paper 2 examines modules 1, 2, 4, and 6, also worth 37%. Paper 3 covers all modules with particular emphasis on practical skills, data analysis, and synoptic assessment, representing 26% of the qualification. All papers include structured questions, short answer questions, and extended response questions.

OCR's Practical Endorsement follows the same JCQ Common Practical Assessment Criteria as other awarding bodies. Students must demonstrate competence across five CPAC areas through a programme of practical work that includes 12 required practicals. These practicals cover techniques including microscopy, dissection, microbiology, biochemical testing, and ecological sampling. OCR provides comprehensive practical handbooks and teacher guidance to support implementation.

### OCR A Level Chemistry A (H032/H432)

OCR Chemistry A (H032/H432) takes a content-led approach, dividing the specification into discrete topics covering key chemical concepts. The structure comprises six teaching modules: development of practical skills, foundations in chemistry, periodic table and energy, core organic chemistry, physical chemistry and transition elements, and organic chemistry and analysis.

Assessment follows the same pattern as OCR Biology. Paper 1 examines practical skills, foundations in chemistry, and the periodic table and energy module, contributing 37% of the A Level. Paper 2 tests practical skills, foundations, and core organic chemistry, worth 37%. Paper 3 covers all content with emphasis on practical techniques, physical chemistry, organic chemistry, and synoptic understanding, representing 26% of the qualification.

A distinctive feature of OCR Chemistry is the explicit integration of practical skills throughout the specification content. Module 1 (Development of Practical Skills) is not assessed separately but provides the foundation for practical work that supports understanding of theoretical concepts. The 12 required practicals are distributed across the specification, with each module including specific practical activities that develop both techniques and conceptual understanding.

### OCR A Level Physics A (H156/H556)

OCR Physics A (H156/H556) is structured around six teaching modules: development of practical skills, foundations of physics, forces and motion, electrons, waves and photons, Newtonian world and astrophysics, and particles and medical physics. This structure allows for coherent progression from foundational concepts through to advanced applications.

Assessment comprises three papers following the OCR science model. Paper 1 assesses modules 1, 2, 3, and 5, contributing 37% of the A Level. Paper 2 examines modules 1, 2, 4, and 6, worth 37%. Paper 3 covers all modules with emphasis on practical skills, data analysis, and synoptic assessment, representing 26% of the qualification. Paper 3 includes a significant section devoted to practical techniques and data analysis.

OCR Physics A places particular emphasis on the development of practical skills through a structured programme of activities. The 12 required practicals cover techniques including measurement and uncertainty, oscillations, electrical circuits, optics, and radioactivity. OCR provides detailed guidance on practical work, including apparatus lists, method sheets, and assessment criteria that align with the CPAC requirements.

## Pearson Edexcel A Level Specifications

### Pearson Edexcel A Level Biology B (9BI0)

Pearson Edexcel offers two Biology specifications: Biology A (Salters-Nuffield) and Biology B. The Biology B specification (9BI0) is structured around core biological concepts with applications to contemporary contexts. The content is organised into eight topic areas: lifestyle, health and risk, genes and health, voice of the genome, biodiversity and natural resources, immunity, infection and forensics, and optional topics.

The assessment structure comprises three externally examined papers. Paper 1 covers topics 1–4 and examines scientific methodology and core concepts, contributing 33.33% of the A Level. Paper 2 assesses topics 5–7 plus scientific methodology and additional concepts, worth 33.33%. Paper 3 tests all topics with emphasis on scientific methodology, data analysis, and the optional topic, representing 33.33% of the qualification. Paper 3 includes a pre-release scientific article that students study in advance of the examination.

Edexcel's approach to practical skills emphasises the integration of practical work with conceptual understanding. The 16 core practicals (compared to 12 in other specifications) cover techniques including microscopy, biochemical testing, microbiology, and ecological investigation. These practicals provide the basis for the Practical Endorsement while also developing understanding of biological concepts.

### Pearson Edexcel A Level Chemistry (9CH0)

Pearson Edexcel A Level Chemistry (9CH0) is structured around five topic areas: atoms, formulae, equations and amount of substance, energetics and equilibria, organic chemistry, and inorganic chemistry and the periodic table. The specification emphasises the development of chemical literacy alongside practical skills and conceptual understanding.

Assessment follows the standard three-paper model. Paper 1 examines advanced inorganic and physical chemistry, contributing 30% of the A Level. Paper 2 tests advanced organic and physical chemistry, worth 30%. Paper 3 covers all content with emphasis on practical techniques, data analysis, and general and practical principles, representing 40% of the qualification. Paper 3 is synoptic in nature and includes questions that draw on understanding from across the specification.

Edexcel Chemistry includes 16 core practicals that students must complete as part of their Practical Endorsement. These practicals cover techniques including titration, calorimetry, qualitative analysis, organic preparation, and instrumental methods. The specification emphasises the development of practical competence alongside understanding of chemical principles, with practical skills assessed throughout the written papers.

### Pearson Edexcel A Level Physics (9PH0)

Pearson Edexcel A Level Physics (9PH0) is structured around six topic areas: mechanics, materials, waves, electricity, thermodynamics, and modern physics. The specification emphasises the development of physics problem-solving skills alongside conceptual understanding and practical competence.

The assessment structure comprises three written papers. Paper 1 covers advanced mechanics, contributing 30% of the A Level. Paper 2 examines advanced physics including waves, electricity, and thermodynamics, worth 30%. Paper 3 tests all content with emphasis on practical techniques, data analysis, and general and practical principles, representing 40% of the qualification. Paper 3 includes synoptic questions that require students to apply knowledge and skills from across the specification.

Edexcel Physics requires students to complete 16 core practicals as part of their Practical Endorsement. These practicals cover techniques including measurement and uncertainty, motion, forces, waves, circuits, and radioactivity. The specification places particular emphasis on the analysis and evaluation of experimental data, with students expected to understand concepts including measurement uncertainty, error propagation, and graphical analysis.

## The Practical Endorsement

### Purpose and Structure

The Practical Endorsement is a compulsory component of all A Level science qualifications in England, though it is reported separately from the A Level grade as Pass or Not Classified. Introduced as part of the 2015 A Level reforms, the Practical Endorsement replaced the previous system of assessed coursework and practical examinations. Its purpose is to ensure that all A Level science students experience a coherent programme of practical work that develops essential laboratory skills.

The Practical Endorsement is not graded and does not contribute to the A Level grade. However, universities and employers often require a Pass in the Practical Endorsement for science-related courses and careers. The separate reporting reflects a policy decision to encourage schools to prioritise practical skill development without the pressure of high-stakes assessment, though critics argue that this has led to reduced emphasis on practical work in some schools.

Students must complete a programme of practical work that includes 12 (AQA, OCR) or 16 (Edexcel) required practicals. These practicals are prescribed by the awarding bodies and cover the full range of techniques and apparatus specified in the subject criteria. Beyond the required practicals, students should engage in additional practical activities that develop broader practical competence and support conceptual understanding.

### Common Practical Assessment Criteria (CPAC)

Assessment of the Practical Endorsement is based on the Common Practical Assessment Criteria (CPAC), established by the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) on behalf of all awarding bodies. The CPAC define five competencies that students must demonstrate consistently to achieve a Pass:

**CPAC 1** requires students to follow written procedures correctly. This includes following instructions for practical work, working safely, and using apparatus appropriately. Students must demonstrate the ability to follow complex multi-step procedures and to adapt when instructions require interpretation or adjustment.

**CPAC 2** requires students to apply investigative approaches and methods when using instruments and equipment. This involves selecting appropriate apparatus and techniques, setting up equipment correctly, and using instruments with appropriate precision. Students must demonstrate understanding of why particular methods are appropriate and how to modify approaches when necessary.

**CPAC 3** requires students to safely use a range of practical equipment and materials. This includes identifying hazards and risks, taking appropriate precautions, and working in ways that minimise risk to themselves and others. Students must demonstrate understanding of standard laboratory safety procedures and specific precautions relevant to particular activities.

**CPAC 4** requires students to make and record observations appropriately. This involves making accurate observations using the senses or instruments, recording observations clearly and systematically, and using appropriate units and significant figures. Students must demonstrate understanding of measurement uncertainty and the distinction between qualitative and quantitative observations.

**CPAC 5** requires students to research, reference, and report findings. This includes processing and analysing data, drawing valid conclusions, evaluating methods and results, and communicating findings using appropriate scientific conventions. Students must demonstrate the ability to interpret data, identify patterns and anomalies, and suggest improvements to investigative procedures.

### Monitoring and Quality Assurance

The Practical Endorsement is monitored through a system of visits conducted by awarding body representatives. Each centre is visited at least once during the first two years of teaching a reformed A Level specification. The monitoring visit assesses whether the centre is providing appropriate opportunities for practical work and whether assessment against the CPAC is being conducted consistently and accurately.

During the monitoring visit, the awarding body representative reviews records of practical work, discusses the programme with teachers, and may observe practical activities. The visit provides an opportunity for professional dialogue about practical work and assessment, and for sharing of good practice. Centres that are judged to be implementing the Practical Endorsement appropriately receive confirmation of their status. Where concerns are identified, additional support and follow-up visits may be arranged.

Centres must maintain records of students' practical work and CPAC assessments throughout the course. These records should demonstrate that students have had opportunities to develop and demonstrate each CPAC competency across a range of practical activities. While the Practical Endorsement is assessed holistically rather than through individual practical assessments, centres should be able to provide evidence that each student has met the requirements consistently.

### Cross-Board Compatibility

A distinctive feature of the Practical Endorsement system is the transferability of the endorsement between awarding bodies. A student who completes practical work and achieves a Pass with one awarding body can transfer this to another awarding body if they change specification or if their centre switches awarding bodies. This transferability is managed through the JCQ and requires appropriate documentation and verification.

The practical skills developed through the endorsement are broadly equivalent across awarding bodies, reflecting the common CPAC framework and similar requirements for practical techniques. However, the specific practical activities differ between specifications, with Edexcel requiring 16 core practicals compared to 12 for AQA and OCR. Students transferring between specifications may need to complete additional practical work to meet the specific requirements of their new specification.

## Non-Exam Assessment (NEA)

### Scope and Requirements

Non-exam assessment (NEA) in A Level science is limited to the Practical Endorsement, which is assessed through teacher observation rather than through written submission or examination. Unlike previous A Level specifications, which included assessed coursework contributing to the final grade, the reformed specifications contain no additional NEA components. This represents a significant reduction in non-examined assessment compared to legacy specifications.

The removal of coursework from A Level science was a deliberate policy decision intended to address concerns about authenticity, plagiarism, and inconsistent marking. Ofqual concluded that practical skills could be better assessed through a combination of the Practical Endorsement (assessing competence) and written examination questions (assessing understanding of practical methods and data analysis). This approach prioritises reliability and comparability over the assessment of extended investigative projects.

### Practical Skills in Written Examinations

While the Practical Endorsement assesses practical competence through observation, written examinations test students' understanding of practical methods, data analysis, and scientific reasoning. All three A Level science specifications include examination questions that require students to analyse experimental data, evaluate methods, suggest improvements
