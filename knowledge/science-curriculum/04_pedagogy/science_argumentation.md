# Science Talk and Argumentation

## Introduction

Scientific argumentation—the process of articulating, defending, and refining claims based on evidence—lies at the heart of authentic science education. Unlike the traditional view of science as a body of established facts, contemporary science education recognises that science is fundamentally a social enterprise where knowledge is constructed through discourse, critique, and consensus-building. Jonathan Osborne and his colleagues have argued persuasively that **the current science curricula are failing to educate students to be competent outsiders to science**, in part because they neglect the essential skill of constructing and evaluating arguments.

This knowledge file explores the theoretical foundations and practical approaches for developing science talk and argumentation in primary and secondary classrooms. It examines Stephen Toulmin's influential model of argumentation, the Claim-Evidence-Reasoning (CER) framework adapted for classroom use, dialogic teaching approaches developed by Neil Mercer and Lyn Dawes, and Structured Academic Controversy as a cooperative learning strategy. Together, these approaches provide teachers with a comprehensive toolkit for transforming science classrooms into communities of inquiry where students learn to think and talk like scientists.

## Why Argumentation Matters in Science Education

### The Nature of Scientific Knowledge

Science is not merely a collection of facts but a way of knowing characterised by specific epistemic practices. At its core, science involves proposing explanations, testing them against evidence, and subjecting them to peer critique. As Duschl and Grandy (2007) observe, **"the language of science is a discourse that critically examines and evaluates the numerous and at times iterative transformations of evidence into explanations."** Without opportunities to engage in these practices, students cannot develop genuine scientific literacy.

Research conducted by Osborne et al. (2004) found that **classroom discourse in secondary science classrooms was largely teacher-dominated and tended not to foster the reflective discussion of scientific issues**. Their study examined whether secondary science teachers in England gave pupils opportunities to develop and rehearse the skills of argumentation during lessons. The findings were sobering: opportunities for the social construction of knowledge, afforded by argument-based pedagogical techniques, were few and far between. Similar patterns have been observed in primary classrooms, where the emphasis on "right answers" often suppresses genuine exploratory talk.

### Developing Scientific Literacy

The goal of science education extends beyond preparing future scientists. As citizens, students must be able to evaluate scientific claims in media, policy debates, and everyday life. This requires what Norris and Phillips (2003) call **"fundamental scientific literacy"**—the ability to understand the epistemological basis of scientific claims. Argumentation provides the bridge between learning science content and developing the critical reasoning capacities necessary for informed citizenship.

In an age of misinformation, the ability to distinguish evidence-based claims from unsubstantiated assertions has become increasingly urgent. Osborne (2023) argues that science education must equip students to navigate contested scientific territory, from climate change to vaccine safety. Without explicit instruction in evaluating arguments, students may default to heuristic reasoning or authority-based acceptance, neither of which serves them well when experts disagree or evidence is ambiguous.

### Cognitive and Social Benefits

Beyond developing scientific literacy, argumentation offers significant cognitive benefits. Research by Kuhn (1993) and others has demonstrated that engaging in argumentation develops metacognitive awareness, as students must monitor their own reasoning and identify gaps or inconsistencies. The process of constructing arguments also deepens content understanding, as students must elaborate connections between claims and evidence rather than memorising isolated facts.

Socially, argumentation fosters collaboration and perspective-taking. When students engage in productive argumentation, they learn to disagree respectfully, consider alternative viewpoints, and revise their thinking based on new evidence. These skills transfer beyond the science classroom, supporting students' development as thoughtful participants in democratic society.

## Toulmin's Model of Argumentation

### Origins and Structure

In his seminal 1958 work *The Uses of Argument*, philosopher **Stephen Toulmin** proposed a model for analysing arguments that has profoundly influenced science education. Toulmin sought to develop a more flexible and realistic alternative to formal logic for understanding everyday reasoning. His model identifies six interconnected elements:

#### 1. Claim
The **claim** is the assertion being made—the conclusion that the arguer wants the audience to accept. In science classrooms, claims might include statements like "plants need light to grow" or "friction is a non-contact force." Claims can be descriptive (stating what is), causal (explaining why something happens), or prescriptive (recommending what should be done).

#### 2. Data (or Grounds/Evidence)
**Data** consists of the facts, observations, or evidence that support the claim. In scientific argumentation, data might include experimental measurements, observational records, or findings from established research. Toulmin emphasised that claims must be grounded in data—unsubstantiated assertions do not constitute arguments.

#### 3. Warrant
The **warrant** provides the logical connection between data and claim. It answers the question: **"Why does this data support this claim?"** Warrants are often general principles, rules, or assumptions that license the inference from evidence to conclusion. In science, warrants frequently draw on scientific theories, established laws, or methodological principles.

#### 4. Backing
**Backing** provides support for the warrant itself, answering "Why should we accept this warrant?" When warrants are uncontroversial, backing may be implicit. However, when warrants are challenged, arguers must provide additional justification.

#### 5. Qualifier
**Qualifiers** indicate the strength or certainty of the claim. Words like "probably," "usually," "necessarily," or "presumably" signal the degree of confidence the arguer has in the conclusion.

#### 6. Rebuttal
**Rebuttals** specify conditions under which the claim would not hold. Anticipating counterarguments and exceptions strengthens scientific reasoning.

### From Toulmin to CER

The Claim-Evidence-Reasoning (CER) framework maps to Toulmin's model:
- **Claim** = Toulmin's claim
- **Evidence** = Toulmin's data
- **Reasoning** = Toulmin's warrant (often including backing)

This simplified structure makes Toulmin's insights accessible to younger students while preserving the essential insight that claims must be connected to evidence through logical reasoning.

## Claim-Evidence-Reasoning (CER) Framework

### Structure and Purpose

The **Claim-Evidence-Reasoning (CER)** framework provides a scaffold for helping students construct scientific arguments:

**Claim**: A declarative statement that answers the question or problem under investigation.

**Evidence**: The scientific data that supports the claim.

**Reasoning**: The explanation of why the evidence supports the claim, connecting specific evidence to broader claims through scientific principles.

### Teaching CER Effectively

Introducing CER requires explicit instruction and repeated practice. Teachers should begin with concrete, non-science contexts before applying it to scientific content. As students develop proficiency, teachers should gradually remove scaffolding.

Common pitfalls include restating evidence as reasoning, insufficient evidence, and missing or weak reasoning.

### Progression in CER Use

**Primary Phase (KS1-KS2)**: CER serves as a thinking tool. Young children make simple claims and begin to distinguish observations from conclusions. The focus is on developing the habit of supporting claims with reasons.

**Secondary Phase (KS3-KS4)**: Students develop sophistication in distinguishing qualitative and quantitative evidence, using multiple evidence sources, referencing scientific concepts, and acknowledging limitations.

## Dialogic Teaching and Science Talk

### Theoretical Foundations

**Dialogic teaching**, developed by Neil Mercer and colleagues, emphasises the role of dialogue in learning. Mercer distinguishes three types of classroom talk:

**Disputational Talk**: Characterised by disagreement without listening.

**Cumulative Talk**: Building positively but uncritically on others' ideas.

**Exploratory Talk**: Critical engagement with ideas through questioning and elaboration—the gold standard for learning.

### The Thinking Together Programme

The **Thinking Together** programme establishes ground rules for productive dialogue: everyone contributes, everyone listens, all ideas are respected, reasons are given, alternatives are considered, and groups seek agreement.

### Dialogic Teaching in Practice

Key strategies include reducing teacher dominance through less IRE pattern questioning, using open questions, providing wait time, and regularly recapping and synthesising contributions.

## Talk Moves: Scaffolding Productive Discourse

**Talk moves** are specific prompts teachers use to facilitate science talk. Developed by Michaels and O'Connor, they include:

**Moves to Help Students Share Thinking**
- Revoicing (repeating and verifying)
- Restating (asking others to paraphrase)
- Prompting for further participation

**Moves to Help Students Listen and Respond**
- Asking students to apply reasoning to others' reasoning
- Prompting for evidence
- Prompting for reasoning

**Moves to Deepen Reasoning**
- Wait time
- Asking students to say more
- Using precise scientific language

## Structured Academic Controversy

### Overview

**Structured Academic Controversy (SAC)** is a cooperative learning strategy for teaching controversial topics through guided student dialogue. Unlike traditional debate where winning is the goal, SAC requires students to argue for both sides of an issue and ultimately develop a balanced, evidence-based position.

### The SAC Process

1. **Introduction**: Present the controversial issue without taking sides.
2. **Position Assignment**: Divide students into groups of four, with pairs assigned to each side.
3. **Position Development**: Pairs research and develop the strongest possible argument for their assigned position.
4. **Argument Presentation**: Each pair presents their position while the opposing pair listens and takes notes.
5. **Open Discussion**: Students discuss the issue, asking clarifying questions and identifying points of agreement and disagreement.
6. **Position Reversal**: Pairs switch sides and present the opposing argument.
7. **Synthesis**: Working together, all four students develop a consensus position that synthesises the strongest arguments from both sides.

### Why SAC Works for Science

SAC addresses genuine controversies in science—historical debates (continental drift vs. fixed continents), current uncertainties (optimal approaches to climate mitigation), and ethical dilemmas (genetic engineering). By requiring students to argue both sides, SAC develops intellectual humility and appreciation for the role of evidence in resolving disputes.

Research indicates SAC is **one means of teaching evolutionary theory while maintaining a constructivist approach**, allowing students to engage with controversial content without feeling their personal beliefs are under attack. The structure ensures that the goal is understanding different perspectives rather than winning an argument.

## Progression in Argumentation Skills

### Early Years and Key Stage 1

Young children are capable of simple argumentation when provided appropriate contexts. At this stage, focus on:
- Making observations and distinguishing them from conclusions
- Providing simple reasons for ideas ("I think X because Y")
- Listening to and acknowledging others' ideas
- Participating in collaborative discussions about "why" questions

Activities that generate clear cause-effect relationships (shadows, plant growth, material properties) provide accessible entry points.

### Key Stage 2

Upper primary students can engage with more structured argumentation:
- Distinguishing between evidence and opinion
- Using simple evidence to support claims
- Recognising that different conclusions may be drawn from the same evidence
- Beginning to evaluate the strength of simple arguments

CER can be introduced as an organisational structure, though the emphasis should remain on oral argumentation.

### Key Stage 3

Secondary students should develop increasing autonomy in argumentation:
- Constructing multi-step arguments
- Evaluating evidence quality
- Identifying assumptions and warrants
- Engaging with genuinely uncertain or controversial topics
- Using technical vocabulary appropriately

### Key Stage 4 and Beyond

By GCSE, students should be able to:
- Construct extended written arguments
- Evaluate competing explanations systematically
- Identify logical fallacies and weak reasoning
- Engage with authentic scientific controversies
- Recognise the tentativeness of scientific conclusions

## Assessment of Argumentation

### What to Assess

Assessment of argumentation should focus on:
- **Structure**: Does the argument include appropriate components (claim, evidence, reasoning)?
- **Content**: Is the science accurate? Is evidence relevant and sufficient?
- **Reasoning**: Is the connection between evidence and claim logically sound?
- **Counter-argumentation**: Are alternative explanations considered?
- **Quality of engagement**: In oral contexts, do students build on others' ideas?

### Assessment Tools

**Analytic Rubrics**: Detailed criteria for each component of argumentation, allowing specific feedback.

**Holistic Scoring**: Overall judgement of argument quality, useful for summative assessment.

**Argumentation Schemes**: Frameworks like Toulmin's model used to code and analyse the structure of student arguments.

**Self and Peer Assessment**: Students evaluating their own and others' arguments develops metacognitive awareness.

### Challenges in Assessment

Assessing argumentation presents challenges:
- **Subjectivity**: Judgements about argument quality involve interpretation
- **Content-dependency**: Strong argumentation in one domain does not guarantee transfer
- **Oral vs. written**: Oral argumentation captures thinking-in-progress but is harder to assess; written arguments allow reflection but may underrepresent capability

Rubrics should be shared with students and used formatively to develop capacity, not just summatively to judge performance.

## Practical Implementation Guidance

### Getting Started

For teachers new to argumentation, start small:
1. Choose one approach (CER, talk moves, or SAC) to implement initially
2. Begin with highly structured, low-stakes activities
3. Select topics where evidence supports clear conclusions
4. Model the process explicitly
5. Provide ample practice opportunities

### Creating a Supportive Culture

Argumentation requires psychological safety. Students must feel comfortable expressing tentative ideas, acknowledging uncertainty, and changing their minds. Establish norms such as:
- All ideas deserve respectful consideration
- Questions indicate engagement, not ignorance
- Revising thinking based on evidence is scientific strength
- Disagreement focuses on ideas, not people

### Integrating with Curriculum

Argumentation should not be an add-on but integrated into regular instruction:
- Frame investigation questions to invite argumentation
- Use predict-observe-explain sequences that require reasoning
- Include "what if" and "how do you know" questions routinely
- Select reading materials that present multiple perspectives

### Common Challenges and Responses

**"Students don't have enough knowledge to argue"**
Response: Begin with topics where students have experiential knowledge. Argumentation develops understanding; it need not wait for mastery.

**"It takes too much time"**
Response: Start with brief argumentation activities. The depth of understanding developed saves time on reteaching.

**"Students just want the right answer"**
Response: Explicitly teach that science involves uncertainty. Celebrate good reasoning even when conclusions differ.

**"Some students dominate while others are silent"**
Response: Use structures (think-pair-share, small groups, written preparation) that ensure broad participation.

## Conclusion

Science talk and argumentation transform classrooms from places where students receive information into communities where they construct understanding. Toulmin's model provides analytical rigour for examining arguments. The CER framework offers accessible scaffolding. Dialogic teaching and talk moves create conditions for productive discourse. Structured Academic Controversy engages students with genuine scientific debate.

Together, these approaches develop the scientific literacy students need as citizens and the reasoning skills that support learning across the curriculum. The research is clear: classrooms where argumentation is routine produce deeper understanding, better retention, and more engaged learners. The task for teachers is to create the conditions where scientific talk can flourish.
