# Practical Work Design in Science Education

## Introduction

Practical work lies at the heart of science education, representing the distinctive pedagogical approach that separates science from other subjects. However, as Abrahams and Millar (2008) demonstrated in their seminal research, practical work is only effective when it is intentionally designed to connect the domain of observables (what students see and do) with the domain of ideas (the scientific concepts being taught). The Gatsby Charitable Foundation's "Good Practical Science" report (Holman, 2017) established ten benchmarks for world-class practical science, emphasising that practical work must serve clear educational purposes beyond mere engagement or demonstration.

This knowledge base explores the theoretical foundations, typologies, cognitive challenges, and safety frameworks that underpin effective practical work design across primary and secondary science education. It synthesises research from the Association for Science Education (ASE), the Royal Society of Chemistry, Ofsted's subject reports, and contemporary cognitive science to provide actionable guidance for curriculum leaders and classroom practitioners.

## Types of Practical Work

### The Five Purposes Framework

The Gatsby Good Practical Science report identifies five distinct purposes of practical work, each requiring different design considerations:

#### 1. Illustrative Practical Work

Illustrative practicals are designed to help students visualise abstract concepts or phenomena that cannot be directly observed. These activities bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and concrete experience. For example, using coloured dyes to represent blood flow through a model circulatory system, or employing atomic models to represent molecular structures that exceed the limits of direct observation.

Design considerations for illustrative practicals include:
- Ensuring the model accurately represents the scientific phenomenon without introducing misconceptions
- Explicitly discussing the limitations of the model with students
- Connecting the illustration back to the underlying scientific concept
- Using the activity as a platform for questioning rather than mere demonstration

#### 2. Investigative Practical Work

Investigative practicals engage students in the processes of scientific enquiry, including hypothesis formation, variable identification, data collection, analysis, and conclusion drawing. These activities develop working scientifically skills alongside substantive knowledge. The Gatsby benchmarks emphasise that students should experience both closed (structured) and open-ended investigations throughout their science education.

Key characteristics of well-designed investigative work:
- Clear identification of independent, dependent, and control variables
- Opportunities for students to make predictions based on prior knowledge
- Authentic data collection that produces meaningful patterns
- Analysis requirements that demand interpretation beyond simple description
- Evaluation components that address reliability, validity, and error identification

Research by the ASE (2022) indicates that investigative work is most effective when teachers explicitly teach the enquiry process alongside scientific content, rather than assuming students will implicitly acquire these skills through repeated exposure.

#### 3. Enquiry-Based Practical Work

Enquiry-based practicals position students as active questioners and explorers, often beginning with student-generated questions rather than teacher-prescribed procedures. While overlapping with investigative work, enquiry-based practicals place greater emphasis on student agency in determining the direction of exploration.

The Ofsted science subject report "Finding the Optimum" (2023) notes that effective enquiry work in early years and primary settings occurs "when teachers are clear about its purpose, when children have regular opportunities to talk with adults, and when teachers complement children's choices to ensure a full curriculum." This principle extends through all key stages—enquiry must be purposeful rather than merely engaging.

#### 4. Skill-Building Practical Work

Certain practical activities focus primarily on developing manipulative and procedural skills that students require for more complex investigations. These include techniques such as microscopy, titration, electrical circuit construction, and safe handling of equipment.

The ASE's Keeping Science Practical Programme (2025) emphasises that technicians play a vital role in supporting skill-building practicals, with their expertise in equipment setup and troubleshooting enabling teachers to focus on pedagogy. However, the Programme also reports concerning statistics: a 159% increase in technicians citing high levels of stress and exhaustion, and 30% of UK technicians receiving no role-specific CPD in the last academic year.

#### 5. Demonstrations

Teacher demonstrations, while not hands-on for students, remain a legitimate and valuable form of practical work when appropriately employed. Demonstrations are particularly effective for:
- Activities involving significant safety risks when conducted by novices
- Procedures requiring equipment beyond student access
- Phenomena where teacher narration and questioning can guide attention
- Consolidating learning through memorable visual experiences

The key consideration is whether the demonstration serves a clear learning purpose that could not be achieved through student practical work. Ofsted (2023) observed that effective science teaching balances demonstrations with hands-on experiences across the curriculum.

### The Domain of Observables and the Domain of Ideas

Millar and Abrahams (2008) proposed a critical framework for practical work design based on two domains:

**The Domain of Observables** encompasses everything students can directly perceive during a practical activity: the equipment, the procedures, the phenomena, and the measurements. This domain is inherently concrete and experiential.

**The Domain of Ideas** comprises the scientific concepts, models, and theories that explain observables. This domain is abstract and requires intellectual engagement to access.

Effective practical work, according to this framework, must deliberately bridge these domains. Students must understand how what they observe relates to the scientific ideas being taught. Abrahams and Millar's research found that many practical lessons fail to achieve this connection—students successfully complete hands-on activities without developing corresponding conceptual understanding. This disconnect represents what they term "hands-on without minds-on" learning.

## Purpose and Pedagogical Design

### Clarifying Learning Objectives

The ASE's School Science Review (2022) suggests that practical work requires "greater clarity about the learning objectives of practical activities, and wider use of strategies to increase the 'minds on' aspects of practical work." Before designing any practical activity, teachers should articulate:

1. **The substantive knowledge** students should acquire or consolidate
2. **The disciplinary knowledge** (working scientifically skills) being developed
3. **The specific connection** between observables and ideas that the practical is designed to establish
4. **The prerequisite knowledge** students must possess to engage productively

This clarity enables more effective sequencing of instruction. Millar (2004) proposes that students' minds should be stimulated prior to starting practical work through pre-laboratory activities that establish the conceptual context for observation.

### The Role of Prediction

Research consistently demonstrates that requiring students to make predictions before conducting practical work significantly enhances learning outcomes. Predictions force students to activate prior knowledge and commit to a position, creating cognitive dissonance when results contradict expectations. This dissonance drives attention to the phenomenon and motivates sense-making.

Effective prediction strategies include:
- **Individual prediction** before group discussion, ensuring all students engage intellectually
- **Written predictions** that can be referenced after the practical
- **Diagrammatic predictions** for phenomena where visual representation aids understanding
- **Prediction justification** requiring students to explain their reasoning, making underlying models explicit

### Teacher Questioning and Dialogue

The discourse surrounding practical work is as important as the activity itself. Ofsted (2023) emphasises that "teacher talk often dominates the lesson" in ways that limit student thinking. Effective practical pedagogy employs strategic questioning to:

- **Focus attention** on relevant aspects of the phenomenon
- **Probe understanding** of the relationship between observations and concepts
- **Challenge misconceptions** revealed by student interpretations
- **Extend thinking** by connecting the practical to broader scientific principles
- **Encourage evaluation** of the activity's reliability and limitations

The Education Endowment Foundation's Improving Primary Science guidance (2023) recommends structured talk for learning approaches, ensuring that practical work generates productive student-to-student and student-to-teacher dialogue rather than mere procedural compliance.

### Recording and Reporting

How students record practical work influences what they learn from it. Traditional approaches requiring comprehensive write-ups of every practical can consume excessive curriculum time and focus student attention on presentational compliance rather than conceptual engagement.

Alternative approaches include:
- **Key findings summaries** requiring students to distil essential conclusions
- **Diagrammatic representations** with explanatory annotations
- **Data presentation exercises** focusing on appropriate graph selection and interpretation
- **Evaluation-focused write-ups** requiring critical analysis of the activity's limitations
- **Digital recording** using video, photographs, or data-logging equipment to preserve phenomena for subsequent analysis

The Royal Society of Chemistry (2025) provides student risk assessment worksheets that guide learners in recognising hazards, evaluating risks, and identifying control measures—integrating safety education into the practical process rather than treating it as peripheral paperwork.

## Cognitive Challenge and Minds-On Learning

### Cognitive Load Considerations

Contemporary cognitive science provides important insights for practical work design. When students engage with practical activities, they must simultaneously manage:

- **Intrinsic cognitive load**: the complexity of the scientific concepts being learned
- **Extraneous cognitive load**: the demands of equipment manipulation, procedure following, and recording
- **Germane cognitive load**: the productive mental effort of connecting observations to concepts

Abrahams and Millar's research (2008) demonstrated that excessive extraneous load from complex procedures can leave insufficient working memory capacity for germane processing. This explains why students can successfully complete sophisticated practical procedures while learning little science from the experience.

### Mitigating Extraneous Load

Strategies for reducing extraneous cognitive load include:

**Pre-practical preparation**: Ensuring students are familiar with equipment and procedures before the lesson reduces the attentional demands of practical execution. This might include:
- Virtual simulations of complex procedures
- Equipment familiarisation sessions
- Simplified preliminary practicals focusing on technique

**Structured worksheets**: Well-designed practical worksheets can scaffold student thinking without over-prescription. Effective worksheets:
- Provide clear procedural guidance to minimise cognitive resources devoted to "what do I do next?"
- Include targeted questions that direct attention to relevant observations
- Require explicit connections between observations and concepts
- Limit presentational demands that distract from scientific thinking

**Equipment simplification**: Where possible, reducing the mechanical complexity of apparatus allows greater cognitive resources for conceptual engagement. This might involve:
- Pre-prepared equipment setups
- Digital data-logging to automate measurement
- Collaborative group structures where different students manage different aspects

### The Thinking-Back-and-Forth Approach

Recent research on "thinking-back-and-forth" in practical work (2023) identifies three critical characteristics of effective practice:

1. **Explicit instruction on minds-on learning**: Teachers must explicitly teach students how to engage intellectually with practical activities, not merely procedurally.

2. **Congruent pedagogy**: The teaching approach must consistently connect hands-on experiences to minds-on learning throughout the lesson, not merely at the conclusion.

3. **Cognitive load management**: Mitigating the demands of hands-on work is a prerequisite for minds-on engagement. Students cannot simultaneously struggle with procedure and attend to conceptual meaning.

The research concludes that "the appeal Abrahams and Millar (2008) made to give genuine attention to connecting the domain of observables to the domain of ideas during practical work is still pertinent."

### Progression in Cognitive Challenge

Cognitive challenge in practical work should progress systematically across key stages:

**Key Stage 1**: Practical work focuses on exploration, observation, and description. Students learn to use simple equipment safely and record findings through drawings and simple tables. The cognitive demand lies in linking observations to vocabulary and beginning to identify patterns.

**Key Stage 2**: Students begin to conduct fair tests with support, identifying variables and making predictions. Recording becomes more systematic, with greater emphasis on comparison and pattern recognition. The cognitive challenge involves understanding why controls are necessary and what constitutes evidence.

**Key Stage 3**: Independent investigation becomes possible, with students designing procedures, selecting appropriate equipment, and evaluating reliability. The cognitive demands of coordinating multiple variables and abstract scientific reasoning increase significantly.

**Key Stage 4**: Students should conduct full investigations with minimal scaffolding, including complex data analysis, error quantification, and critical evaluation of methodology. The cognitive challenge extends to understanding the epistemological basis of scientific knowledge—how we know what we know.

**Post-16**: The Gatsby benchmarks emphasise that sixth form students should experience open-ended and extended investigative projects that develop the independence and resilience required for scientific careers. These activities place substantial demands on self-regulation and sustained enquiry.

## Risk Assessment and Safety

### The Regulatory Framework

Practical science in UK schools operates within a comprehensive regulatory framework that balances educational benefit against potential hazards. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) recognises that "there will always be some element of risk when carrying out practical work in science," but emphasises that risk must be managed proportionately.

Key documents governing school science safety include:
- **CLEAPSS Hazcards**: Definitive guidance on chemical hazards, recognised by DfE, Ofsted, and HSE
- **CLEAPSS Recipe Sheets**: Standard procedures for common practical activities with integrated risk assessments
- **ASE Topics in Safety**: Guidance on specific safety issues in science education
- **DfE guidance** on health and safety in educational establishments

### The Risk Assessment Process

Effective risk assessment is a thinking process, not merely a paperwork exercise. CLEAPSS guidance (PS090) emphasises that risk assessment involves:

1. **Hazard identification**: Recognising what could cause harm (chemical, physical, biological, or environmental hazards)
2. **Risk evaluation**: Assessing the likelihood and severity of harm occurring
3. **Control measures**: Identifying actions to reduce risk to acceptable levels
4. **Recording**: Documenting the assessment for communication and review

The distinction between **hazard** (inherent potential to cause harm) and **risk** (likelihood of harm actually occurring) is fundamental. A concentrated acid is inherently hazardous, but the risk it presents depends on quantity, concentration, handling procedures, and the competence of those using it.

### Model Risk Assessments

Most practical activities in school science are well-established, and model risk assessments are available through CLEAPSS and ASE publications. These model assessments should be:

- **Reviewed** for relevance to specific school contexts
- **Adapted** for particular student groups (age, experience, additional needs)
- **Supplemented** with specific control measures for local conditions
- **Recorded** in the school's documentation system

The key principle is that schools should not duplicate assessments where authoritative guidance already exists, but must ensure that generic assessments are appropriately contextualised.

### Student Risk Assessment

Developing students' capacity to assess risk is itself a learning objective within science education. The Royal Society of Chemistry (2025) provides worksheets guiding students through:

- **Hazard recognition**: Identifying potential sources of harm in practical activities
- **Risk evaluation**: Considering who might be harmed and how
- **Control measure identification**: Determining appropriate precautions
- **Residual risk assessment**: Understanding that some risk always remains after controls are applied

This process develops both scientific understanding and transferable skills for responsible citizenship. Students who learn to assess laboratory risks systematically are better equipped to evaluate risks in everyday contexts.

### The Problem of Risk Aversion

The Gatsby Good Practical Science report identified "unnecessary risk aversion" as a significant barrier to effective practical science. When schools prohibit activities based on exaggerated risk assessments, students are denied valuable learning experiences. The benchmarks explicitly state that "students' experience of practical science should not be restricted by unnecessary risk aversion."

Ofsted's subject report (2023) found that in some schools, "access to practical work has been restricted due to concerns about safety or behaviour management." This restriction disproportionately affects disadvantaged students, who may have fewer opportunities for informal scientific exploration outside school.

Addressing unnecessary risk aversion requires:
- **Professional confidence** among teachers and technicians in conducting practical work
- **Appropriate CPD** on practical work management, not just safety procedures
- **Leadership support** for science departments maintaining practical provision
- **Technician workforce** adequate to support practical preparation and supervision
- **Culture of proportionality** in risk assessment that focuses on genuine hazards rather than theoretical possibilities

### Balanced Risk Management

STEM Learning's guidance on good practical science (2023) emphasises a "balanced approach to risk" that:
- Complies with legal requirements for health and safety
- Enables a wide range of practical experiences across all key stages
- Develops student understanding of risk assessment as a scientific process
- Maintains proportionality between precaution and educational benefit

CLEAPSS advice, contained in publications such as Hazcards, Practical Procedures, and Recipe Sheets, is recognised by DfE, Ofsted, and HSE as the definitive basis for safe practice in school science. Schools should not create additional burdensome procedures beyond this established guidance without specific justification.

## Assessment of Practical Skills

### GCSE Practical Endorsement

Current GCSE science qualifications include a practical endorsement that assesses students' competency in a range of practical techniques. While not contributing to the final grade (pass/fail only), the endorsement requires students to demonstrate proficiency across twelve required practical activities.

The practical endorsement assesses five competencies:
1. Follows written instructions
2. Applies investigative approaches and methods when using instruments and equipment
3. Safely uses a range of practical equipment and materials
4. Makes and records observations
5. Researches, references, and reports

### A-Level Practical Endorsement

A-level science practical endorsement operates similarly but with higher expectations for independence and sophistication. Students must demonstrate competence across twelve practical activities specified by the awarding organisations.

Ofsted (2023) noted concerns that the practical endorsement can become procedural and compliance-focused, with students "going through the motions" to complete requirements rather than engaging with the scientific thinking underlying practical work. Effective departments ensure that required practicals are integrated into coherent curriculum sequences rather than treated as isolated assessment exercises.

### Assessing Working Scientifically

Beyond the practical endorsement, effective assessment of practical skills includes:

- **Application questions** requiring students to apply investigative principles to novel contexts
- **Data analysis** tasks assessing interpretation and evaluation skills
- **Method evaluation** exercises requiring critical assessment of practical procedures
- **Experimental design** challenges testing independent planning capabilities

The Assessment and Qualifications Alliance (AQA) and other awarding organisations provide extensive guidance on assessing working scientifically, emphasising that practical skills should be developed and assessed throughout the course, not merely in formal practical activities.

## Integration with Curriculum Design

### Sequencing Practical Experiences

Practical work should be sequenced deliberately within curriculum planning, with progression in both substantive content and disciplinary skills. A well-designed curriculum ensures that:

- Students encounter practical work regularly across
