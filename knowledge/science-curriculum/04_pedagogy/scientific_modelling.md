# Scientific Modelling in Science Education

This knowledge base article explores the role of scientific models in teaching and learning science across all key stages. It examines how models function in scientific understanding, the progression of modelling skills from primary through secondary education, and specific applications of particle models and biological models in the classroom.

## The Role of Models in Science Education

### What is a Scientific Model?

A scientific model is a simplified representation of a phenomenon, system, or process that helps scientists and learners explain, predict, and understand aspects of the natural world. Models are not exact copies of reality but rather tools for thinking that deliberately simplify complexity to make phenomena comprehensible and manipulable.

In science education, models serve multiple essential functions:

**Explanatory function**: Models help explain phenomena that cannot be directly observed or are too complex to understand in their entirety. The particle model of matter, for instance, explains the behaviour of solids, liquids, and gases by positing the existence of submicroscopic particles in motion.

**Predictive function**: Models enable scientists and students to make predictions about how systems will behave under different conditions. A model of the solar system predicts planetary positions and eclipses.

**Heuristic function**: Models provide frameworks for investigating phenomena and generating new questions. They guide the design of experiments and observations.

**Communication function**: Models provide shared representations that enable scientists and learners to discuss and compare understandings of phenomena.

### Types of Models in Science Education

Models in science education take various forms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

**Physical models**: Concrete, tangible representations such as molecular models, anatomical models, or orreries. These are most accessible to younger learners but may create misconceptions if their limitations are not discussed.

**Diagrammatic models**: Visual representations including particle diagrams, food webs, and circuit diagrams. These abstract away from three-dimensional reality to highlight specific relationships.

**Mathematical models**: Equations and quantitative relationships that describe phenomena precisely. These become increasingly important in upper secondary and post-16 education.

**Computational models**: Simulations and computer-based representations that allow manipulation of variables and observation of emergent behaviours.

**Analogical models**: Explanations that draw parallels between familiar phenomena and unfamiliar scientific concepts, such as comparing electric current to water flow.

**Theoretical models**: Abstract conceptual frameworks such as the model of evolution by natural selection or the atomic model.

### The Nature of Models: Explicit Teaching Required

Research consistently demonstrates that students often misunderstand the nature of scientific models, treating them as copies of reality rather than simplified representations. This "naive realism" about models impedes scientific understanding and must be addressed through explicit teaching.

The Ofsted Science Research Review (2021) emphasises that effective science teaching must help pupils understand that:

- Models are simplifications that deliberately omit certain features of reality
- Different models may represent the same phenomenon in different ways for different purposes
- Models have limitations and domains of applicability
- Models change over time as scientific understanding develops
- Multiple models may coexist for the same phenomenon

Explicit discussion of these epistemological aspects of modelling should be woven throughout science education rather than addressed as isolated lessons.

## Progression in Model Use Across Key Stages

### Early Years Foundation Stage and Key Stage 1

In the Early Years, children naturally engage in modelling through play and exploration. They create physical representations and engage in pretend play that represents reality in simplified form. Science education at this stage should build on these intuitive modelling abilities.

The statutory framework for EYFS identifies "Understanding the World" as a key area, with children developing understanding of the natural world through observation and exploration. While formal modelling is not explicitly required, practitioners can introduce simple representations:

- Using simple diagrams to record observations of plants or animals
- Creating physical models of structures being investigated
- Using role-play to represent scientific processes such as the water cycle

Key Stage 1 introduces more structured modelling approaches. The National Curriculum requires pupils to:

- Identify and classify things observed
- Use simple equipment to gather data
- Record findings using drawings and simple diagrams

At this stage, models serve primarily to record and communicate observations. Pupils might:

- Draw diagrams showing the parts of plants
- Create simple food chains
- Use pictures to represent stages of material changes

Teachers should introduce the language of models explicitly, helping pupils understand that their drawings and representations are simplified versions of more complex realities.

### Key Stage 2

Key Stage 2 marks a significant development in pupils' engagement with scientific models. The National Curriculum introduces more abstract concepts that require modelling for comprehension, particularly in the areas of states of matter and living things.

**Particle models**: The KS2 programme of study explicitly requires that pupils be taught "that some materials will dissolve in liquid to form a solution, and describe how to recover a substance from a solution" and to "identify the part played by evaporation and condensation in the water cycle." These concepts are underpinned by the particle model of matter, which should be introduced at this stage.

Teachers should introduce the particle model gradually:

- Beginning with the idea that all matter is made of tiny particles too small to see
- Using the model to explain properties of solids, liquids, and gases
- Representing particle arrangements through diagrams
- Emphasising that the model helps explain observations even though we cannot see the particles

**Biological models**: KS2 pupils encounter increasingly sophisticated biological models:

- Life cycles represented as sequences of stages
- Food webs showing feeding relationships
- The human body represented through diagrams showing organ systems
- Classification keys that model relationships between organisms

**Earth and space models**: Pupils engage with models of the solar system, the movement of Earth, and the causes of day and night. These models challenge everyday experience and require careful introduction.

Research indicates that pupils at this age benefit from:

- Explicit discussion of what models are and why scientists use them
- Opportunities to evaluate the strengths and limitations of different models
- Recognition that multiple models may represent the same phenomenon
- Activities that connect models to concrete experiences and observations

### Key Stage 3

Key Stage 3 represents a major step forward in the sophistication of modelling expected in science. The National Curriculum introduces numerous concepts that are accessible only through modelling, and pupils are expected to engage more critically with the nature and limitations of models.

**The particle model**: KS3 develops the particle model substantially, requiring teaching about:

- The properties of the different states of matter in terms of particle arrangement and movement
- Changes of state as physical changes involving particle reorganisation
- Diffusion as evidence for particle movement
- Pressure in gases as resulting from particle collisions
- Atomic structure and the arrangement of electrons in atoms

At this stage, the particle model becomes more quantitative, with reference to relative particle spacing in different states and the relationship between temperature and particle energy.

**Cell models**: Biology at KS3 requires teaching about cells as the fundamental unit of living organisms. Pupils encounter:

- The cell as a basic model of living organisation
- Differences between animal, plant, and bacterial cells
- Cell structures and their functions
- The cell membrane model (selectively permeable barrier)

**Energy models**: The concept of energy is introduced through various models:

- Energy transfer and transformation represented through Sankey diagrams
- Stores and pathways models of energy
- The particulate nature of energy in kinetic theory

**Model evaluation**: KS3 pupils should engage explicitly with the nature of scientific models. They should understand that:

- Models are developed and refined over time
- Different models serve different purposes
- Models have predictive and explanatory power
- All models have limitations

The Association for Science Education recommends that KS3 teaching includes explicit discussion of how scientific models develop, using historical examples such as the changing models of the atom or the solar system.

### Key Stage 4 and GCSE

GCSE science requires sophisticated engagement with models across all three sciences. The increased mathematical demands of GCSE also introduce quantitative modelling approaches.

**Atomic and molecular models**: Chemistry at GCSE relies heavily on models of atomic structure, bonding, and chemical reactions:

- The nuclear model of the atom with electrons in shells
- Covalent, ionic, and metallic bonding models
- The collision theory model of reaction rates
- Equilibrium as a dynamic model

Pupils must understand the strengths and limitations of these models. For example, the ball-and-stick model of molecules is useful for visualising structure but misleading about the nature of chemical bonds.

**Genetic models**: Biology at GCSE requires understanding of:

- DNA as a model of genetic information storage
- The chromosome model of inheritance
- Natural selection as a model of evolutionary change
- Ecosystems models including pyramids of number, biomass, and energy

**Physical models**: Physics GCSE involves numerous models:

- The wave model of electromagnetic radiation
- The particle model of electricity (conventional current)
- The field model for gravitational, electrostatic, and magnetic forces
- Models of atomic structure including nuclear decay

**Mathematical modelling**: GCSE science increasingly requires mathematical modelling:

- Rate equations in chemistry
- Inverse square laws in physics
- Population models in biology

Post-16 A-Level science develops these modelling approaches substantially, introducing:

- Quantum mechanical models of the atom
- Advanced mathematical models in physics
- Biochemical pathway models
- Statistical models in biology

## Particle Models in Science Education

### Introduction and Development

The particle model of matter is arguably the most important model in school science, underpinning understanding in chemistry and physics across all key stages. The model posits that all matter consists of tiny particles (atoms, molecules, ions) that are in constant motion and interact with each other.

Effective teaching of the particle model requires careful attention to progression. Research indicates that pupils often develop misconceptions when the particle model is introduced too abstractly or without sufficient connection to observable phenomena.

### Key Stage 2 Foundations

At Key Stage 2, the particle model should be introduced through:

**Concrete experiences first**: Pupils should observe phenomena that the particle model explains—dissolving, evaporation, condensation, diffusion—before encountering the model itself.

**Simple representations**: Introducing matter as made of "tiny particles" or "bits too small to see" without premature emphasis on atoms and molecules.

**Focus on states of matter**: Using the model primarily to explain the differences between solids, liquids, and gases:

- Solids: particles close together, vibrating in fixed positions
- Liquids: particles close together but able to move past each other
- Gases: particles far apart, moving rapidly in all directions

**Diagrammatic conventions**: Teaching pupils to represent particle arrangements through standard diagrammatic conventions.

Common misconceptions at this stage include:

- Particles are small bits of solid, liquid, or gas (rather than the substance itself being particulate)
- Particles expand when heated (rather than the space between them increasing)
- The properties of the substance are shared by individual particles (e.g., a particle of water being wet)

Teachers should explicitly address these misconceptions through discussion and carefully designed activities.

### Key Stage 3 Development

At Key Stage 3, the particle model develops in sophistication:

**Internalising the model**: Pupils should move from seeing the particle model as a description of visible phenomena to understanding it as an explanatory framework for all matter.

**Temperature and energy**: The relationship between temperature and particle motion should be established, with temperature conceptualised as a measure of average particle kinetic energy.

**Pressure**: The particle model explains gas pressure as resulting from particle collisions with container walls. This requires careful introduction as it is not intuitively obvious.

**Diffusion**: The spreading out of particles in liquids and gases provides evidence for particle movement and can be modelled quantitatively.

**State changes**: The particle model explains changes of state as involving changes in particle energy and arrangement rather than changes in the particles themselves.

**Introducing atoms and molecules**: Distinctions between atoms, molecules, elements, and compounds should be established, with the particle model accommodating these categories.

Teaching strategies that support progression include:

- Using simulations that allow manipulation of particle behaviour
- Predict-observe-explain sequences where pupils use the particle model to make predictions
- Explicit discussion of model limitations (the particle model does not explain chemical bonding, for instance)
- Comparison of particle diagrams with macroscopic observations

### GCSE and Beyond

At GCSE, the particle model integrates with more sophisticated concepts:

**Atomic structure**: The particle model develops into the nuclear model of the atom, with electrons in energy levels or shells.

**Bonding models**: The particle model accommodates covalent, ionic, and metallic bonding as different modes of particle interaction.

**Kinetic theory**: Quantitative relationships between pressure, volume, and temperature are derived from particle behaviour.

**Chemical reactions**: Reactions are modelled as rearrangements of atoms, with conservation of mass explained in terms of particle preservation.

**Limitations**: Pupils should understand that the particle model has limitations—quantum mechanical effects at very small scales, for instance—and that more sophisticated models (quantum mechanics) are required for some phenomena.

## Biological Models in Science Education

### The Diversity of Biological Models

Biology relies extensively on models due to the complexity of living systems and the range of scales from molecules to ecosystems. Biological models in school science include:

**Structural models**: Representations of anatomical structures from cells to organ systems

**Process models**: Representations of dynamic processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, and the cardiac cycle

**Systems models**: Representations of interacting components in systems such as the nervous system or ecosystem

**Evolutionary models**: Representations of how populations change over time through natural selection

**Molecular models**: Representations of DNA, proteins, and biochemical processes

### Cells as the Fundamental Biological Model

The cell is the central model in biology, representing the basic unit of living organisation. The National Curriculum introduces cells at KS3 and develops understanding through GCSE.

**Key Stage 3 cell models**: At KS3, pupils should understand:

- The cell as the basic building block of living organisms
- Differences between animal and plant cells (and bacterial cells where taught)
- The functions of major cell structures: nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, cell wall, chloroplasts, mitochondria
- The cell membrane as a selectively permeable barrier

Teaching should emphasise that the cell is a model—an abstracted representation that focuses on certain features while omitting others. Real cells are three-dimensional, dynamic, and far more complex than textbook diagrams suggest.

**GCSE cell models**: GCSE develops cell biology substantially:

- Subcellular structures including ribosomes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts
- The role of DNA in the nucleus as the genetic material
- Cell division models: mitosis and meiosis
- Specialised cells and their adaptations
- Microscopy techniques that reveal cellular structures

Common misconceptions about cells include:

- Cells are two-dimensional (due to textbook diagrams)
- Cells are static rather than dynamic
- All cells look the same
- Cells in a tissue are independent rather than interacting
- The cell membrane is a solid wall rather than a dynamic boundary

Teachers should explicitly address these misconceptions through three-dimensional models, time-lapse microscopy, and discussion of model limitations.

### Models of Biological Processes

**Photosynthesis and respiration**: These fundamental processes are modelled at various levels of abstraction:

- Word equations summarising inputs and outputs
- Chemical equations representing molecular transformations
- Diagrammatic models showing inputs, processes, and outputs
- Molecular models of the biochemical pathways (advanced)

Pupils should understand that these models simplify complex biochemical processes involving numerous intermediate steps.

**The human body systems**: Organ systems are modelled as functional units:

- The digestive system as a sequence of organs with specific functions
- The respiratory system as gas exchange apparatus
- The circulatory system as a transport network
- The nervous system as communication pathways

These models help pupils understand function but may underemphasise integration between systems and dynamic regulation.

**Ecological models**: Ecosystems are represented through various models:

- Food chains and food webs showing feeding relationships
- Energy flow diagrams and pyramids
- Cycles (carbon, nitrogen, water) represented as circular flows
- Population models showing growth and limiting factors

These models necessarily simplify complex ecological interactions and may create misconceptions if their limitations are not discussed.

### Genetics and Evolution Models

**The DNA model**: The double helix model of DNA is iconic in biology education. Pupils should understand:

- DNA as a molecule carrying genetic information
- The structure: sugar-phosphate backbone with base pairs
- Base pairing rules: A-T, C-G
- DNA replication as a process preserving genetic information
- The relationship between DNA, genes, chromosomes, and proteins

Teaching should emphasise that this is a structural model that enables understanding of function—DNA's role in inheritance and protein synthesis.

**Inheritance models**: Patterns of inheritance are modelled through:

- Pedigree diagrams showing inheritance across generations
- Punnett squares predicting offspring ratios
- The chromosome model of meiosis and fertilisation

These models predict probabilities rather than certainties, and pupils should understand the distinction.

**Evolution by natural selection**: This is modelled as:

- Variation within populations
- Differential survival and reproduction
- Inheritance of advantageous traits
- Gradual change over generations

The model explains adaptation and speciation. Teaching should emphasise that evolution is a model that explains the diversity of life and the match between organisms and their environments.

## Pedagogical Approaches to Teaching Scientific Modelling

### Explicit Teaching of the Nature of Models

Research consistently shows that pupils do not automatically develop understanding of the nature and purpose of scientific models. Explicit teaching is essential:

**Meta-modelling discussions**: Regular discussion about what models are, why scientists use them, and how to evaluate them should be woven throughout science teaching.

**Comparing multiple models**: Presenting different models of the same phenomenon helps pupils understand that models are tools for thinking rather than copies of reality. For example, comparing the Bohr model of the atom with the quantum mechanical model.

**Evaluating model limitations**: Teaching pupils to identify what a model includes and excludes, what it explains well, and where it breaks down. This critical evaluation is central to scientific literacy.

**Historical context**: Showing how models have changed over time (e.g., from plum pudding to nuclear models of the atom) helps pupils understand that models are human constructions subject to revision.

**Multiple representations**: Using different types of models (physical, diagrammatic, mathematical) for the same phenomenon reinforces that no single model captures complete reality.

### Addressing Misconceptions in Modelling

Research has identified common misconceptions that arise from model use in science education. Effective teaching anticipates and addresses these:

**The reification error**: Pupils may treat models as actual entities rather than representations. For example, believing that atoms literally look like the ball-and-stick models used in classrooms.

**The single model fallacy**: Pupils may believe that only one correct model exists for any phenomenon, failing to understand that scientists use different models for different purposes.

**The perfect model expectation**: Pupils may reject useful models because of their limitations, not understanding that all models involve simplification.

**Scale confusion**: Particularly with particle models, pupils may struggle to connect microscopic models with macroscopic phenomena.

Addressing these misconceptions requires explicit discussion, opportunities for pupils to articulate their understanding, and carefully designed activities that highlight the nature of models.

### Using Models to Support Working Scientifically

Models are integral to working scientifically, supporting the development of key skills:

**Prediction**: Pupils use models to predict outcomes before conducting investigations.

**Explanation**: Models provide frameworks for explaining observed phenomena.

**Hypothesis generation**: Models suggest testable predictions and guide experimental design.

**Data interpretation**: Models help pupils make sense of collected data and identify patterns.

**Communication**: Models provide shared representations for discussing scientific ideas.

The Ofsted Science Research Review (2021) emphasises that effective practical work should be purposeful and theoretically grounded. Models provide this theoretical grounding, ensuring that practical activities are not merely procedural but conceptually meaningful.

## Conclusion: Models as Thinking Tools

Scientific models are not curiosities or teaching aids peripheral to "real" science—they are essential tools of scientific thinking. The particle model, cellular models, evolutionary models, and the countless other representations used in science classrooms are the same kinds of tools that working scientists use to make sense of the natural world.

Teaching modelling effectively requires more than simply presenting models to pupils. It requires explicit attention to the nature of models, their purposes, their limitations, and their development over time. Pupils need opportunities to use models to explain and predict, to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, and to understand how models relate to observable phenomena.

Progression in modelling is not merely about encountering more sophisticated models; it is about developing increasingly sophisticated understanding of what models are and how they function in scientific inquiry. From the simple drawings of Key Stage 1 to the quantitative mathematical models of A-Level, pupils should be developing meta-modelling understanding alongside their content knowledge.

The importance of models in science education cannot be overstated. Many scientific concepts are literally unthinkable without models—no one has seen an atom, a magnetic field, or evolution occurring across millions of years. Models make these concepts accessible, manipulable, and comprehensible. Effective science teaching ensures that pupils understand these essential tools of scientific thinking and can use them with understanding and critical awareness.
