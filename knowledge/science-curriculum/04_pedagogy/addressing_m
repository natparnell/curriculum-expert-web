# Addressing Scientific Misconceptions: Elicit-Challenge-Restructure and Bridging Analogies

Effective science teaching requires more than delivering accurate information—it demands deliberate strategies for identifying and transforming students' existing misconceptions. This knowledge file explores evidence-based approaches for addressing scientific misconceptions in primary and secondary classrooms, focusing on the elicit-challenge-restructure framework and the strategic use of bridging analogies.

## The Nature and Origins of Scientific Misconceptions

### What Are Misconceptions?

Scientific misconceptions, also termed alternative conceptions or preconceptions, represent ideas held by learners that contradict accepted scientific understanding (Posner, Strike, Hewson and Gertzog, 1982). These are not random errors or lapses in attention; rather, they constitute coherent, internally consistent frameworks that students have constructed to explain their experiences of the world. As the National Research Council's *Science Teaching Reconsidered* (1997) notes, misconceptions often represent students' best attempt to make sense of phenomena using available cognitive resources.

Misconceptions differ from simple misunderstandings in several critical ways. They are typically:

- **Resistant to change** through direct instruction or correction
- **Grounded in experience** derived from everyday interactions with the physical world
- **Cross-cultural** and observed consistently across different educational contexts
- **Developmentally persistent**, often re-emerging even after apparent resolution
- **Conceptually coherent** within the learner's existing framework

### Sources of Misconceptions

Understanding the origins of misconceptions helps teachers anticipate and address them systematically. Research identifies several primary sources:

**Everyday Experience and Perception**

Many misconceptions stem directly from how students experience the world. A child observes that objects "naturally" come to rest and concludes that motion requires continuous force—Aristotelian physics that contradicts Newton's first law. The sun appears to move across the sky, supporting geocentric intuitions. Heavy objects feel harder to lift, suggesting they fall faster than light ones. These perceptually grounded ideas are deeply entrenched because they successfully explain daily experience (Driver, Guesne and Tiberghien, 1985).

**Language and Everyday Terminology**

Scientific terms often carry different meanings in everyday usage. Students may believe that "heat" is a substance that flows (the caloric theory), that "plants get food from the soil," or that "sucking" creates vacuum. The word "energy" is used so loosely in everyday discourse ("I have no energy today") that students struggle to grasp its precise scientific definition.

**Instructional Legacy**

Paradoxically, previous teaching can contribute to misconceptions. Simplified models introduced at earlier key stages may become fossilised as students' understanding. The "solar system" model of the atom, while pedagogically useful, can lead students to imagine electrons orbiting nuclei like planets. Food webs presented as static diagrams may obscure the dynamic, interconnected nature of ecosystems.

**Cultural and Media Influences**

Television, films and popular media propagate scientific inaccuracies that take root in students' thinking. Cartoons showing characters running off cliffs and hovering before falling reinforce impetus theories of motion. Science fiction depicting sound in space or instantaneous space travel creates alternative cosmologies.

### Common Misconceptions by Domain

Research catalogues domain-specific misconceptions across the sciences. While an exhaustive list is impossible, illustrative examples demonstrate the breadth and depth of the challenge:

**Physics and Physical Processes**

- Force and motion: Objects require continuous force to maintain motion; heavier objects fall faster; there is no gravity in space
- Electricity: Current is "used up" as it flows around a circuit; batteries store electric charge; electrons move at the speed of light through wires
- Heat and temperature: Heat and cold are different substances; temperature measures heat content; sweaters generate heat
- Light and sight: Light fills space uniformly; eyes emit light enabling vision; shadows are "absence" of something

**Biology and Living Processes**

- Photosynthesis: Plants obtain food from soil rather than manufacturing it; plants breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide exclusively
- Genetics and inheritance: Acquired characteristics can be inherited; genes are passed only from fathers or only from mothers; "dominant" means "more common"
- Ecology: Food chains are linear rather than interconnected webs; decomposers are unnecessary for ecosystem function; animals are "higher" than plants
- Human biology: The heart creates blood; blood is blue inside the body; we have five senses

**Chemistry**

- Particulate nature of matter: Matter is continuous rather than particulate; particles expand when heated; gas has no mass
- Chemical change: Chemical changes are reversible by physical means; matter is destroyed in burning; atoms can be created or destroyed in reactions
- Solutions and mixtures: Dissolving is "disappearing"; solutions are pure substances; chemical bonds store energy that is released when bonds break

## Theoretical Frameworks for Conceptual Change

### Classical Conceptual Change Theory

Posner, Strike, Hewson and Gertzog (1982) provided the foundational theoretical framework for understanding how scientific conceptions replace misconceptions. Their work, developed at Cornell University, conceptualised learning science as analogous to theory change in the history of science—what Kuhn (1970) termed "scientific revolutions."

According to this classical model, accommodation of a scientific conception requires four conditions:

**Dissatisfaction with Existing Conceptions**

Learners must first experience dissatisfaction with their current ideas. Without this cognitive dissonance, there is no impetus for change. Dissatisfaction arises when existing conceptions prove inadequate to explain new experiences or observations.

**Intelligibility of the New Conception**

The scientific conception must be intelligible—learners must be able to grasp what it means. This requires sufficient prior knowledge and appropriate representation of the new idea. A quantum mechanical model of the atom cannot be intelligible to a Key Stage 3 student lacking the mathematical and conceptual prerequisites.

**Plausibility of the New Conception**

The new conception must appear plausible, capable of explaining the phenomena better than the existing alternative. Plausibility is domain-specific and depends on the learner's epistemological commitments.

**Fruitfulness of the New Conception**

Finally, the new conception must prove fruitful—capable of generating new insights, predictions and research questions. Scientific theories are valued for their explanatory and predictive power.

### Implications for Pedagogy

The classical conceptual change model has profound implications for classroom practice. It suggests that effective science teaching must do more than present correct information; it must actively create the conditions for conceptual change. This requires:

- Making students' alternative conceptions explicit and visible
- Creating cognitive conflict or dissatisfaction with existing ideas
- Introducing scientific conceptions in intelligible, plausible and fruitful ways
- Providing opportunities for students to apply and consolidate new conceptions

However, subsequent research has complicated this picture. Not all learning proceeds through dramatic theory replacement; much conceptual development involves gradual refinement, extension and enrichment of existing ideas (Vosniadou, 1994). The "knowledge-in-pieces" perspective (diSessa, 1993) suggests that intuitive knowledge consists of fragmented phenomenological primitives that are recontextualised rather than replaced.

## The Elicit-Challenge-Restructure Framework

Building on conceptual change theory, the elicit-challenge-restructure (ECR) framework provides a practical pedagogical structure for addressing misconceptions in the classroom. This three-phase approach has been refined through extensive classroom research and is endorsed by the Education Endowment Foundation (2020) and other evidence-based organisations.

### Phase 1: Elicit

The elicitation phase focuses on surfacing students' existing ideas before formal instruction begins. This diagnostic stage is essential because misconceptions are often invisible to teachers and may differ substantially from professional expectations.

**Diagnostic Assessment Strategies**

Effective elicitation requires carefully designed diagnostic assessments that reveal thinking without prematurely correcting it. The University of York Science Education Group's *Best Evidence Science Teaching* (BEST) resources provide extensive collections of diagnostic questions specifically targeting known misconceptions.

*Multiple Choice Questions with Distractors*

Diagnostic multiple choice questions include distractors—plausible wrong answers that correspond to common misconceptions. When a significant proportion of students select a particular distractor, the teacher gains immediate insight into prevalent alternative conceptions. For example:

> Two identical balloons are filled with air. One is placed in a freezer for an hour. What happens to the mass of the cooled balloon?
> a) It decreases because cold air is lighter
> b) It stays the same because the amount of air hasn't changed
> c) It increases because cold air is denser
> d) It disappears because cold destroys air

Each incorrect option reveals a different misconception about mass, density and the particulate nature of matter.

*Predict-Observe-Explain (POE)*

The POE strategy engages students in predicting experimental outcomes, observing actual results and explaining any discrepancies. This creates natural opportunities for misconceptions to surface. For example, before demonstrating that a lemon sinks in water but floats in denser sugar solution, students predict and justify their expectations. Their explanations reveal their understanding of density and buoyancy.

*Concept Cartoons*

Concept cartoons present cartoon characters expressing different viewpoints about a scientific phenomenon. Students select which character they agree with and explain their reasoning. This low-stakes approach encourages students to articulate ideas they might otherwise keep private.

*Think-Pair-Share*

Structured discussion protocols allow students to externalise thinking before whole-class sharing. The "think" phase provides individual processing time; "pair" creates a safe space for tentative ideas; "share" brings diverse conceptions into collective awareness.

**Clinical Interviews**

For detailed individual assessment, clinical interviews provide rich diagnostic information. Developed by Piaget and refined by science education researchers, clinical interviews probe reasoning through flexible questioning rather than fixed protocols. While time-intensive, interviews reveal the depth and coherence of individual students' conceptual frameworks.

### Phase 2: Challenge

Once misconceptions are elicited, the challenge phase creates cognitive conflict—experiences that demonstrate the inadequacy of existing conceptions. Effective challenge activities make the limitations of misconceptions undeniable without simply asserting that students are wrong.

**Creating Cognitive Conflict**

Cognitive conflict arises when predictions based on existing conceptions prove incorrect. The discrepancy between expectation and observation generates the dissatisfaction necessary for conceptual change. However, research cautions that cognitive conflict alone is insufficient; learners may reject, reinterpret or minimise discrepant evidence rather than abandoning cherished conceptions (Chinn and Brewer, 1993).

Effective challenge strategies include:

*Discrepant Events*

Demonstrations producing surprising outcomes challenge expectations directly. A classic example: placing one hand in hot water, the other in cold, then both in lukewarm water produces contradictory temperature perceptions. This challenges the assumption that temperature is an intrinsic property of objects rather than a perceptual experience.

Similarly, a heavy object and light object dropped simultaneously challenge the expectation that heavier objects fall faster. The teacher must ensure students actually observe what happens rather than "seeing" what they expect—often requiring slow-motion video or repeated demonstrations.

*Refutation Texts*

Refutation texts explicitly state common misconceptions, refute them with evidence and present the scientific conception. Research by Tippett (2010) and others demonstrates that refutation texts can be more effective than expository texts in promoting conceptual change, particularly when students hold strong misconceptions.

A refutation text might begin: "Many people think that plants get their food from the soil through their roots. However, this is not correct. Plants actually make their own food through photosynthesis..."

*Predict-Observe-Explain Revisited*

When POE predictions prove incorrect, the explanation phase naturally creates cognitive conflict. The teacher's role is to sustain this conflict long enough for students to engage with alternative explanations, rather than immediately providing the "correct" answer.

**Socratic Questioning**

Skillful questioning can guide students to recognise internal inconsistencies in their thinking. Rather than telling students they are wrong, the teacher asks questions that reveal logical contradictions or empirical inadequacies:

> "If objects naturally come to rest, why does the Earth keep spinning?"
> "If cold is a substance that flows into objects, where does it go when things warm up?"
> "If current is used up in a circuit, how can anything happen at all?"

Such questions require students to confront the limitations of their own frameworks.

### Phase 3: Restructure

The restructuring phase supports students in developing and consolidating scientific conceptions. This goes beyond simply telling students the correct answer; it requires active construction of new understanding within a supportive conceptual framework.

**Building New Conceptual Structures**

Restructuring involves reorganising knowledge at multiple levels. At the surface level, students learn new facts and definitions. At the deep structure level, they develop new ontological categories and causal mechanisms. For example, understanding that heat is not a substance but energy in transit requires fundamental reconceptualisation of thermal phenomena.

**Scaffolded Instruction**

Vygotskian scaffolding provides temporary support that enables students to perform beyond their current independent capability. In science education, scaffolding might include:

- **Procedural scaffolds**: Step-by-step protocols for scientific investigations
- **Conceptual scaffolds**: Graphic organisers showing relationships between concepts
- **Strategic scaffolds**: Heuristics for problem-solving and inquiry
- **Metacognitive scaffolds**: Prompts for reflection and self-assessment

Scaffolds are gradually withdrawn as student competence develops—what Wood, Bruner and Ross (1976) termed "fading."

**Consolidation and Application**

New conceptions require consolidation through repeated application in diverse contexts. Students who can explain density in terms of floating and sinking may struggle to apply the same concept to convection currents or weather patterns. Deliberate practice across varied contexts builds robust, transferable understanding.

The "Assess and Review" stage recommended by the EEF (2020) emphasises checking understanding not only in the original teaching context but also in subsequent topics where the same concepts reappear. Misconceptions have a habit of re-emerging when students encounter new domains.

## Bridging Analogies: A Strategic Approach

Bridging analogies represent a powerful but nuanced approach to conceptual change. When used effectively, analogies connect unfamiliar scientific concepts to familiar experiences, creating stepping stones toward scientific understanding. When used poorly, analogies can generate or reinforce misconceptions.

### The Anatomy of Analogies

An analogy asserts structural correspondence between two domains: the familiar source (or analogue) and the unfamiliar target. For the analogy to support learning, learners must map relevant structural relationships from source to target while ignoring superficial similarities.

Gentner's (1983) structure-mapping theory distinguishes:

- **Attributes**: Surface features that may or may not correspond
- **Relations**: Structural relationships that form the basis of valid analogy
- **Higher-order relations**: Systems of relations that define deeper structure

Consider the water circuit analogy for electric circuits: water flowing through pipes corresponds to electric current flowing through wires. The analogy maps relations (flow, pressure difference, resistance) while warning against attributing material properties of water to immaterial current.

### Types of Analogies in Science Education

**Simple Analogies**

Simple analogies draw direct comparisons between source and target. The atom is like a miniature solar system; DNA is like a recipe; natural selection is like a sieve. These analogies provide initial orientation but risk generating misconceptions if taken too literally.

**Multiple Analogies**

Research by Glynn and colleagues demonstrates that presenting multiple analogies for the same concept can be more effective than relying on a single analogy. Different analogies illuminate different aspects of the target concept. For electric circuits, teachers might use the water analogy (emphasising flow and resistance), the rope analogy (emphasising simultaneous action throughout the circuit) and the traffic analogy (emphasising current division at junctions).

However, multiple analogies require explicit discussion of how each analogy is like and unlike the target concept. Without this "analogical encoding" (Richland and Simms, 2015), students may conflate features of different analogies or overextend analogical mappings.

**Bridging Analogies**

Clement and colleagues (Clement, 1993; Brown and Clement, 1989) developed the bridging analogy approach specifically for addressing deeply entrenched misconceptions. Rather than directly contrasting the misconception with the scientific conception, bridging analogies create intermediate cases that gradually shift student thinking.

Consider the common misconception that a table does not exert an upward force on a book resting upon it. Students find this counterintuitive because the table is "just sitting there." A direct bridging sequence might proceed:

1. **Anchor case**: A hand supports a book—students accept the upward force intuitively
2. **Bridging case 1**: A flexible board supports the book—still intuitively involves upward force
3. **Bridging case 2**: A slightly bouncy surface (like a trampoline) supports the book—still involves upward force
4. **Target case**: A rigid table supports the book—the upward force is less visible but must still exist

Each step in the bridge preserves the structural relationship (upward supporting force) while reducing the salience of the supporting action. Students who resist the direct assertion that tables exert upward forces may accept the conclusion when reached through this graduated sequence.

### Teaching with Analogies: Best Practice

The Analogical Teaching Model (ATM) developed by Glynn (2008) and refined by others provides a structured approach:

**Introduce the Target Concept**

Begin by establishing what students need to learn—the target concept that is difficult or abstract.

**Introduce the Analogue**

Present the familiar source domain, ensuring all students share relevant prior knowledge.

**Identify Relevant Features**

Explicitly map the structural correspondences between analogue and target. What is like what? What relationships transfer?

**Draw Conclusions**

Guide students to apply understanding from the analogue to the target concept.

**Identify Breakdowns**

Crucially, explicitly discuss where the analogy breaks down. What is NOT like the target? Where does the mapping fail? Without this step, students may generate misconceptions by overextending the analogy.

**Summarise and Consolidate**

Conclude by summarising the target concept independently of the analogy, ensuring students do not remain dependent on the analogue for understanding.

### Pitfalls and Misconceptions from Analogies

Analogies can be double-edged swords. Research identifies several ways analogies generate rather than resolve misconceptions:

**False Analogies**

When analogies are structurally flawed, they transmit misunderstanding. The "solar system" model of the atom, while historically
