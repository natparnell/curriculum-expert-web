# Common Scientific Misconceptions by Topic and Key Stage

## Introduction

Scientific misconceptions represent one of the most significant challenges facing primary science teachers. These alternative conceptions—ideas that contradict accepted scientific understanding—are remarkably persistent, often surviving explicit correction and re-emerging months or years after apparent resolution. The Driver and Easley study (1978) first brought widespread attention to the prevalence of these misconceptions, documenting consistent patterns across learners that suggested something more systematic than random error was at work.

This knowledge file provides a comprehensive catalogue of common scientific misconceptions organised by topic area and key stage. It identifies diagnostic strategies for uncovering these hidden misconceptions and outlines evidence-based approaches for supporting conceptual change. By understanding the specific misconceptions that pupils are likely to hold at each stage of their education, teachers can design instruction that directly addresses and transforms these alternative conceptions.

## The Persistence of Misconceptions

### Why Misconceptions Are So Resistant

Scientific misconceptions are not simple errors or moments of confusion. They represent coherent, internally consistent frameworks that pupils have constructed to make sense of their experiences. As Posner, Strike, Hewson and Gertzog (1982) established in their seminal work on conceptual change, these alternative conceptions often satisfy the same criteria that scientific theories do: they are intelligible, plausible, and fruitful for the learner who holds them.

Consider the common misconception that objects require continuous force to maintain motion. From the perspective of everyday experience, this conception is remarkably successful. A ball rolled across the playground slows and stops; a bicycle requires continuous pedalling to keep moving; a shopping trolley stops when you stop pushing it. The scientific conception—inertia and the role of friction—requires learners to trust abstract principles over direct perceptual experience. Small wonder that many pupils, and indeed many adults, continue to hold Aristotelian intuitions about motion despite instruction in Newtonian physics.

### Developmental Trajectories

Research by Shapiro (2004) and others has documented how misconceptions evolve across developmental stages. Some misconceptions are characteristic of particular age groups, while others persist from early childhood through adulthood. Understanding these trajectories helps teachers anticipate which misconceptions are likely to be held by pupils at each key stage.

## Biology Misconceptions

### Living Things and Their Habitats (KS1)

**Misconception: All plants are vegetables**

Young children often classify plants based on human utility rather than biological characteristics. Trees and flowers may not be recognised as plants because they are not eaten, while fungi are sometimes classified as plants despite being a separate kingdom entirely.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Present children with a range of images including trees, flowers, vegetables, fungi, coral, and seaweed. Ask them to group the items and explain their reasoning. Listen for anthropocentric criteria ("we eat these") versus biological criteria ("they grow, need water, make seeds").

**Misconception: Animals are furry creatures that run around**

Many KS1 pupils hold a restricted definition of "animal" that excludes insects, fish, birds, and other less obviously "animal-like" creatures. This misconception reflects the everyday usage of the term "animal" versus its scientific meaning.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Use card sorting activities with images of diverse organisms. Ask pupils to identify which are animals and justify their choices. Pay attention to whether whales, insects, and worms are classified correctly.

**Misconception: Plants get food from the soil through their roots**

This is one of the most persistent misconceptions in primary biology. Children observe plants growing in soil and logically conclude that the soil provides their food. The scientific understanding—that plants manufacture their own food through photosynthesis using light energy—is counterintuitive.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Ask pupils to explain what would happen to a plant grown in soil with no light versus a plant grown in water with plenty of light. Pupils holding the misconception typically predict that the soil-grown plant will survive while the water-grown plant will not.

### Plants (KS1-KS2)

**Misconception: Leaves are primarily for collecting water**

While leaves do collect some water, their primary function is photosynthesis. Children who have observed water droplets on leaves may overemphasise this function.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Present pupils with the question "Why do plants have leaves?" and collect responses. Follow up by asking what would happen if a plant had all its leaves removed but still had roots in water.

**Misconception: Roots absorb food from the soil**

Related to the "plants get food from soil" misconception, this alternative conception involves understanding roots as absorbing nutrients directly as food rather than absorbing water and minerals that support photosynthesis.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: The van Helmont experiment (where a willow tree gained mass while the soil lost almost none) provides a classic demonstration, though its historical complexity requires careful handling with primary pupils.

**Misconception: Seeds are not alive**

Children often struggle with the concept of dormant life. Seeds may be viewed as non-living because they do not exhibit obvious life processes like growth or movement.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Ask pupils directly whether a seed is alive and what evidence they would need to decide. Present scenarios such as "Is a seed alive after sitting in a packet for a year?" and "Is a seed alive after being boiled?"

### Animals Including Humans (KS1-KS2)

**Misconception: The heart pumps blood out through the body and does not receive blood back**

Many pupils hold a simplified, one-way model of circulation where the heart pumps blood to the body but do not understand the return journey or the pulmonary circuit.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Ask pupils to draw or describe the path of blood through the body. Look for drawings showing only one direction of flow or confusion about the heart's chambers.

**Misconception: Food goes into the stomach and stays there**

Young children often view the stomach as a storage organ rather than part of a continuous digestive system. They may not understand that food moves through the system and exits the body.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Ask pupils to describe what happens to food after they swallow it. Listen for indications that they believe food stays in the stomach indefinitely or simply "disappears."

**Misconception: Blood inside the body is blue**

Children frequently believe that deoxygenated blood is blue, based on the appearance of veins through the skin. This misconception is reinforced by textbook diagrams using blue to represent deoxygenated blood.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Ask pupils what colour blood is. Follow up by asking why veins look blue and whether anyone has seen blue blood when they cut themselves.

**Misconception: The brain is only for thinking**

Pupils often have a restricted understanding of brain function, associating it only with conscious thought and not with controlling movement, regulating body temperature, or managing basic life functions.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Ask pupils what the brain does. Present scenarios such as "What controls your breathing when you're asleep?" or "What tells your hand to move away from something hot?"

### Evolution and Inheritance (Upper KS2)

**Misconception: Evolution happens to individuals during their lifetime**

Lamarckian ideas about evolution persist remarkably strongly. Pupils may believe that giraffes developed long necks because individuals stretched to reach high leaves, and that this characteristic was then passed to offspring.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Present the giraffe scenario and ask pupils to explain how giraffes got long necks. Listen for references to individual adaptation versus population-level change over generations.

**Misconception: All mutations are harmful**

Children often associate mutation with negative outcomes, influenced by popular culture depictions of mutations as causing disease or monstrous characteristics.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Discuss examples of beneficial or neutral mutations such as antibiotic resistance in bacteria or different coloured eyes in humans.

## Chemistry Misconceptions

### Materials and Their Properties (KS1)

**Misconception: Materials can only be solids, liquids, or gases**

Young children struggle with materials that do not fit neatly into these categories. Foam, jelly, sand, and other complex materials challenge their emerging classification systems.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Present children with a collection of challenging materials (foam, sand, jelly, shaving foam, oobleck) and ask them to classify each as solid, liquid, or gas. Note their reasoning and any discomfort with classification.

**Misconception: Weight and size are the same thing**

Children often confuse size (volume) with weight, predicting that larger objects are always heavier regardless of material.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Present pupils with a large polystyrene block and a small metal block. Ask which is heavier and why. Then have them compare on balance scales.

**Misconception: Hard materials cannot break**

Children may associate hardness with indestructibility, not understanding that hard materials like glass or ceramic can be strong but brittle.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Ask pupils to predict what will happen if a glass marble is hit with a hammer. Record their predictions before demonstrating.

### States of Matter (Lower KS2)

**Misconception: Gases are not matter because you cannot see them**

Many pupils do not recognise gases as having mass or occupying space because they are invisible. This misconception underlies difficulties with understanding air pressure and atmospheric phenomena.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Ask pupils whether air has weight and how they could test this. The classic inverted glass of water with card experiment can demonstrate that air occupies space.

**Misconception: Boiling and evaporation are different processes**

Pupils often view boiling and evaporation as fundamentally different, not recognising that both involve liquid turning to gas. They may believe evaporation involves the liquid "disappearing" rather than changing state.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Set up water in various contexts (boiling kettle, puddle outside, wet cloth) and ask pupils to explain what is happening to the water in each case.

**Misconception: Bubbles in boiling water are made of air**

Children frequently believe that the bubbles in boiling water contain air rather than water vapour. This misconception interferes with understanding the phase change process.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Ask pupils what is inside the bubbles when water boils. Follow up by asking where that substance comes from and what would happen if you collected the bubbles.

### Properties and Changes of Materials (Upper KS2)

**Misconception: Dissolving is the same as melting**

Pupils may conflate dissolving (a physical change where a substance disperses in a solvent) with melting (a physical change from solid to liquid due to temperature). They may believe the solid "disappears" when it dissolves.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Compare salt dissolving in water with ice melting. Ask pupils to describe what happens to the salt crystals and how this differs from what happens to ice.

**Misconception: Chemical changes are reversible by simple physical means**

Children often believe that changes like burning can be reversed (e.g., by sticking the ash back together) or that rust can be removed to restore the original metal.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Show pupils examples of irreversible changes and ask whether the original material can be recovered. Be specific: "If you could collect all the smoke and ash from a burnt match, could you make it back into a match?"

**Misconception: Mass is not conserved during dissolving**

When a solid dissolves, pupils may believe it has disappeared and therefore no longer has mass. This reflects the difficulty of accepting that substances can exist without being visible.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Weigh a container of water, add salt, allow it to dissolve, and weigh again. Ask pupils to predict the result before weighing.

## Physics Misconceptions

### Forces and Magnets (KS1-Lower KS2)

**Misconception: Forces are only pushes and pulls from living things**

Young children often restrict the concept of force to intentional actions by animals or people. They may not recognise gravity, friction, or air resistance as forces.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Ask pupils what forces are acting on a ball rolling across the floor. Listen for references to the initial push but not to friction or gravity.

**Misconception: Heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones**

Aristotelian physics persists in children's thinking. Many pupils predict that a heavy object will hit the ground before a light one dropped simultaneously.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Use the classic dropped object demonstration with objects of different masses but similar air resistance (e.g., two different-sized balls). Have pupils predict before observing.

**Misconception: Magnets only attract metals**

Children often generalise that all metals are magnetic, not understanding that magnetism is a property of specific materials (iron, nickel, cobalt and some of their alloys).

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Provide a selection of metal objects including copper, aluminium, iron, and steel items. Have pupils test each with a magnet and record their findings.

**Misconception: Magnetic force requires contact**

Pupils may not initially understand that magnetic forces act at a distance without physical contact between objects.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Demonstrate a magnet attracting a paperclip through a thin barrier (paper, plastic). Ask pupils to explain how the magnet affects the clip without touching it.

### Light (Upper KS2)

**Misconception: Light fills space rather than travelling in straight lines**

Children often view light as a generalised illumination that fills rooms rather than understanding it as rays travelling in straight lines from sources.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Ask pupils to explain how light gets from a lamp to their eyes. Listen for references to light "spreading out" or "filling the room" rather than travelling in specific paths.

**Misconception: Objects produce light by colour rather than reflecting it**

Pupils may believe that coloured objects actually emit coloured light rather than reflecting specific wavelengths while absorbing others.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Show a red object in a room lit only by blue light (where it will appear dark). Ask pupils to predict and explain what they observe.

**Misconception: Mirrors reverse left and right but not up and down**

This classic misconception reflects the difficulty of understanding reflection. Pupils struggle to explain why mirrors seem to swap left and right but not top and bottom.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Have pupils write their name on paper and hold it in front of a mirror. Ask them to explain what the mirror does to the writing and why.

**Misconception: We see objects because light comes out of our eyes**

The extramission theory of vision—where the eye sends out rays to see objects—was held by ancient Greek philosophers and persists in many children's thinking.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Ask pupils directly how we see things. Listen for phrases like "light comes from our eyes" or "we send out looking rays."

### Sound (Upper KS2)

**Misconception: Sound can travel through a vacuum if it is loud enough**

Children often struggle with the concept that sound requires a medium. They may believe that very loud sounds (like explosions) can travel through empty space.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Ask pupils whether astronauts on the Moon could hear each other speaking without radio equipment. Probe their understanding of why sound needs a medium.

**Misconception: Sound travels faster in air than in solids**

Intuitively, pupils may believe that sound travels best through the medium they experience it in most commonly (air), not understanding that denser materials transmit vibrations more efficiently.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Use the classic demonstration of hearing a ticking clock through a table versus through the air. Ask pupils to predict before demonstrating.

**Misconception: Loudness and pitch are the same thing**

Younger pupils often conflate the volume of a sound with its pitch, describing high sounds as "loud" and low sounds as "quiet."

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Play sounds that vary independently in loudness and pitch. Ask pupils to describe each sound using both dimensions separately.

### Electricity (Upper KS2)

**Misconception: Electricity is a fluid that flows out of the battery and is used up by components**

The single-fluid model of electricity persists strongly. Pupils often believe that current leaves the battery, is "used up" by the bulb, and therefore less current returns than left.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Ask pupils what happens to electricity after it goes through a bulb. Listen for references to electricity being "used up," "turning into light," or being "weaker" after passing through components.

**Misconception: Batteries contain electricity inside them like water in a tank**

Children may view batteries as containers of electricity rather than devices that create electrical potential through chemical reactions.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Ask pupils what is inside a battery and what happens when it "runs out." Listen for references to stored electricity versus chemical changes.

**Misconception: All metals are good conductors because they are metals**

While pupils may correctly identify metals as conductors, they may not understand the underlying property (free electrons) and may struggle with exceptions or differences in conductivity between metals.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Compare the conductivity of different metals using brightness of bulbs or ammeter readings. Ask pupils to explain why some metals conduct better than others.

**Misconception: A circuit must be circular to work**

While pupils may learn that circuits form complete loops, they may not understand why this matters. Some may view the circular shape itself as important rather than the continuous conductive path.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Present pupils with circuits that are electrically continuous but not geometrically circular, and circular arrangements that are not electrically continuous. Ask them to predict which will work.

### Earth and Space (Upper KS2)

**Misconception: The Sun moves around the Earth**

Geocentric intuitions are extremely persistent. The apparent motion of the Sun across the sky strongly supports the intuitive view that the Sun orbits the Earth.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Ask pupils to explain why the Sun appears to move across the sky. Listen for heliocentric versus geocentric explanations.

**Misconception: Seasons are caused by the Earth's distance from the Sun**

Many pupils believe that summer occurs when the Earth is closer to the Sun and winter when it is farther away. This misconception may be reinforced by diagrams showing elliptical orbits exaggerated for effect.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Ask pupils to explain why we have seasons. If they mention distance, probe further: "Is the UK closer to the Sun in June or December?" Follow up by asking why Australia has summer when Britain has winter.

**Misconception: The Moon produces its own light**

Children may believe the Moon glows like the Sun rather than reflecting sunlight. This misconception interferes with understanding lunar phases.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Ask pupils directly where the Moon's light comes from. Present a crescent moon and ask why only part of it is visible if it produces its own light.

**Misconception: Day and night are caused by the Sun going around the Earth or the Sun going behind the Earth**

Pupils may attribute day and night to the Sun orbiting the Earth rather than Earth's rotation, or imagine the Sun moving behind a stationary Earth.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Ask pupils to explain why we have day and night. Have them model the system using a lamp and ball to reveal their understanding.

**Misconception: Gravity is stronger when you are higher up**

Counterintuitively, some pupils believe gravity increases with altitude, perhaps associating height with danger or the feeling of falling.

*Diagnostic Strategy*: Ask pupils whether gravity is stronger on a mountain top or at sea level. Follow up by asking why astronauts appear weightless in space.

## Cross-Cutting Diagnostic Strategies

### Concept Cartoons

Concept cartoons present pupils with cartoon characters expressing different viewpoints about a scientific phenomenon. Pupils select which character they agree with and explain their reasoning. This strategy makes multiple misconceptions visible simultaneously and creates opportunities for productive discussion.

*Example for Forces*: Show characters arguing about whether a ball thrown upward has forces acting on it at the top of its flight. One says "no forces—it's stopped," another says "gravity pulls it down," a third says "the throw force is still acting."

### Predict-Observe-Explain (POE)

The POE strategy engages pupils in predicting experimental outcomes, observing actual results, and explaining any discrepancies. This creates natural opportunities for misconceptions to surface and be challenged.

*Implementation Steps*:
1. Present the phenomenon and elicit predictions
2. Have pupils record predictions with reasoning
3. Conduct the demonstration
4. Ask pupils to explain any discrepancies between prediction and observation
5. Facilitate discussion of the scientific explanation

### Two-Tier Diagnostic Questions

Two-tier questions have two parts: a content question and a reasoning question. The first tier assesses conceptual understanding; the second tier reveals the thinking behind the answer.

*Example*:
Tier 1: What happens to the mass of ice when it melts?
a) Increases  b) Stays the same  c) Decreases

Tier 2: Why?
a) The ice changes into water which weighs more
b) Nothing is added or removed, so mass stays the same
c) Some water evaporates during melting
d) The cold from the ice disappears

### Drawing and Modelling

Asking pupils to draw or model their understanding often reveals misconceptions that would remain hidden in verbal responses. Diagrams of circuits, the solar system, or the human body can expose alternative conceptions clearly.

*Implementation Tips*:
- Provide blank paper without pre-drawn elements that might constrain responses
- Ask pupils to add labels and annotations explaining their thinking
- Use a consistent rubric to analyse drawings across the class
- Compare pre- and post-instruction drawings to track conceptual change

### Interview Protocols

Structured interviews allow teachers to probe understanding deeply, following pupils' reasoning to uncover the origins of misconceptions.

*Key Techniques*:
- Ask "Why do you think that?" repeatedly
- Present counter-evidence and ask pupils to explain discrepancies
- Use hypotheticals: "What if...?"
- Ask pupils to predict outcomes of untested scenarios
- Have pupils explain to a hypothetical younger child

## Conceptual Change Strategies

### Creating Cognitive Conflict

Cognitive conflict arises when predictions based on existing conceptions prove incorrect. The discrepancy between expectation and observation generates the dissatisfaction necessary for conceptual change.

*Effective Approaches*:
- Use surprising demonstrations that directly contradict predictions
- Have pupils make explicit predictions before observing outcomes
- Highlight the failure of existing conceptions to explain observations
- Be sensitive to pupils who may modify their memories of predictions to reduce dissonance

### Using Analogies and Models

Analogies bridge between familiar phenomena and scientific concepts. Effective analogies map key relationships while making limitations explicit.

*The Water Circuit Analogy*: Water flowing through pipes can help pupils understand current in circuits. However, teachers must explicitly address limitations (water does not get "used up" like energy is transferred).

*The Rope Model for Sound*: Vibrations travelling along a rope can demonstrate how sound propagates without the medium itself moving from source to receiver.

### Refutation Texts

Refutation texts explicitly state common misconceptions, refute them with evidence, and present the scientific conception. Research shows these texts are more effective than texts that present correct information without acknowledging misconceptions.

*Structure*:
1. State the common misconception
2. Present evidence that contradicts it
3. Explain why the misconception seems plausible but is incorrect
4. Present the scientific conception
5. Show how the scientific conception explains the evidence

### Bridging Analogies

Developed by John Clement, bridging analogies help pupils move from intuitive misconceptions toward scientific understanding through intermediate steps.

*Example for Force and Motion*:
- Anchoring intuition: A book sliding across a table slows down (friction evident)
- Bridging case: A puck sliding on ice slows less
- Target case: An object in space keeps moving indefinitely (Newton's first law)

### Metacognitive Strategies

Helping pupils become aware of their own thinking supports conceptual change. Metacognitive approaches include:

*Thinking About Thinking*: Ask pupils to reflect on how their ideas have changed and what caused the change.

*Explicit Comparison*: Have pupils compare their initial predictions with observations and explain the differences.

*Journaling*: Regular science journals where pupils record predictions, observations, and evolving explanations make conceptual change visible over time.

## Implications for Teaching

### Spiral Curriculum Design

Given the persistence of misconceptions, effective science teaching must revisit concepts at increasing depth across key stages. Each encounter should explicitly address known misconceptions while building more sophisticated understanding.

### Formative Assessment Focus

Regular diagnostic assessment should probe for misconceptions rather than simply checking recall. Questions that reveal thinking are more valuable than questions that only assess factual knowledge.

### Creating Safe Environments

Pupils must feel safe to express misconceptions without fear of ridicule. When teachers respond to misconceptions with curiosity rather than correction, pupils are more willing to expose their thinking for examination.

### Teacher Knowledge Requirements

Effective misconception-based teaching requires teachers to know:
- The common misconceptions associated with each topic
- The developmental trajectories of misconception change
- Diagnostic strategies for revealing hidden misconceptions
- Evidence-based approaches for supporting conceptual change

## Conclusion

Scientific misconceptions are not failures of teaching or learning—they are natural consequences of how human cognition works to make sense of experience. By understanding the systematic nature of these alternative conceptions, teachers can design instruction that directly addresses and transforms them.

The catalogue of misconceptions presented in this knowledge file represents research findings from decades of science education studies. While individual pupils may hold idiosyncratic ideas, the patterns documented here are remarkably consistent across learners. This consistency is a gift to teachers: it allows anticipation, targeted diagnosis, and strategic intervention.

Effective science teaching does not merely present correct information. It actively explores pupils' existing ideas, creates experiences that challenge misconceptions, and supports the construction of more scientifically accurate understanding. By taking misconceptions seriously as coherent, experience-based frameworks, teachers can help pupils achieve genuine conceptual change rather than superficial compliance.
