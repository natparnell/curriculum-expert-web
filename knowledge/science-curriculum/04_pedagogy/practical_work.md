# Practical Work in Science Education

## Overview

Practical work has long been regarded as a defining feature of science education, distinguishing it from other subjects and providing students with direct experience of the phenomena, materials, and methods that characterise scientific inquiry. Despite its prominence in science classrooms, questions about the effectiveness of practical work as a teaching and learning strategy have been raised by researchers and educators over several decades. Understanding how to make practical work genuinely effective requires careful consideration of learning objectives, activity design, and the relationship between hands-on experience and conceptual understanding.

Robin Millar, working with colleagues including Ian Abrahams at the University of York, has developed influential frameworks for analysing and improving the effectiveness of practical work. Their research, particularly the seminal 2008 study "Does Practical Work Really Work?" published in the *International Journal of Science Education*, provides a robust evidence base for understanding when and how practical activities contribute to student learning. This work has shaped policy discussions, curriculum design, and professional development for science teachers across the United Kingdom and internationally.

## The Rationale for Practical Work

### Historical Context

Practical work has been central to science education since the emergence of laboratory-based instruction in the nineteenth century. The tradition of students conducting experiments themselves developed alongside the professionalisation of science, with the assumption that learning science required engagement with the methods and materials of scientific practice. This assumption has persisted, with practical work retaining a prominent place in science curricula despite periodic challenges to its effectiveness.

### Arguments for Practical Work

Proponents of practical work advance several arguments for its continued prominence in science education:

**Motivation and Engagement:** Many students find practical work more engaging than purely theoretical instruction. The opportunity to handle equipment, observe phenomena directly, and work collaboratively can increase interest in science and improve attitudes toward the subject.

**Understanding Scientific Method:** Practical work is seen as essential for developing students' understanding of how scientific knowledge is produced. Through hands-on investigation, students learn about hypothesis testing, data collection, analysis, and the tentative nature of scientific conclusions.

**Conceptual Understanding:** Well-designed practical work can help students connect abstract concepts to concrete experiences, making complex ideas more accessible and memorable.

**Development of Practical Skills:** Science education aims to develop students' abilities to use scientific equipment safely and effectively, to observe carefully, to record data accurately, and to manipulate materials with precision.

**Preparation for Further Study and Employment:** Practical skills are essential for students who will pursue science at advanced levels or enter science-related careers.

### The Effectiveness Challenge

Despite these arguments, research has consistently shown that practical work is often less effective than assumed. Students may complete practical activities without achieving the intended learning outcomes, particularly when those outcomes relate to conceptual understanding of scientific ideas. The gap between the apparent success of practical work (students often enjoy it and appear engaged) and its actual effectiveness for learning (measured by assessment of intended outcomes) has been termed the "rhetoric-reality gap."

## Millar's Effectiveness Framework

### A Model for Analysing Practical Work

Robin Millar and Ian Abrahams developed a framework for analysing the effectiveness of practical activities based on detailed observation of science lessons and analysis of the learning demands placed on students. Their model distinguishes between different kinds of intended learning outcomes and examines whether the design of practical activities actually supports those outcomes.

The framework identifies that practical activities can be designed to achieve several different kinds of learning outcomes:

**Domain-Specific Knowledge:** Understanding of scientific concepts, principles, theories, and models—what scientists know about the natural world.

**Understanding of Scientific Inquiry:** Knowledge of the methods scientists use to generate and validate knowledge, including experimental design, data analysis, and the nature of scientific evidence.

**Practical Skills and Techniques:** The ability to use scientific equipment and carry out procedures safely and effectively.

The key insight of Millar's framework is that different practical activities are suited to achieving different kinds of outcomes, and effectiveness depends on alignment between the intended outcomes and the design of the activity.

### The Learning Demand of Practical Tasks

A central concept in Millar's framework is the "learning demand" of practical tasks—the cognitive work that students must do to make sense of what they observe and connect it to the intended scientific ideas. Millar distinguishes between:

**Low Learning Demand Tasks:** Activities where the link between observations and concepts is relatively straightforward. Students can see directly what they need to see without significant interpretation. Examples include observing that objects of different materials have different densities, or that metals conduct heat better than non-metals.

**High Learning Demand Tasks:** Activities where students must make significant inferences from observations, or where the phenomena being investigated are not directly observable. Examples include investigations of ionic bonding (where students observe macroscopic properties and must infer microscopic structures) or investigations of abstract concepts like energy conservation.

### Effectiveness Criteria

Millar's framework proposes that practical work is effective when:

1. **The intended learning outcomes are clear** to both teacher and students
2. **The activity design supports those outcomes** rather than working against them
3. **Students have adequate prior knowledge** to make sense of what they observe
4. **The cognitive demand of the task** is appropriate for the students' level of development
5. **Attention is given to connecting observations to concepts**, not just to procedural completion

The framework emphasises that practical work is often ineffective because the learning demand is too high for students to manage independently, or because the activity is poorly aligned with the stated learning objectives.

### Implications for Practice

Millar's research has several important implications for science teaching:

**Be Explicit About Objectives:** Teachers should be clear about what they want students to learn from a practical activity and ensure that the activity design actually supports those objectives.

**Consider Learning Demand:** When planning practical work, teachers should consider whether the inferences required of students are manageable given their prior knowledge. High learning demand activities may require additional scaffolding or direct instruction to be effective.

**Focus on Sense-Making:** Effective practical work includes explicit attention to helping students make sense of their observations and connect them to scientific concepts. This may involve whole-class discussion, written reflection, or follow-up activities that consolidate learning.

**Don't Assume Engagement Equals Learning:** Students may enjoy practical work and appear to be learning without actually achieving the intended conceptual outcomes. Assessment and follow-up are essential to check whether learning has occurred.

## Types of Practical Work

### Classification by Purpose

Practical activities in science can be classified according to their primary purpose:

**Illustrative Practical Work:** Activities designed to demonstrate a scientific principle or phenomenon. These are often teacher-led or highly structured, with the primary goal being to help students see that a particular concept or principle is valid. The emphasis is on observation and linking observations to theoretical ideas.

**Investigative Practical Work:** Activities where students design and carry out their own investigations to answer questions or test hypotheses. These are intended to develop understanding of scientific inquiry methods as well as conceptual understanding. The degree of openness can vary from highly structured investigations to open-ended enquiries.

**Skill-Building Practical Work:** Activities focused primarily on developing proficiency with particular techniques or equipment. These may not have significant conceptual learning objectives but aim to ensure students can use scientific equipment safely and effectively.

**Problem-Solving Practical Work:** Activities where students apply their knowledge to solve practical problems or make decisions based on evidence. These require integration of conceptual understanding and practical skills.

### The Getting Practical Programme

The Getting Practical programme, supported by the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) and led by the University of York, developed and disseminated approaches to improving the effectiveness of practical work based on Millar's research. The programme provided professional development for science teachers focused on:

- Clarifying learning objectives for practical work
- Selecting appropriate types of practical activity for different purposes
- Supporting students in making sense of practical experiences
- Assessing the outcomes of practical work

The programme developed the Practical Activity Analysis Inventory (PAAI), a tool for teachers to analyse the learning demand of practical activities and identify where additional support for student thinking may be needed.

## Safety in Practical Work

### Regulatory Framework

Safety in school science practical work is governed by a combination of health and safety legislation, employer policies, and professional guidance. The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 places duties on employers to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety, and welfare of employees and others affected by their activities. For schools, this means that local authorities or academy trusts have legal responsibility for ensuring safe working practices.

### CLEAPSS: The Consortium of Local Education Authorities for the Provision of Science Services

CLEAPSS is an advisory service providing support for practical science in schools and colleges across the United Kingdom. Founded in 1963, CLEAPSS membership covers the majority of local authorities and academy trusts, representing thousands of schools.

**Services Provided by CLEAPSS:**

**Model Risk Assessments:** CLEAPSS provides model risk assessments for a comprehensive range of practical activities, covering biology, chemistry, and physics. These assessments identify hazards, evaluate risks, and suggest control measures, providing a baseline that schools can adapt to their specific contexts.

**Technical Advice:** CLEAPSS offers advice on equipment, chemicals, and practical procedures, including guidance on sourcing materials, storing chemicals safely, and maintaining equipment.

**Training and Professional Development:** The organisation runs courses for science teachers and technicians, covering safety management, practical procedures, and new developments in practical science.

**Publications:** CLEAPSS produces a range of publications, including the annually updated *CLEAPSS Handbook* and topic-specific guides such as the *CLEAPSS Laboratory Handbook* and guidance on radioactive sources, microbiology, and chemical storage.

**Helpline Support:** Member schools can access telephone and email support for urgent queries about practical work, safety concerns, or equipment issues.

### Key Safety Principles

CLEAPSS and other safety guidance emphasise several key principles for managing safety in practical science:

**Risk Assessment:** All practical activities should be subject to risk assessment that identifies hazards, evaluates risks, and specifies appropriate control measures. This should be done in advance of the activity and should take account of the specific circumstances of the class.

**Competent Supervision:** Students should be supervised by staff who are competent to manage the activity and respond to any incidents. The level of supervision should be appropriate to the risks involved and the competence of the students.

**Suitable Facilities and Equipment:** Practical work should only be carried out in properly equipped laboratories with appropriate safety facilities including eye protection, fire safety equipment, first aid supplies, and adequate ventilation.

**Appropriate Behaviours:** Students must be taught and expected to follow safe working practices including wearing eye protection when required, handling chemicals and equipment appropriately, and following instructions.

**Emergency Preparedness:** Schools should have procedures in place for responding to accidents and emergencies, and staff should know how to implement them.

### Common Hazards in School Science

**Chemical Hazards:** Many school science activities involve chemicals that may be corrosive, toxic, flammable, or environmentally hazardous. CLEAPSS provides guidance on the safe use, storage, and disposal of chemicals, including restrictions on particularly hazardous substances.

**Biological Hazards:** Activities involving microorganisms require attention to containment and aseptic technique to prevent contamination and ensure safe handling. CLEAPSS provides guidance on which organisms are suitable for school use and the conditions under which they can be cultured.

**Physical Hazards:** Physics practical work may involve electrical equipment, radioactive sources, lasers, or mechanical apparatus that presents risks if misused. Guidance covers safe working voltages, appropriate sources for school use, and safe procedures for mechanical investigations.

**Fire and Explosion Risks:** Some chemistry demonstrations and activities involve fire or explosion risks. CLEAPSS guidance specifies safe quantities, precautions, and restrictions on high-risk activities.

## Required Practicals

### GCSE Required Practical Activities

With the introduction of reformed GCSE science qualifications in 2016 (for first teaching 2016-2018), examination boards in England were required to specify a set of practical activities that students must complete as part of their course. These "required practicals" were introduced to ensure that all students experienced a core set of practical work, regardless of which school they attended or which awarding body their school used.

**Structure of Required Practicals:**

GCSE Combined Science includes 16 required practicals (eight for biology, four for chemistry, and four for physics). GCSE Separate Sciences include eight required practicals each for biology, chemistry, and physics, totalling 24 across the three sciences.

**Assessment of Required Practicals:**

While students complete the practical activities themselves, assessment takes place through written examinations rather than direct assessment of practical skills. Examination questions may ask students to:

- Describe methods they have used in required practicals
- Explain why particular methods or equipment were chosen
- Analyse data collected during practical work
- Evaluate the quality of data and suggest improvements
- Apply understanding of practical methods to new contexts

**Purpose of Required Practicals:**

The required practicals were introduced with several aims:

- To ensure minimum entitlement to practical experience for all students
- To reduce the wide variation in practical experiences between schools
- To provide common reference points for assessment
- To support the development of practical skills and understanding of scientific methods

**Criticism and Controversy:**

The introduction of required practicals was controversial. Some educators welcomed the guarantee of practical experience for all students, while others were concerned that:

- Prescribing specific activities might reduce teacher autonomy and professional judgment
- Assessment through written examination might not adequately assess practical skills
- The focus on specific activities might narrow the practical curriculum
- Schools might "teach to the test" by focusing excessively on the required activities

Research by Millar and others has examined whether the required practicals have achieved their intended outcomes and how they are being implemented in schools.

### A Level Required Practicals

A Level science qualifications also include required practical activities, building on the GCSE requirements and reflecting the greater depth of study at advanced level.

**Structure of A Level Required Practicals:**

A Level biology, chemistry, and physics each include 12 required practical activities. These cover a range of techniques and content areas, building on GCSE practical work while introducing more advanced methods.

**Practical Endorsement:**

Unlike GCSE, A Level science includes a separate practical endorsement that directly assesses students' practical skills. Teachers assess students against Common Practical Assessment Criteria (CPAC) across the required practicals and any additional practical work, awarding a pass or fail for practical competence separately from the A Level grade.

The CPAC cover five areas:

1. Follows written procedures
2. Applies investigative approaches and methods when using instruments and equipment
3. Safely uses a range of practical equipment and materials
4. Makes and records observations
5. Researches, references, and reports

Students must demonstrate competence across all five criteria consistently to achieve a pass for the practical endorsement.

**Implications for Teaching:**

The required practicals and practical endorsement have significant implications for A Level science teaching:

- Substantial curriculum time must be allocated to practical work
- Teachers need to track student performance across practical activities
- Assessment of practical skills requires careful planning and documentation
- The practical endorsement may influence university admissions for science courses

## Pedagogical Approaches to Effective Practical Work

### Planning for Learning

Effective practical work begins with clear planning that considers:

**Learning Objectives:** What do I want students to learn from this activity? Is it conceptual understanding, understanding of scientific method, practical skills, or a combination?

**Prior Knowledge:** What do students already need to know to make sense of this practical? Do they have the conceptual foundation to understand what they will observe?

**Activity Design:** Does the activity actually support the intended learning objectives? Is the learning demand appropriate?

**Follow-Up:** How will I help students make sense of what they have observed and connect it to scientific concepts?

### Supporting Sense-Making

Millar's research emphasises that practical work is often ineffective because insufficient attention is given to the crucial step of connecting observations to concepts. Effective approaches include:

**Prediction Activities:** Before carrying out practical work, ask students to predict what they think will happen and explain their reasoning. This activates prior knowledge and creates a need to resolve discrepancies between prediction and observation.

**Structured Observation:** Provide guidance on what to look for during practical work, focusing attention on relevant phenomena rather than allowing observation to be unfocused.

**Whole-Class Discussion:** After practical work, facilitate discussion that helps students interpret their observations and connect them to scientific ideas. This is often where the real learning happens.

**Written Reflection:** Ask students to write about what they observed and what it shows, requiring them to articulate the connection between practical experience and conceptual understanding.

**Representational Work:** Use diagrams, graphs, and models to help students connect concrete observations to abstract concepts.

### Different Types of Practical for Different Purposes

Effective science teaching uses a variety of types of practical work:

**Demonstrations:** Teacher-led demonstrations can be highly effective for showing phenomena that might be difficult for students to observe individually, or that involve safety concerns or expensive equipment. Demonstrations require active student engagement—predicting, observing, explaining—to be effective for learning.

**Structured Practical Work:** Highly structured activities where students follow prescribed methods can be effective for developing specific skills or illustrating particular concepts. The structure ensures that students encounter the intended phenomena.

**Guided Inquiry:** Activities where students have some autonomy in designing investigations but within a structured framework. This can develop understanding of scientific inquiry while providing sufficient support to ensure productive investigation.

**Open Inquiry:** Activities where students generate their own questions and design their own investigations. This is most appropriate when students have developed sufficient inquiry skills and conceptual understanding to work independently.

## Common Misconceptions and Challenges

### Students' Understanding of Practical Work

Research has identified several common misconceptions that students hold about practical work:

**The Recipe Conception:** Many students see practical work as following a recipe to get the right answer, rather than as an investigation of phenomena. This can lead to anxiety when results don't match expectations, or to manipulating data to fit expected outcomes.

**Theory-Practice Separation:** Students may see practical work as disconnected from theoretical learning, failing to recognise that practical activities are designed to illustrate or test scientific concepts.

**The Verification Myth:** Students often think the purpose of practical work is to verify what they already know from theory, rather than to investigate phenomena and potentially discover unexpected results.

### Teacher Challenges

Teachers face several challenges in making practical work effective:

**Time Constraints:** Practical work requires significant curriculum time for preparation, execution, and follow-up. Pressure to cover content can lead to rushed practical activities without adequate sense-making.

**Resource Limitations:** Equipment, chemicals, and facilities may be insufficient or outdated, limiting the range of practical activities that can be carried out effectively.

**Safety Concerns:** Fear of accidents or litigation can lead to overly cautious approaches that limit the range of practical work or make activities so controlled that they lose educational value.

**Assessment Pressures:** When assessment focuses primarily on written examinations, there may be less incentive to invest time in developing practical skills that are not directly assessed.

**Class Size:** Large classes can make practical work difficult to manage safely and can reduce the quality of individual student engagement with practical tasks.

## Conclusion

Practical work remains a central feature of science education, valued by teachers, students, and policymakers alike. However, research by Millar and colleagues has shown that practical work is not automatically effective for learning. The effectiveness of practical activities depends on careful alignment between intended learning outcomes, activity design, and the support provided for students to make sense of their experiences.

The key lessons from research are clear:

- Be explicit about what you want students to learn from practical work
- Consider the learning demand of activities and whether students have adequate prior knowledge
- Focus on sense-making, not just procedural completion
- Use a variety of types of practical work for different purposes
- Attend to safety through proper risk assessment and adherence to CLEAPSS guidance
- Recognise that required practicals provide a minimum entitlement but should not narrow the curriculum

By applying these principles, science teachers can ensure that practical work lives up to its potential as a powerful tool for developing students' scientific understanding, skills, and enthusiasm for the subject.
