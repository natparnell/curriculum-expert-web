# Addressing Scientific Misconceptions: Elicit-Challenge-Restructure and Bridging Analogies

Effective science teaching requires more than delivering accurate information—it demands deliberate strategies for identifying and transforming students' existing misconceptions. This knowledge file explores evidence-based approaches for addressing scientific misconceptions in primary and secondary classrooms, focusing on the elicit-challenge-restructure framework and the strategic use of bridging analogies.

## The Nature and Origins of Scientific Misconceptions

### What Are Misconceptions?

Scientific misconceptions, also termed alternative conceptions or preconceptions, represent ideas held by learners that contradict accepted scientific understanding (Posner, Strike, Hewson and Gertzog, 1982). These are not random errors or lapses in attention; rather, they constitute coherent, internally consistent frameworks that students have constructed to explain their experiences of the world.

Misconceptions differ from simple misunderstandings in several critical ways. They are typically:

- **Resistant to change** through direct instruction or correction
- **Grounded in experience** derived from everyday interactions with the physical world
- **Cross-cultural** and observed consistently across different educational contexts
- **Developmentally persistent**, often re-emerging even after apparent resolution
- **Conceptually coherent** within the learner's existing framework

### Sources of Misconceptions

Understanding the origins of misconceptions helps teachers anticipate and address them systematically. Research identifies several primary sources:

**Everyday Experience and Perception**

Many misconceptions stem directly from how students experience the world. A child observes that objects "naturally" come to rest and concludes that motion requires continuous force—Aristotelian physics that contradicts Newton's first law. The sun appears to move across the sky, supporting geocentric intuitions.

**Language and Everyday Terminology**

Scientific terms often carry different meanings in everyday usage. Students may believe that "heat" is a substance that flows, that "plants get food from the soil," or that "sucking" creates vacuum.

**Instructional Legacy**

Paradoxically, previous teaching can contribute to misconceptions. Simplified models introduced at earlier key stages may become fossilised as students' understanding.

**Cultural and Media Influences**

Television, films and popular media propagate scientific inaccuracies that take root in students' thinking.

### Common Misconceptions by Domain

Research catalogues domain-specific misconceptions across the sciences:

**Physics**: Objects require continuous force to maintain motion; current is "used up" in circuits; heat and cold are different substances.

**Biology**: Plants obtain food from soil rather than manufacturing it; acquired characteristics can be inherited; food chains are linear.

**Chemistry**: Matter is continuous rather than particulate; dissolving is "disappearing"; chemical bonds store energy.

## Theoretical Frameworks for Conceptual Change

### Classical Conceptual Change Theory

Posner, Strike, Hewson and Gertzog (1982) provided the foundational framework for understanding how scientific conceptions replace misconceptions. According to this model, accommodation of a scientific conception requires four conditions:

**Dissatisfaction with Existing Conceptions**: Learners must first experience dissatisfaction with their current ideas. Without this cognitive dissonance, there is no impetus for change.

**Intelligibility of the New Conception**: The scientific conception must be intelligible—learners must be able to grasp what it means.

**Plausibility of the New Conception**: The new conception must appear plausible, capable of explaining the phenomena better than the existing alternative.

**Fruitfulness of the New Conception**: The new conception must prove fruitful—capable of generating new insights, predictions and research questions.

## The Elicit-Challenge-Restructure Framework

Building on conceptual change theory, the elicit-challenge-restructure (ECR) framework provides a practical pedagogical structure for addressing misconceptions in the classroom.

### Phase 1: Elicit

The elicitation phase focuses on surfacing students' existing ideas before formal instruction begins. This diagnostic stage is essential because misconceptions are often invisible to teachers.

**Diagnostic Assessment Strategies**

*Multiple Choice Questions with Distractors*: Diagnostic questions include plausible wrong answers that correspond to common misconceptions. When a significant proportion of students select a particular distractor, the teacher gains immediate insight into prevalent alternative conceptions.

*Predict-Observe-Explain (POE)*: The POE strategy engages students in predicting experimental outcomes, observing actual results and explaining any discrepancies. This creates natural opportunities for misconceptions to surface.

*Concept Cartoons*: Present cartoon characters expressing different viewpoints about a scientific phenomenon. Students select which character they agree with and explain their reasoning.

*Think-Pair-Share*: Structured discussion protocols allow students to externalise thinking before whole-class sharing.

### Phase 2: Challenge

Once misconceptions are elicited, the challenge phase creates cognitive conflict—experiences that demonstrate the inadequacy of existing conceptions.

**Creating Cognitive Conflict**

Cognitive conflict arises when predictions based on existing conceptions prove incorrect. The discrepancy between expectation and observation generates the dissatisfaction necessary for conceptual change.

*Discrepant Events*: Demonstrations producing surprising outcomes challenge expectations directly. A classic example: placing one hand in hot water, the other in cold, then both in lukewarm water produces contradictory temperature perceptions.

*Refutation Texts*: Refutation texts explicitly state common misconceptions, refute them with evidence and present the scientific conception.

*Socratic Questioning*: Skillful questioning can guide students to recognise internal inconsistencies in their thinking.

### Phase 3: Restructure

The restructuring phase supports students in developing and consolidating scientific conceptions.

**Scaffolded Instruction**

Vygotskian scaffolding provides temporary support that enables students to perform beyond their current independent capability. Scaffolds are gradually withdrawn as student competence develops.

**Consolidation and Application**

New conceptions require consolidation through repeated application in diverse contexts. The EEF (2020) recommends checking understanding not only in the original teaching context but also in subsequent topics where the same concepts reappear.

## Bridging Analogies: A Strategic Approach

### The Anatomy of Analogies

An analogy asserts structural correspondence between two domains: the familiar source and the unfamiliar target. Gentner's (1983) structure-mapping theory distinguishes:

- **Attributes**: Surface features that may or may not correspond
- **Relations**: Structural relationships that form the basis of valid analogy
- **Higher-order relations**: Systems of relations that define deeper structure

### Types of Analogies in Science Education

**Simple Analogies** draw direct comparisons between source and target. The atom is like a miniature solar system; DNA is like a recipe.

**Multiple Analogies** present several analogies for the same concept, illuminating different aspects of the target concept.

**Bridging Analogies** create intermediate cases that gradually shift student thinking from misconception to scientific conception.

### Teaching with Analogies: Best Practice

The Analogical Teaching Model (ATM) provides a structured approach:

1. **Introduce the Target Concept**: Establish what students need to learn
2. **Introduce the Analogue**: Present the familiar source domain
3. **Identify Relevant Features**: Explicitly map structural correspondences
4. **Draw Conclusions**: Guide students to apply understanding
5. **Identify Breakdowns**: Crucially, discuss where the analogy breaks down
6. **Summarise and Consolidate**: Summarise the target concept independently

### Pitfalls and Misconceptions from Analogies

Analogies can be double-edged swords. False analogies transmit misunderstanding when structurally flawed. Students may overextend analogies if breakdowns are not explicitly discussed.

## Classroom Implementation

### Planning for Misconceptions

Effective teachers anticipate common misconceptions when planning instruction. The BEST resources from the University of York provide diagnostic questions targeting known misconceptions across topics.

### Responsive Teaching

Diagnostic assessment should inform responsive teaching in real-time. When significant proportions of students hold misconceptions, teachers must adapt instruction accordingly rather than proceeding with planned content.

### Professional Development

Teachers need access to research on common misconceptions in their subject areas. Subject associations, examination board resources and academic journals provide valuable professional learning opportunities.

## Conclusion

Addressing scientific misconceptions requires more than correcting errors—it demands understanding the conceptual frameworks students bring to the classroom, creating conditions for conceptual change, and supporting the construction of scientific understanding. The elicit-challenge-restructure framework and strategic use of bridging analogies provide evidence-based approaches for transforming science education from transmission of facts to genuine conceptual development.

As Ofsted's science subject review (2023) emphasises, identifying misconceptions and addressing them in planning and teaching is essential for effective science education. Teachers who master these approaches enable students to develop robust, transferable scientific understanding that persists beyond the classroom.
