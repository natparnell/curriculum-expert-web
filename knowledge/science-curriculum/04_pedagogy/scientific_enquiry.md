# Scientific Enquiry in Primary Science

## Overview

Scientific enquiry forms the cornerstone of effective primary science education in England. Under the National Curriculum for Science (2014), working scientifically is not taught as a separate strand but is integrated with subject content, developing pupils' understanding of the nature, processes and methods of science through practical activity. The curriculum specifies that pupils should learn to use a variety of approaches to answer relevant scientific questions, commonly referred to as the "five types of enquiry."

## The Five Types of Scientific Enquiry

The National Curriculum implicitly categorises scientific enquiry into five distinct types, each developing different scientific skills and suited to different investigative contexts. Teachers should ensure pupils experience all five types across key stages, progressively developing sophistication in their application.

### 1. Observing Over Time

**Definition and Purpose**

Observing over time involves identifying and measuring events and changes in living things, materials and physical processes or events. This type of enquiry helps pupils recognise patterns of change and understand that some changes occur slowly while others happen rapidly.

**Key Characteristics**

- Involves prolonged observation periods ranging from minutes to months
- Requires systematic recording methods
- Develops understanding of gradual change
- Encourages prediction based on observed patterns

**Primary Applications**

In the primary classroom, observing over time might include:
- Monitoring plant growth from seed to flowering
- Tracking weather patterns and seasonal changes
- Observing the decomposition of materials
- Recording shadow length and position throughout the day
- Monitoring the lifecycle of butterflies or frogs

**Pedagogical Considerations**

Teachers should establish clear observation protocols, including what to record, how frequently to observe, and how to maintain consistency in measurement. Digital photography can support recording, creating visual timelines that make change explicit. Pupils should be encouraged to make predictions about what they expect to observe and to revisit these predictions as evidence accumulates.

**Common Misconceptions**

Primary pupils often struggle with the concept that change can be imperceptibly slow. They may also assume that patterns observed over short periods will continue indefinitely. Teachers should explicitly address the timescales of different natural processes and discuss the limitations of short-term observation.

### 2. Pattern Seeking

**Definition and Purpose**

Pattern seeking involves observing and recording natural events or phenomena, looking for relationships between variables without manipulating them. Unlike fair testing, variables are not controlled; instead, pupils look for correlations in naturally occurring data.

**Key Characteristics**

- Variables are observed but not manipulated
- Requires large sample sizes for reliability
- Focuses on correlation rather than causation
- Develops data analysis and interpretation skills

**Primary Applications**

Pattern seeking enquiries in primary science include:
- Investigating whether taller children have larger feet
- Exploring relationships between leaf size and tree height
- Examining correlations between bird species and habitat features
- Analysing weather data to identify seasonal patterns

**Pedagogical Considerations**

Pattern seeking is often underrepresented in primary science, yet it mirrors how many scientific discoveries are made in authentic contexts. Teachers should emphasise that correlation does not imply causation and discuss alternative explanations for observed patterns. Data representation through scatter graphs and other visual methods helps pupils identify relationships.

**Common Misconceptions**

Pupils frequently confuse pattern seeking with fair testing, attempting to control variables that should be observed naturally. They may also assume that any observed pattern is meaningful, without considering sample size or the possibility of coincidence. Teachers should explicitly teach the distinction between observation and intervention.

### 3. Identifying, Classifying and Grouping

**Definition and Purpose**

This enquiry type involves sorting objects, living things or events into groups based on observable similarities and differences. It develops pupils' abilities to recognise patterns, make comparisons and understand classification systems used in science.

**Key Characteristics**

- Based on observable features
- May use binary or multistage classification keys
- Can involve living or non-living materials
- Develops logical thinking and systematic approaches

**Primary Applications**

Classification activities in primary classrooms include:
- Sorting leaves, seeds or minibeasts using branching keys
- Classifying rocks according to their properties
- Grouping materials by magnetic properties or conductivity
- Creating classification systems for local wildlife

**Pedagogical Considerations**

Teachers should introduce formal classification keys gradually, beginning with simple binary choices before progressing to more complex multistage keys. Pupils should understand that classification systems are human constructs designed to organise knowledge, and that different criteria may be appropriate for different purposes. Discussion of why scientists classify—prediction, communication, understanding relationships—should accompany practical activities.

**Common Misconceptions**

Primary pupils often hold anthropocentric views, classifying organisms according to their relationship to humans rather than shared biological characteristics. They may also assume that all classification systems are fixed and universal, not appreciating that classification evolves as scientific understanding develops. Teachers should explicitly address these conceptual issues.

### 4. Comparative and Fair Testing

**Definition and Purpose**

Comparative and fair testing is the enquiry type most commonly associated with "doing experiments" in primary science. It involves identifying variables, controlling conditions and measuring outcomes to determine causal relationships.

**Key Characteristics**

- One variable is changed (independent variable)
- Other variables are controlled to ensure fairness
- Outcomes are measured (dependent variable)
- Results can indicate causal relationships

**Primary Applications**

Fair testing enquiries include:
- Investigating which material makes the best thermal insulator
- Testing how ramp height affects toy car distance
- Exploring which fertiliser produces the tallest plants
- Determining whether surface texture affects friction

**Pedagogical Considerations**

Fair testing is frequently overemphasised in primary science, sometimes to the exclusion of other enquiry types. While important, teachers should ensure a balanced diet of enquiry approaches. When teaching fair testing, explicit attention to variables is essential: identifying what will be changed, what will be measured, and what must be kept the same. The concept of a "fair test" should be introduced through concrete examples before abstract terminology.

**Variables in Primary Contexts**

Understanding variables represents a significant conceptual challenge for primary pupils:

- **Independent variable**: The factor deliberately changed by the investigator
- **Dependent variable**: The outcome that is measured or observed
- **Control variables**: Factors kept constant to ensure a fair test

Teachers should use consistent terminology and provide plentiful opportunities for pupils to identify variables in familiar contexts before designing their own investigations.

**Common Misconceptions**

Pupils frequently struggle to identify all relevant control variables, often focusing only on the most obvious factors. They may also conflate the concepts of reliability (consistent results) and validity (measuring what was intended). Repeated measurements and discussion of anomalous results help develop understanding of reliability.

### 5. Research Using Secondary Sources

**Definition and Purpose**

Research using secondary sources involves gathering and interpreting information from books, websites, databases and other existing sources rather than conducting primary investigations. This enquiry type is essential for questions that cannot be answered through classroom investigation.

**Key Characteristics**

- Information is gathered from existing sources
- Requires critical evaluation of source reliability
- Enables investigation of large-scale or inaccessible phenomena
- Develops information literacy and synthesis skills

**Primary Applications**

Secondary source research includes:
- Investigating animal adaptations in extreme environments
- Researching the discovery of penicillin or other scientific breakthroughs
- Exploring space exploration and planetary characteristics
- Understanding historical developments in scientific understanding

**Pedagogical Considerations**

Teachers must explicitly teach research skills, including source evaluation, note-taking strategies, and synthesising information from multiple sources. The distinction between reliable scientific sources and less credible information should be addressed, particularly given the prevalence of misinformation online. Pupils should learn to identify authorship, date of publication, and evidence basis when evaluating sources.

**Common Misconceptions**

Primary pupils often treat all printed or digital information as equally reliable. They may also struggle to distinguish between scientific fact, scientific theory, and opinion. Explicit discussion of how scientific knowledge is constructed and validated helps address these misconceptions.

## Planning Investigations

### Developing Investigable Questions

The foundation of any scientific enquiry is a well-formulated question. In primary science, teachers should guide pupils from broad curiosity-driven questions ("Why is the sky blue?") to investigable questions that can be answered through empirical investigation ("How does cloud cover affect temperature?").

**Characteristics of Good Investigable Questions**

- Can be answered through observation or measurement
- Specifies the variables involved
- Is appropriate to pupils' developmental stage
- Can be investigated with available resources
- Has genuine uncertainty (not obviously answerable)

**Strategies for Developing Questions**

Teachers can support question development through:
- Starting with phenomena that provoke curiosity
- Using concept cartoons to surface alternative ideas
- Providing scaffolded question stems ("What happens to... when...?")
- Encouraging pupils to share and refine initial questions

### Planning Frameworks

Providing structure for planning helps pupils consider all elements of a fair test:

**The PICO Framework (adapted for primary)**

- **P**roblem: What are we trying to find out?
- **I**nvestigation: What will we do?
- **C**hange: What will we change?
- **O**bserve: What will we measure?

**The PLAN Framework**

- **P**rediction: What do you think will happen?
- **L**ist variables: What could affect the outcome?
- **A**ll but one: What will you keep the same?
- **N**otice: What will you measure?

These frameworks should be introduced gradually, with heavy scaffolding in early years and increasing independence as pupils progress through key stages.

## Variables in Scientific Enquiry

### Conceptual Development

Understanding variables represents one of the most challenging aspects of working scientifically for primary pupils. Development typically progresses through stages:

**Early Years and Key Stage 1**

- Recognising that things can change
- Identifying simple differences between objects and materials
- Understanding that actions have consequences

**Lower Key Stage 2**

- Distinguishing between things that can be changed and things that change by themselves
- Beginning to recognise that some factors need to stay the same for fair testing
- Using simple comparative language (more than, less than)

**Upper Key Stage 2**

- Using technical vocabulary (independent, dependent, control variables)
- Systematically identifying all relevant variables
- Understanding the relationship between variable control and validity

### Teaching Strategies for Variables

**Concrete Introductions**

Begin with tangible, everyday contexts before introducing abstract concepts. For example, discuss what makes a race fair before discussing fair tests in science.

**Variable Mapping**

Use graphic organisers to identify and categorise variables before planning investigations. This visual approach helps pupils see relationships between factors.

**Focused Assessment**

When pupils struggle with variables, narrow the context. Rather than asking pupils to identify all variables in a complex investigation, focus on one variable type at a time.

**Common Errors and Responses**

| Error | Example | Response Strategy |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Confusing independent and dependent variables | "I changed the distance the car went" | Use sentence stems: "I changed... I measured..." |
| Omitting control variables | Only mentioning the independent variable | Use checklists and prompt cards |
| Treating all changes equally | "I changed the material and the size" | Explicit discussion of fair testing principles |
| Variables not operationalised | "I tested temperature" without specifying how | Require specific measurement descriptions |

## Data Handling in Primary Science

### Collecting Data

**Measurement Skills**

Accurate measurement is foundational to valid data. Primary pupils should develop proficiency with:
- Linear measurement (rulers, tape measures)
- Mass (balances, scales)
- Temperature (thermometers, data loggers)
- Time (stopwatches, timers)
- Volume (measuring cylinders, beakers)

Teachers should provide explicit instruction in measurement techniques, including starting from zero, reading scales at eye level, and understanding measurement uncertainty.

**Recording Methods**

Pupils should encounter and create various recording formats:
- Tables with clear headers and units
- Tally charts for categorical data
- Digital photographs and video
- Annotated drawings and diagrams
- Data logger outputs

### Representing Data

**Appropriate Graph Types by Phase**

**Key Stage 1**
- Pictograms using objects or symbols
- Simple bar charts with 1:1 or 1:2 scales
- Simple tables

**Lower Key Stage 2**
- Bar charts with various scales
- Block diagrams
- Carroll diagrams for classification

**Upper Key Stage 2**
- Line graphs for continuous data
- Scatter graphs for pattern seeking
- Complex tables requiring calculation

**Graphing Conventions**

Teachers should model and require:
- Titles that describe what the graph shows
- Labelled axes with units
- Appropriate scales
- Clear presentation that communicates findings

### Analysing Data

**Describing Patterns**

Pupils should learn to describe data patterns using appropriate language:
- Comparative terms (higher than, lower than, approximately equal)
- Trends (increasing, decreasing, staying the same)
- Relationships (as X increases, Y decreases)
- Anomalies and possible explanations

**Drawing Conclusions**

The relationship between evidence and conclusion should be made explicit. Pupils need support to:
- Refer back to the original question
- Use evidence to support claims
- Distinguish between what the data shows and what they believe
- Recognise the limitations of their evidence
- Identify further questions raised by their findings

## Assessment of Working Scientifically

### Teacher Assessment Framework

The Department for Education's Teacher Assessment Frameworks for science specify expectations for working scientifically at the end of Key Stages 1 and 2. These should inform ongoing assessment rather than being addressed only at key stage endpoints.

**Key Stage 1 Expectations**

Pupils should be able to:
- Ask simple questions and recognise that they can be answered in different ways
- Observe closely, using simple equipment
- Perform simple tests
- Identify and classify
- Use observations and ideas to suggest answers to questions
- Gather and record data to help in answering questions

**Key Stage 2 Expectations**

Pupils should be able to:
- Plan different types of scientific enquiries
- Take measurements with increasing accuracy and precision
- Record data using scientific diagrams, labels, classification keys, tables, scatter graphs, bar and line graphs
- Use test results to make predictions
- Report and present findings from enquiries
- Identify scientific evidence that has been used to support or refute ideas or arguments

### Assessment Strategies

**Focused Observation**

Rather than assessing every aspect of every investigation, teachers should plan focused observations targeting specific working scientifically objectives. This enables detailed assessment without overwhelming documentation.

**Pupil Self-Assessment**

Developing pupils' metacognitive awareness of their enquiry skills supports both learning and assessment. Simple frameworks help pupils reflect on their use of scientific approaches:
- "I asked a question that could be investigated"
- "I kept the test fair"
- "I collected accurate measurements"
- "My conclusion is supported by evidence"

**Recording Assessment**

Working scientifically assessment should capture both the process and the product of enquiry. Photographs, video recordings, and pupil voice interviews complement written records in documenting scientific capability.

## Ofsted and Research Evidence

### Ofsted Research Review Series: Science (2021)

Ofsted's research review emphasised the importance of teaching the substantive knowledge and disciplinary knowledge of science in tandem. Key findings relevant to scientific enquiry include:

**Integration of Knowledge and Enquiry**

Working scientifically should not be taught as a generic set of skills but as inseparable from scientific content knowledge. Pupils need sufficient knowledge of the phenomena under investigation to ask meaningful questions, design appropriate investigations, and interpret results validly.

**The Knowledge-Enquiry Interdependence**

The review highlights that "pupils who know more about the domain they are investigating are able to ask more sophisticated questions, design better investigations and draw more valid conclusions." This challenges approaches that teach "scientific method" as context-free procedural knowledge.

**Practical Work Purpose**

Practical activities should serve clear learning purposes related to disciplinary knowledge development, not merely engagement or illustration. Teachers should be explicit about why particular enquiry approaches are appropriate for particular questions.

### Research on Scientific Enquiry Pedagogy

**The Importance of Explicit Instruction**

Research by Furtak and colleagues (2012) demonstrated that inquiry-based learning is most effective when combined with explicit instruction in scientific reasoning. Pure discovery approaches, where pupils are expected to develop scientific understanding through unguided investigation, show consistently weaker outcomes than guided inquiry with explicit teaching.

**Scaffolded Inquiry**

The "level of inquiry" framework (Herron, 1971; adapted by Bell and colleagues, 2005) identifies four levels:

1. **Confirmation inquiry**: Pupils verify known principles through prescribed procedures
2. **Structured inquiry**: Pupils investigate teacher-presented questions using prescribed procedures
3. **Guided inquiry**: Pupils investigate teacher-presented questions using self-designed procedures
4. **Open inquiry**: Pupils investigate self-generated questions using self-designed procedures

Primary science should move pupils progressively through these levels, with the majority of investigations at the structured or guided levels.

**Developing Scientific Reasoning**

Kuhn and colleagues' research on scientific thinking emphasises the development of metacognitive awareness of the coordination of theory and evidence. Pupils need explicit opportunities to reflect on how evidence relates to claims and to consider alternative explanations for their findings.

## Pedagogical Approaches for Teaching Scientific Enquiry

### The Use of Models and Scaffolds

**Writing Frames**

Structured writing supports help pupils communicate their enquiries:
- Planning templates with sections for prediction, method, results, conclusion
- Conclusion sentence stems ("The evidence shows...", "This supports my prediction because...", "The investigation was fair because...")
- Variable identification tables

These scaffolds should be gradually removed as pupils develop independence, with teachers making deliberate decisions about when pupils are ready for less support.

**Visual Representations**

Diagrams, flowcharts and concept maps help pupils visualise the enquiry process:
- The scientific method as a cycle rather than a linear sequence
- Variable maps showing relationships between factors
- Decision trees for selecting appropriate enquiry types

### Dialogic Teaching in Science Enquiry

**Exploratory Talk**

Mercer and colleagues' research on classroom dialogue emphasises the importance of "exploratory talk" where pupils:
- Share relevant information
- Challenge ideas respectfully
- Provide justifications for claims
- Consider alternative perspectives

Teachers can foster exploratory talk through:
- Ground rules for scientific discussion
- Wait time after questioning
- Prompts that require reasoning ("Why do you think that?", "What evidence supports that view?")
- Opportunities for pupils to respond to each other before teacher evaluation

**Talk Strategies for Enquiry**

Specific talk strategies support scientific reasoning:
- **Predict-explain-observe-explain** (PEOE): Pupils predict and justify before observing, then reconcile predictions with evidence
- **Evidence lines**: Pupils construct arguments using because-but-so structures
- **What would happen if...**: Hypothetical reasoning to explore variable relationships

### Addressing Misconceptions Through Enquiry

**The Role of Cognitive Conflict**

Scientific enquiry can be structured to create productive cognitive conflict when pupils' predictions conflict with observed outcomes. This disequilibrium can motivate conceptual change if:
- The prediction was based on explicit reasoning
- The outcome is unambiguous
- Pupils have opportunity to discuss and resolve the conflict
- Alternative conceptions are explicitly addressed

**Predicting as a Window into Thinking**

Asking pupils to predict before investigating reveals their underlying conceptions. Teachers should value incorrect predictions as diagnostic opportunities, using them to inform subsequent instruction.

## Progression in Working Scientifically

### Early Years Foundation Stage

In the EYFS, science is embedded within Understanding the World. Children should:
- Show curiosity about the natural world
- Make observations using their senses
- Talk about what they notice
- Ask questions about what they observe

Enquiry at this stage is predominantly exploratory and sensory, with adult support to extend noticing and begin systematic observation.

### Key Stage 1 Progression

By the end of Key Stage 1, pupils should:
- Experience all five types of enquiry in simple forms
- Begin to identify obvious variables in fair testing
- Use simple measuring equipment with increasing accuracy
- Record observations in various formats
- Use observations to suggest answers to questions

Teaching should emphasise first-hand experience and clear structures for recording and communicating findings.

### Lower Key Stage 2 Progression

During Years 3 and 4, pupils should:
- Plan investigations with increasing independence
- Use a wider range of measurement techniques
- Begin to consider reliability through repeated measurements
- Represent data in more sophisticated formats
- Draw conclusions that explicitly reference evidence

Introduction of technical vocabulary (variable, fair test, accurate) supports more precise thinking about enquiry.

### Upper Key Stage 2 Progression

By the end of Key Stage 2, pupils should:
- Plan different types of enquiries to answer specific questions
- Select appropriate equipment and techniques
- Control variables systematically in fair tests
- Identify and explain anomalous results
- Evaluate the reliability and validity of their enquiries
- Use scientific language precisely to communicate findings

Enquiries should become increasingly open-ended, with pupils taking greater responsibility for decisions about design and procedure.

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### The Over-Emphasis on Fair Testing

**Challenge**: Many primary classrooms focus disproportionately on fair testing, neglecting other equally important enquiry types.

**Solution**: Audit your curriculum coverage of the five enquiry types. Ensure each is represented proportionally, with pattern seeking and observing over time receiving appropriate attention.

### Insufficient Knowledge for Meaningful Enquiry

**Challenge**: Pupils are asked to investigate phenomena they do not understand sufficiently to ask meaningful questions or interpret results.

**Solution**: Sequence instruction so substantive knowledge precedes enquiry. Teach concepts before asking pupils to investigate them, or use enquiry to develop questions that drive subsequent knowledge acquisition.

### Recording Overload

**Challenge**: Excessive focus on written recording detracts from practical engagement and conceptual learning.

**Solution**: Match recording expectations to purpose. Sometimes annotated photographs, short audio recordings or simple tables suffice. Reserve extended writing for when communication of complex findings is the learning objective.

### Variable Confusion

**Challenge**: Pupils consistently struggle to identify and control variables appropriately.

**Solution**: Use concrete analogies (races, recipes) before scientific contexts. Provide variable identification scaffolds. Focus on one variable type at a time during assessment.

## Cross-Curricular Connections

### Mathematics

Scientific enquiry provides authentic contexts for mathematical learning:
- Measurement and scale reading
- Data handling and statistics
- Ratio and proportion in scaling up investigations
- Graph interpretation and construction

Collaborative planning between science and mathematics coordinators ensures coherent development of these interconnected skills.

### Literacy

Scientific enquiry develops communication skills:
- Information texts and explanations
- Instructional writing for methods
- Discussion and argumentation
- Technical vocabulary development

Writing in science should be explicitly taught, with models and scaffolds specific to scientific genres.

### Computing

Digital technologies enhance scientific enquiry:
- Data loggers for continuous measurement
- Digital microscopes for detailed observation
- Spreadsheets for data analysis
- Presentation software for communicating findings
- Online databases for secondary research

## Conclusion

Scientific enquiry, or working scientifically, is not merely a procedural framework for "doing experiments" but constitutes the disciplinary knowledge of science—the ways of thinking and working that characterise scientific endeavour. Effective teaching of scientific enquiry requires:

- Explicit teaching of the five enquiry types with their distinct purposes
- Integration of enquiry with substantive science knowledge
- Progressive development of skills from structured to more open investigations
- Attention to common misconceptions and conceptual difficulties
- Scaffolded support that is gradually removed as pupils develop independence
- Authentic contexts that demonstrate the purpose and value of scientific approaches

When taught effectively, working scientifically develops pupils' capacity to interrogate the natural world systematically, to evaluate evidence critically, and to communicate findings with precision—capabilities that extend far beyond the science classroom.
