# STEM Links: Cross-Curricular Approaches in Science Education

## Introduction

STEM education—integrating Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics—represents one of the most significant pedagogical shifts in UK education policy and practice over the past decade. While the individual subjects retain their distinct disciplinary identities, the STEM agenda recognises that real-world problems and contemporary careers rarely respect subject boundaries. A climate scientist uses mathematical modelling, computational analysis, and engineering solutions; a medical researcher combines biological knowledge with data science and technological innovation.

For primary and secondary science teachers, understanding how to make meaningful links across the STEM subjects is essential not merely for curriculum compliance but for preparing pupils for the world they will inhabit and shape. This knowledge base entry examines the theoretical foundations of STEM integration, practical approaches to cross-curricular teaching, the specific connections between science and mathematics, the engineering design process as a pedagogical framework, and the growing intersection between science and computing.

## The STEM Agenda in UK Education Policy

### Historical Context

The STEM acronym emerged in the early 2000s from concerns in the United States about workforce preparedness, but it gained rapid traction in UK policy discourse. The Roberts Review (2002) on science, engineering, and technology skills highlighted shortages in technically qualified graduates, whilst the Science and Innovation Investment Framework (2004-2014) established targets for increasing the supply of young people progressing to STEM qualifications.

The Wolf Review of Vocational Education (2011) noted the poor progression rates for students on certain vocational pathways and recommended that all students continue studying mathematics and English post-16 if they had not achieved grade C at GCSE. This recommendation was enacted in the 2013/14 academic year and had profound implications for STEM pathways, ensuring that mathematical competency remained a focus for a larger cohort of students.

More recently, the Industrial Strategy (2017) and subsequent UK Research and Development Roadmap have emphasised STEM skills as foundational to economic competitiveness. The Department for Education's 2021 Skills for Jobs White Paper stressed the importance of employer-led curriculum development in technical education, with STEM fields receiving particular attention through the expansion of Institutes of Technology and the rollout of T Levels.

### Ofsted and STEM

Ofsted's inspection framework has evolved to recognise the importance of cross-curricular learning, though inspectors remain focused on subject-specific quality of education. The 2019 Education Inspection Framework emphasises that inspectors will evaluate how well schools develop pupils' "cultural capital"—the essential knowledge that pupils need to be educated citizens. STEM experiences, including visits, practical work, and exposure to contemporary scientific developments, contribute significantly to this cultural capital.

The Ofsted research review series has provided subject-specific guidance that implicitly supports STEM integration. The science research review (2021) emphasises the importance of disciplinary knowledge alongside substantive content, noting that working scientifically requires mathematical fluency and logical reasoning that pupils develop across subjects. Similarly, the mathematics research review (2021) identifies mathematical reasoning and problem-solving as transferable competencies that support scientific learning.

## Theoretical Frameworks for STEM Integration

### From Silos to Integration

Traditional secondary schooling in England has been characterised by subject silos, with distinct timetables, staffing, and assessment regimes for each discipline. This structure emerged from the 1988 National Curriculum and was reinforced by GCSE specifications, A Levels, and the performance tables that rank schools by subject results. However, this siloed approach creates artificial boundaries that do not reflect how knowledge is created or applied in professional contexts.

STEM integration exists on a continuum from disciplinary (subjects taught separately) to transdisciplinary (subjects fully integrated around authentic problems). Vasquez, Comer, and Schneider (2013) identify four levels of integration:

1. **Disciplinary**: Subjects taught separately, though a concept in one may relate to another
2. **Multidisciplinary**: Subjects taught separately but organised around a common theme
3. **Interdisciplinary**: Concepts and skills from multiple subjects are learned together through intentional connections
4. **Transdisciplinary**: Learners apply knowledge and skills to real-world problems, with subject boundaries dissolving

Effective STEM education in English schools typically operates at the interdisciplinary level, maintaining subject integrity whilst making purposeful connections explicit to pupils.

### Constructivism and STEM Learning

STEM integration aligns with constructivist learning theories that emphasise how learners build understanding through experience and reflection. Papert's constructionism extends constructivism by arguing that learning is most effective when learners are actively creating meaningful products. The engineering design process exemplifies constructionism: pupils define problems, design solutions, build prototypes, and iterate based on testing—learning disciplinary content through the process of creation.

Vygotsky's zone of proximal development is particularly relevant to STEM integration because collaborative problem-solving across disciplines often enables pupils to achieve more than they could individually. A pupil strong in mathematics but weaker in written communication might contribute quantitative analysis to a group STEM project, whilst benefiting from peers' strengths in research and presentation.

### Situated Cognition

Situated cognition theory posits that learning is fundamentally tied to context and activity. STEM integration attempts to make school learning more authentic by embedding it in contexts that mirror professional practice. When pupils engage in citizen science projects, engineer solutions to local environmental problems, or code sensors to collect environmental data, they are learning in contexts that resemble how STEM professionals actually work.

This situated approach addresses a persistent criticism of school science: that it presents a distorted image of scientific practice. The Science and Technology Select Committee's 2012 report noted that practical science in schools often bore little relation to authentic scientific inquiry. STEM integration, particularly through extended projects and engineering challenges, can restore some of that authenticity.

## Science-Mathematics Connections

### The Nature of the Relationship

Science and mathematics share a symbiotic relationship that has deep historical roots. Galileo's observation that the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics remains as true today as in the seventeenth century. Yet in schools, these subjects often proceed in parallel with insufficient attention to their interdependence.

The relationship operates in both directions:

**Mathematics in the service of science**: Scientists use mathematical tools to describe patterns, analyse data, and model phenomena. Without mathematical fluency, pupils cannot engage with quantitative scientific concepts. Understanding rate of reaction in chemistry requires grasp of gradients and rates of change. Comprehending genetic ratios demands probability theory. Interpreting force diagrams involves vector addition.

**Science providing context for mathematics**: Conversely, science provides authentic contexts for mathematical learning. The Royal Society's 2019 report on mathematics education noted that pupils often struggle to see the relevance of abstract mathematical procedures. Science investigations offer meaningful contexts for applying mathematical techniques—from calculating means and ranges to using proportional reasoning in dosage calculations.

### Key Stage Specific Connections

#### Key Stage 1 and 2

At primary level, science and mathematics are naturally intertwined through measurement and data handling. The National Curriculum for Science requires pupils to:
- Take accurate measurements using standard units
- Record findings using simple scientific language, drawings, labelled diagrams, and tables
- Use results to draw simple conclusions

These requirements depend on mathematical competencies developed in the mathematics curriculum: understanding standard units, reading scales, constructing and interpreting simple tables and charts, and calculating with whole numbers and simple fractions.

Practical integration at this level might include:
- Measuring plant growth over time and constructing line graphs
- Timing how long ice takes to melt under different conditions and comparing durations
- Classifying living things using branching databases that require logical sorting
- Constructing 3D models of the solar system to scale, requiring proportional reasoning

The Nuffield Primary Science resources and the Centre for Innovation in Mathematics Teaching (CIMT) materials provide well-designed activities that naturally integrate these subjects.

#### Key Stage 3

The KS3 science curriculum introduces more sophisticated quantitative concepts that depend on mathematical foundations:

**Speed and acceleration**: Understanding velocity-time graphs requires interpreting gradients and areas under curves—concepts introduced in the KS3 mathematics curriculum but often not fully consolidated until KS4.

**Density and pressure**: These compound quantities (mass/volume and force/area) require understanding of proportional reasoning and algebraic manipulation that may not be fully developed in all pupils at this stage.

**Chemical formulae and equations**: Balancing chemical equations demands conservation of quantity and algebraic thinking. Calculating reacting masses requires proportional reasoning and confidence with fractions and decimals.

**Genetics and probability**: The Punnett square, whilst often taught procedurally, is fundamentally a probability tool. Understanding why a 3:1 ratio is expected but may not be observed in small samples requires grasp of sample size and random variation.

Effective teaching at this stage requires communication between science and mathematics departments. The Mathematics in Education and Industry (MEI) organisation and the Association for Science Education (ASE) have collaborated on resources that map mathematical requirements against science content, enabling teachers to identify where pupils may need additional mathematical support.

#### Key Stage 4 and A Level

At GCSE and A Level, the mathematical demands of science increase substantially. The 2015 reforms to GCSE science introduced required practicals with explicit assessment of mathematical skills, including:
- Arithmetic and numerical computation
- Handling data (including means, ranges, uncertainty, and simple statistical testing)
- Algebra (including rearranging equations and solving simple simultaneous equations)
- Graphs (including gradients, intercepts, and area under curves)
- Geometry and trigonometry

Biology A Level includes statistical testing (chi-squared, Student's t-test, correlation coefficients) that many students have not encountered in their mathematics GCSE. Chemistry A Level involves complex stoichiometry calculations and logarithmic relationships in pH calculations. Physics A Level is essentially applied mathematics, with calculus becoming essential at the highest levels.

The 2013 Ofqual reforms to A Level mathematics introduced optional applied modules, with many students now studying only mechanics or statistics rather than both. This creates challenges for university STEM admissions, as physics and engineering applicants may lack statistics whilst biology and psychology applicants may lack mechanics.

### Teaching Strategies for Science-Mathematics Integration

**Explicitly teach mathematical procedures in scientific context**: Rather than assuming pupils can transfer mathematical skills to science, explicitly model how scientists use these techniques. Demonstrate how to rearrange equations using physical quantities (F=ma becomes a=F/m) rather than abstract variables.

**Use consistent language and notation**: Misalignment between mathematics and science departments causes confusion. Is it "gradient" or "rate of change"? Does "significant figure" mean the same in both contexts? Establishing shared conventions across departments reduces cognitive load for pupils.

**Address misconceptions about measurement**: Pupils often believe that measurement is about finding the "right" answer rather than estimating within bounds of uncertainty. Explicitly teaching error bars, ranges, and confidence intervals develops scientific literacy alongside mathematical understanding.

**Leverage graphing software and data loggers**: Digital tools can reduce the mechanical burden of graphing, allowing pupils to focus on interpretation. However, ensure pupils still develop manual graphing skills, as this builds understanding of scale, proportion, and the relationship between algebraic and graphical representations.

**Use peer tutoring between mathematics and science**: Pairing mathematics specialists with science specialists for team-teaching can model the integration of these disciplines for pupils and support professional development for teachers.

## The Engineering Design Process

### Engineering in the National Curriculum

Engineering has an ambiguous status in English schools. It does not appear as a discrete subject in the National Curriculum, yet it is woven throughout the Design and Technology (D&T) programmes of study and provides a pedagogical framework for science investigation. The 2014 D&T curriculum explicitly requires pupils to engage in iterative design processes, and the Association for Science Education (ASE) has promoted engineering contexts as authentic applications of scientific knowledge.

The EngineeringUK organisation notes that engineering is essentially the application of scientific and mathematical principles to practical problems. This definition highlights why engineering contexts are so valuable for STEM integration: they demand the application of knowledge from multiple disciplines.

### The Engineering Design Process as Pedagogy

The engineering design process (EDP) provides a structured framework for problem-solving that can be applied across age ranges and contexts. Whilst various models exist, most share common phases:

#### 1. Define the Problem

Pupils identify a problem or need, ideally through authentic contexts. This might be a local issue (designing a sustainable drainage system for the school field), a user-centred challenge (creating an accessible watering can for elderly gardeners), or a broader societal problem (developing a low-cost water filtration system for communities without clean water access).

Effective problem definition requires research and empathy. Pupils must understand constraints (materials available, time, cost) and criteria for success. This phase develops research skills and the ability to translate open-ended challenges into specific, actionable briefs.

#### 2. Research and Ideate

Pupils investigate existing solutions, scientific principles relevant to the problem, and potential approaches. This phase explicitly integrates disciplinary knowledge: understanding the science behind filtration, the mathematics of structural load-bearing, or the technology of sensor systems.

Ideation involves generating multiple possible solutions without premature judgment. Techniques like brainstorming, mind-mapping, and SCAMPER (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse) can expand pupils' thinking beyond obvious solutions.

#### 3. Design and Plan

Pupils select a promising solution and develop detailed designs. At primary level, this might involve annotated drawings and simple material lists. At secondary level, pupils might produce technical drawings, CAD models, Gantt charts for project management, and detailed costings.

This phase requires applying mathematical skills (measurement, scale, calculation of quantities) and scientific understanding (materials properties, forces, energy transfers). It also develops planning and project management competencies valuable beyond STEM contexts.

#### 4. Build a Prototype

Pupils construct a working model of their design. This hands-on phase is where abstract plans meet material reality. Pupils learn that designs that work "on paper" may require modification when built, developing understanding of tolerances, material behaviour, and practical constraints.

Safety and sustainability considerations should be explicit at this stage. Pupils learn to risk-assess practical work and consider the environmental impact of material choices.

#### 5. Test and Evaluate

Pupils systematically test their prototypes against the success criteria established in the problem definition phase. This requires designing fair tests, collecting data, and analysing results—applying working scientifically skills in an authentic context.

Evaluation goes beyond simple success or failure. Pupils consider trade-offs: the strongest structure may be too expensive; the most efficient design may be too complex to manufacture. This develops understanding of optimisation and the compromises inherent in real engineering.

#### 6. Iterate

The EDP is explicitly cyclical. Testing informs redesign, and the process repeats until the solution meets criteria or constraints require accepting a "good enough" outcome. This iteration models how real engineering works and builds resilience, normalising failure as a learning opportunity rather than a final outcome.

### Engineering Contexts Across Key Stages

**Primary Examples**:
- Building bridges to span a specific gap using limited materials (introducing structural engineering and material properties)
- Designing seed dispersal mechanisms inspired by nature (biomimicry and understanding plant reproduction)
- Creating simple machines to move objects (levers, pulleys, and mechanical advantage)

**Key Stage 3 Examples**:
- Designing, building, and testing model wind turbines (energy transfer, electrical generation, optimisation)
- Creating water rockets and analysing flight data (forces, pressure, data collection and analysis)
- Developing apps or physical computing solutions using micro:bit (computing and electronics integration)

**Key Stage 4 and A Level Examples**:
- Extended engineering projects using the Arkwright Scholarship framework
- Designing sustainable building models incorporating passive heating/cooling (thermodynamics, material science, environmental science)
- Developing assistive technology solutions for real users (user-centred design, electronics, programming)

### The Royal Academy of Engineering and Educational Resources

The Royal Academy of Engineering provides extensive resources for schools through its "Engineering in Schools" programme. These include:
- **Engineering in the Movies**: Using film clips to explore engineering principles
- **Deploying Design**: Resources linked to real engineering projects
- **This is Engineering**: Campaign materials profiling diverse engineers

The Academy's "Engineering Habits of Mind" framework identifies six characteristics that define engineering thinking: systems thinking, problem-finding, visualising, improving, creative problem-solving, and adapting. These habits provide a language for talking about engineering across subjects and age groups.

## Science and Computing Links

### The Rise of Computing in Schools

The 2014 replacement of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) with Computing as a National Curriculum subject marked a significant shift. Where ICT focused on digital literacy—using software packages—Computing emphasises computer science principles: algorithms, programming, data structures, and digital systems. This shift creates new opportunities for science-computing integration.

The Computing curriculum includes explicit requirements that support scientific learning:
- Collecting, analysing, evaluating and presenting data (linking to science data handling)
- Using logical reasoning to explain how simple algorithms work (supporting scientific reasoning)
- Using search technologies effectively (research skills for scientific inquiry)
- Selecting, using and combining a variety of software to design and create programs that accomplish given goals

At Key Stage 3, pupils must "undertake creative projects that involve selecting, using, and combining multiple applications...to achieve challenging goals." This requirement enables extended projects that combine scientific data collection with computational analysis and presentation.

### Computational Thinking in Science

Computational thinking—defined by Wing (2006) as the thought processes involved in formulating problems and their solutions so that the solutions can be carried out by a computer—has significant overlap with scientific reasoning. Both involve:

**Decomposition**: Breaking complex problems into manageable parts. In science, this might mean separating variables in a multi-factor investigation. In computing, it means breaking programs into functions or modules.

**Pattern recognition**: Identifying regularities in data. Scientists look for trends in experimental results; computing involves recognising patterns that can be abstracted into algorithms.

**Abstraction**: Focusing on essential features whilst ignoring irrelevant detail. Scientists create models that simplify complex phenomena; programmers use abstraction to manage complexity through functions and data structures.

**Algorithm design**: Creating step-by-step solutions. Experimental procedures are algorithms; so are computer programs.

Teaching these parallels explicitly helps pupils see computing and science as related intellectual endeavours rather than disconnected subjects.

### Programming for Scientific Investigation

Programming tools enable pupils to engage with scientific concepts in ways that would be impossible without computational support:

**Data logging and sensors**: Microcontrollers like the micro:bit, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino can be programmed to collect data from sensors (temperature, light, sound, acceleration) over time periods or at frequencies that would be impractical manually. Pupils write code to collect data, then analyse the results using spreadsheets or programming environments.

**Simulation and modelling**: Programming environments like Python, Scratch, or NetLogo enable pupils to create simulations of scientific phenomena that would be too slow, fast, dangerous, or expensive to observe directly. Examples include:
- Predator-prey population dynamics in ecology
- Natural selection and evolution over many generations
- Climate models and feedback loops
- Particle behaviour in different states of matter

**Data analysis and visualisation**: Python libraries (matplotlib, pandas) and spreadsheet tools enable sophisticated analysis of datasets larger than pupils could process manually. Citizens science projects like Globe Observer or Zooniverse provide authentic datasets for pupils to analyse using computational tools.

**Citizen science participation**: Platforms like iNaturalist, eBird, and Foldit enable pupils to contribute real scientific data whilst developing computing skills through data entry, mapping, and analysis.

### Physical Computing in Science

Physical computing—the integration of hardware and software—provides particularly rich opportunities for science-computing integration:

**The micro:bit** in the BBC's educational programme provides an accessible entry point. Pupils can program the device to:
- Measure and log temperature, light, or acceleration data
- Create simple environmental monitoring stations
- Build reaction time testers for biology investigations
- Develop step counters or fitness trackers

**Raspberry Pi** extends these capabilities for older pupils, enabling:
- Weather stations with multiple sensors
- Time-lapse photography for biology observations
- Automated plant watering systems
- Data collection from physics experiments

**Arduino** and similar microcontrollers support more advanced projects where pupils need precise control over hardware, such as:
- Spectrometers for chemistry analysis
- Robotics for engineering projects
- Custom data loggers for field work

These tools position pupils as creators of scientific instrumentation rather than passive consumers of laboratory equipment, deepening their understanding of how scientific data is produced.

## Assessment and Progression in STEM Integration

### Challenges in Assessing Integrated Learning

Assessment has historically posed challenges for STEM integration. GCSEs, A Levels, and most standardised tests assess subjects separately. A pupil might demonstrate excellent interdisciplinary thinking in a project but struggle to show this capability in a subject-specific examination.

This assessment challenge creates a tension for teachers: whilst they may value integrated STEM experiences, they are accountable for subject-specific outcomes. The risk is that STEM integration becomes marginalised as enrichment rather than core curriculum.

### Strategies for Assessing STEM Learning

**Portfolio assessment**: Extended STEM projects can be assessed through portfolios that document the process from problem definition through iteration. The CREST Awards (British Science Association) provide a recognised framework for assessing project-based STEM work at Bronze, Silver, and Gold levels.

**Cross-curricular projects with subject-specific assessment**: Projects can be designed so that different aspects are assessed through different subjects. An engineering project might assess the science content through science assessment, the mathematical modelling through mathematics assessment, and the design process through D&T assessment.

**Explicit assessment of STEM competencies**: Schools can develop rubrics that assess STEM-specific skills: interdisciplinary thinking, systems thinking, design iteration, and collaborative problem-solving. These can be reported alongside subject grades to give a fuller picture of pupil achievement.

**Practical endorsement**: The A Level science practical endorsement already assesses competencies that span disciplines. Extending this approach to recognise explicitly interdisciplinary work could support STEM integration at sixth form level.

### Progression in STEM Integration

Progression in STEM integration should mirror progression in individual subjects—from concrete to abstract, from guided to independent, from simple to complex:

**Primary**: STEM integration happens naturally through topics and investigations. Pupils should experience simple engineering challenges and use basic programming tools to collect data, but the focus is on exploration rather than formal disciplinary knowledge.

**Key Stage 3**: Pupils should engage in more structured engineering design challenges, make explicit connections between science and mathematics content, and use programming as a tool for investigation. The goal is developing fluency in moving between disciplinary perspectives.

**Key Stage 4**: Extended projects become more sophisticated, with pupils taking greater ownership of problem definition and solution development. GCSE specifications increasingly allow for integrated assessment through the required practicals and controlled assessments.

**Post-16**: STEM integration prepares pupils for the reality of higher education and careers. EPQs (Extended Project Qualifications), CREST Gold Awards, and the Arkwright Scholarship programme provide frameworks for sophisticated interdisciplinary work.

## Resources and Organisations Supporting STEM Integration

### Professional Associations

**The Association for Science Education (ASE)** provides resources, professional development, and networks that support science teaching across all phases. Their annual conference includes sessions on STEM integration and cross-curricular working.

**The Mathematical Association (MA)** and **Association of Teachers of Mathematics (ATM)** offer resources and professional development that connect mathematics to real-world contexts, including scientific applications.

**Computing at School (CAS)** is the subject association for computing teachers, providing resources and training on physical computing, data science, and computational thinking.

**The Design and Technology Association (DATA)** provides resources on the engineering design process and practical projects that integrate D&T with science and mathematics.

### External Programmes and Competitions

**The CREST Awards** (British Science Association) provide a framework for pupil-led project work at Bronze, Silver, and Gold levels, recognised by universities and employers.

**The Arkwright Scholarship** programme supports high-ability pupils pursuing engineering through sixth form, providing mentoring, funding, and networking opportunities.

**The Engineering Development Trust (EDT)** offers programmes linking industry with schools, including the Industrial Cadets framework.

**The National Centre for Computing Education (NCCE)** provides resources, training, and certification for computing teachers, including content on physical computing and data science.

**The Isaac Physics** and **Isaac Computer Science** platforms provide free resources and problem-solving practice for A Level students, with explicit attention to mathematical and computational applications.

**PhET simulations** (University of Colorado) provide interactive simulations of scientific phenomena that can be used to explore concepts before or alongside practical work.

## Conclusion

STEM integration is not merely a matter of curriculum organisation—it represents a fundamental shift in how we conceptualise the relationship between school subjects and the world beyond the classroom. Real problems do not arrive labelled by subject; they demand flexible application of knowledge from multiple domains.

For science teachers, the STEM agenda offers opportunities to make their subject more relevant, more engaging, and more authentic. When pupils see how scientific knowledge connects to engineering challenges, mathematical analysis, and computational tools, they develop a richer understanding of what science is and what it can accomplish.

Effective STEM integration requires:
- **Curriculum time** for extended projects that cannot be squeezed into single lessons
- **Collaboration** between subject departments to identify connections and share expertise
- **Professional development** so teachers can confidently teach outside their specialism
- **Resources** including physical computing equipment, engineering materials, and software
- **Assessment approaches** that recognise and value interdisciplinary competencies

The investment is substantial, but so is the potential return. Pupils who experience well-designed STEM education develop not just disciplinary knowledge but the capacity to integrate, apply, and adapt that knowledge to novel situations—the very capabilities they will need to address the challenges of the twenty-first century.
