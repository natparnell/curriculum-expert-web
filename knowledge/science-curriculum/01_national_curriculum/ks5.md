# Key Stage 5 Science: A Level Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of Key Stage 5 science education in England, covering A Level Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. It addresses the statutory subject criteria established by the Department for Education (DfE) and the regulatory requirements set by Ofqual, including the practical endorsement that forms a compulsory component of all A Level science qualifications.

## 1. Regulatory Framework and Subject Criteria

### 1.1 DfE Subject Content Requirements (2014)

The current A Level science specifications, first taught from September 2015, are built upon the GCE AS and A Level Subject Content for Biology, Chemistry and Physics published by the Department for Education in April 2014. This document establishes the minimum knowledge, understanding, and skills required for all AS and A Level specifications in these subjects, regardless of awarding body.

The DfE subject content is organised to ensure that all students develop:

- **Subject knowledge**: A deep understanding of core concepts, principles, and theories within each scientific discipline
- **Scientific thinking**: The ability to analyse, interpret, and evaluate scientific information and methodology
- **Practical skills**: Competency in laboratory techniques and experimental design
- **Mathematical proficiency**: Application of mathematical skills appropriate to each science (minimum 10% biology, 20% chemistry, 40% physics)
- **Scientific literacy**: The capacity to communicate scientific ideas effectively and understand their social and ethical implications

### 1.2 Ofqual Regulatory Requirements

Ofqual, as the qualifications regulator, establishes the conditions and requirements that awarding organisations must meet when developing and delivering A Level science qualifications. These include:

- **Content coverage**: Specifications must cover all content defined in the DfE subject content document
- **Assessment structure**: Three written papers at A Level (plus the practical endorsement)
- **Question types**: A range including multiple choice, short answer, long answer, calculations, and extended writing
- **Practical endorsement**: A separate Pass/Unclassified grade reported alongside the A*-E grade

The Ofqual subject-level conditions ensure consistency and comparability across different awarding bodies (AQA, Edexcel, OCR, WJEC/Eduqas) while allowing sufficient flexibility for distinctive pedagogical approaches.

## 5. The Practical Endorsement

### 5.1 Overview

The A Level Science Practical Endorsement is a formal requirement for all A Level Biology, Chemistry, and Physics qualifications in England. Introduced with the 2015 specifications, it represents a significant reform in how practical skills are assessed and reported.

**Key characteristics:**

- Awarded as a separate Pass or Unclassified grade
- Reported alongside the A*-E grade on certificates
- Requires demonstration of competency across five Common Practical Assessment Criteria (CPAC)
- Based on teacher observation and assessment of students completing at least 12 practical activities
- Not assessed through written examination (though written papers assess practical knowledge)

### 5.2 Common Practical Assessment Criteria (CPAC)

Ofqual has established five CPAC that students must meet consistently to achieve a Pass in the practical endorsement:

**CPAC 1: Follows Written Procedures**
- Correctly follows instructions to carry out experimental techniques or procedures
- Works safely and methodically
- Identifies and uses appropriate apparatus

**CPAC 2: Applies Investigative Approaches and Methods**
- Applies investigative approaches and methods when using instruments and equipment
- Identifies variables and controls where appropriate
- Makes decisions about measurements and observations

**CPAC 3: Safely Uses a Range of Practical Equipment and Materials**
- Uses equipment safely and methodically
- Applies appropriate techniques for handling apparatus and materials
- Minimises risks to themselves and others

**CPAC 4: Makes and Records Observations**
- Makes accurate observations relevant to the experimental procedure
- Records observations appropriately using tables or other suitable formats
- Records measurements with appropriate units and precision

**CPAC 5: Researches, References and Reports**
- Researches and identifies relevant sources of information
- Reports findings using appropriate scientific vocabulary and conventions
- References sources appropriately
- Identifies sources of error and uncertainty
- Evaluates methods and suggests improvements

### 5.3 Monitoring and Quality Assurance

The practical endorsement is subject to external monitoring by awarding organisations. This typically involves:

- Monitoring visits to centres (usually once every two years)
- Review of records and evidence of student competency
- Observation of practical activities
- Verification of teacher assessment decisions

Centres must retain records including:

- Tracking documents showing which CPAC each student has demonstrated and when
- Evidence of student work (written records, data, observations)
- Centre-designed or adapted practical activities
- Head teacher declaration form confirming completion of requirements

The deadline for submission of the Head teacher declaration form is typically 15 May of the examination year.

## 6. Assessment Structure and Progression

### 6.1 AS Level Assessment

AS Level is a standalone qualification representing the first year of A Level study. It consists of:

- **Two written papers** covering the AS content (typically 50% each)
- **No practical endorsement** required (though practical work is expected)
- **Grades A-E** awarded

Note: AS results do not contribute to the A Level grade; the A Level is a linear qualification examined at the end of the two-year course.

### 6.2 A Level Assessment

The full A Level qualification comprises:

- **Three written papers** covering all content (AS and A Level)
- **Practical endorsement** (Pass/Unclassified)
- **Grades A*-E** for the written component

**Typical paper structure (AQA):**

- Paper 1: Short and long answer questions, including multiple choice, covering first year content plus relevant practical skills
- Paper 2: Short and long answer questions, including multiple choice, covering second year content plus relevant practical skills
- Paper 3: Structured questions including practical techniques, critical analysis of experimental data, and extended response synoptic questions

### 6.3 Progression and Higher Education

A Level sciences are gateway qualifications for numerous higher education pathways:

- **Biology**: Medicine, dentistry, veterinary science, biochemistry, biomedical sciences, pharmacy, nursing, environmental science
- **Chemistry**: Chemistry, chemical engineering, biochemistry, medicine, pharmacy, materials science, forensic science
- **Physics**: Physics, engineering (all branches), astrophysics, computer science, mathematics, medicine

The Russell Group of universities identifies A Level sciences as "facilitating subjects" that provide the widest range of options for university study.

## 7. Pedagogical Approaches in KS5 Science

### 7.1 Teaching the Practical Endorsement

Effective delivery of the practical endorsement requires:

- **Integration with theory**: Practical work should reinforce conceptual understanding, not be an add-on
- **Progressive skill development**: Students need multiple opportunities to develop competency before assessment
- **Authentic investigations**: Include open-ended enquiries alongside recipe-following activities
- **CPAC mapping**: Clear documentation of when and how each student meets each criterion
- **Digital portfolios**: Electronic systems for tracking and evidencing competency

### 7.2 Addressing Mathematical Requirements

Given the significant mathematical demands (especially in physics at 40%), effective teaching includes:

- **Pre-teaching mathematical skills** before application in science contexts
- **Explicit modelling** of calculations, including showing full working
- **Regular practice** with past paper mathematical questions
- **Graph-drawing skills** taught explicitly
