# Key Stage 2 Science: Statutory Content and Teaching Guidance

## Introduction to KS2 Science

Key Stage 2 (Years 3-6) represents a crucial developmental phase in children's science education. The National Curriculum for science at KS2 is structured to build upon the foundations established at KS1, broadening and deepening pupils' scientific understanding while developing their capacity to work scientifically in increasingly sophisticated ways.

The KS2 science curriculum is divided into two distinct phases: Lower Key Stage 2 (Years 3 and 4) and Upper Key Stage 2 (Years 5 and 6). Each phase has specific principal focuses that reflect the developing cognitive abilities of pupils. The curriculum covers biology (plants, animals including humans, living things and their habitats), chemistry (states of matter, properties and changes of materials), and physics (light, forces and magnets, sound, electricity, Earth and space).

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the statutory content, working scientifically progression, pedagogical approaches, and common misconceptions associated with KS2 science education.

## Principal Focus and Structure

### Lower Key Stage 2 (Years 3 and 4)

The principal focus of science teaching in lower key stage 2 is to enable pupils to broaden their scientific view of the world around them. They should do this through exploring, talking about, testing and developing ideas about everyday phenomena and the relationships between living things and familiar environments, and by beginning to develop their ideas about functions, relationships and interactions.

At this stage, pupils should:
- Ask their own questions about what they observe
- Make some decisions about which types of scientific enquiry are likely to be the best ways of answering them
- Draw simple conclusions and use some scientific language
- Begin to use scientific language to write about what they have found out

### Upper Key Stage 2 (Years 5 and 6)

The principal focus of science teaching in upper key stage 2 is to enable pupils to develop a deeper understanding of a wide range of scientific ideas. They should do this through exploring and talking about their ideas; asking their own questions about scientific phenomena; and analysing functions, relationships and interactions more systematically.

At this stage, pupils should:
- Encounter more abstract ideas and begin to recognise how these ideas help them to understand and predict how the world operates
- Recognise that scientific ideas change and develop over time
- Select the most appropriate ways to answer science questions using different types of scientific enquiry
- Draw conclusions based on their data and observations
- Use evidence to justify their ideas
- Use their scientific knowledge and understanding to explain their findings

## Working Scientifically at KS2

### Lower KS2 Working Scientifically (Years 3 and 4)

During years 3 and 4, pupils should be taught to use the following practical scientific methods, processes and skills through the teaching of the programme of study content:

- Asking relevant questions and using different types of scientific enquiries to answer them
- Setting up simple practical enquiries, comparative and fair tests
- Making systematic and careful observations and, where appropriate, taking accurate measurements using standard units, using a range of equipment, including thermometers and data loggers
- Gathering, recording, classifying and presenting data in a variety of ways to help in answering questions
- Recording findings using simple scientific language, drawings, labelled diagrams, keys, bar charts, and tables
- Reporting on findings from enquiries, including oral and written explanations, displays or presentations of results and conclusions
- Using results to draw simple conclusions, make predictions for new values, suggest improvements and raise further questions
- Identifying differences, similarities or changes related to simple scientific ideas and processes
- Using straightforward scientific evidence to answer questions or to support their findings

### Upper KS2 Working Scientifically (Years 5 and 6)

During years 5 and 6, pupils should be taught to use the following practical scientific methods, processes and skills:

- Planning different types of scientific enquiries to answer questions, including recognising and controlling variables where necessary
- Taking measurements, using a range of scientific equipment, with increasing accuracy and precision, taking repeat readings when appropriate
- Recording data and results of increasing complexity using scientific diagrams and labels, classification keys, tables, scatter graphs, bar and line graphs
- Using test results to make predictions to set up further comparative and fair tests
- Reporting and presenting findings from enquiries, including conclusions, causal relationships and explanations of and a degree of trust in results, in oral and written forms such as displays and other presentations
- Identifying scientific evidence that has been used to support or refute ideas or arguments

### Progression in Working Scientifically

The progression from Lower to Upper KS2 reflects the increasing sophistication of pupils' scientific capabilities:

| Aspect | Lower KS2 (Years 3-4) | Upper KS2 (Years 5-6) |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Questioning | Ask relevant questions | Explore ideas and raise different kinds of questions |
| Enquiry design | Set up simple enquiries | Plan different types of enquiries, recognising and controlling variables |
| Measurement | Take accurate measurements using standard units | Take measurements with increasing accuracy and precision; take repeat readings |
| Data recording | Use simple tables, bar charts, diagrams | Use tables, scatter graphs, bar and line graphs; increasing complexity |
| Analysis | Draw simple conclusions | Identify causal relationships; assess degree of trust in results |
| Evidence | Use straightforward evidence | Identify evidence that supports or refutes arguments |
| Communication | Oral and written explanations | Conclusions, causal relationships, explanations; discuss how ideas develop over time |

- Materials can change state when heated or cooled (melting, freezing, evaporating, condensing)
- Temperature is measured in degrees Celsius
- The water cycle involves evaporation, condensation, and precipitation
- The rate of evaporation is affected by temperature

**Note:** Teachers should avoid using materials where heating is associated with chemical change (baking, burning) as this can confuse pupils about the difference between physical and chemical changes.

- Know that some materials will dissolve in liquid to form a solution, and describe how to recover a substance from a solution
- Use knowledge of solids, liquids and gases to decide how mixtures might be separated, including through filtering, sieving and evaporating
- Give reasons, based on evidence from comparative and fair tests, for the particular uses of everyday materials, including metals, wood and plastic
- Demonstrate that dissolving, mixing and changes of state are reversible changes
- Explain that some changes result in the formation of new materials, and that this kind of change is not usually reversible, including changes associated with burning and the action of acid on bicarbonate of soda

**Key Concepts and Teaching Approaches:**

This is a substantial topic that develops pupils' understanding of materials and introduces the distinction between reversible and irreversible changes. Key teaching points:

- Materials have different properties that make them suitable for different uses
- Dissolving is a reversible change; the solute can be recovered by evaporating the solvent
- Mixtures can be separated by filtering, sieving, and evaporating
- Some changes are reversible (physical changes: melting, freezing, dissolving)
- Some changes are irreversible (chemical changes: burning, rusting, reactions like vinegar and bicarbonate of soda)
- New materials are formed in irreversible changes

### Earth and Space

**Statutory Content:**

**Key Concepts and Teaching Approaches:**

The Earth and space topic introduces concepts that challenge pupils' everyday experiences. Key teaching points:

- The Sun is at the centre of our solar system; planets orbit the Sun
- The Earth orbits the Sun once per year (365.25 days)
- The Moon orbits the Earth approximately once per month
- The Earth, Moon and Sun are approximately spherical (though not perfect spheres)
- Day and night are caused by the Earth rotating on its axis
- The apparent movement of the Sun across the sky is caused by Earth's rotation

**Note:** This is a topic where pupils' intuitive ideas often conflict with scientific understanding. Teachers should address common misconceptions explicitly, such as the idea that the Sun moves around the Earth.

Pupils might study the work of scientists such as Ptolemy, Alhazen and Copernicus.

### Forces

**Statutory Content:**
- Explain that unsupported objects fall towards the Earth because of the force of gravity acting between the Earth and the falling object
- Identify the effects of air resistance, water resistance and friction, that act between moving surfaces
- Recognise that some mechanisms, including levers, pulleys and gears, allow a smaller force to have a greater effect

**Key Concepts and Teaching Approaches:**

This topic introduces the concept of gravity as a force that pulls objects towards the Earth. Key teaching points:

- Gravity is a force that pulls objects towards the centre of the Earth
- Unsupported objects fall due to gravity
- Air resistance, water resistance and friction are forces that oppose motion
- Mechanisms like levers, pulleys and gears can change the size or direction of forces
- These mechanisms allow a smaller force to have a greater effect (force multipliers)

**Note:** Pupils might explore the work of scientists such as Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton.

## Year 6 Programme of Study

### Living Things and Their Habitats

**Statutory Content:**
- Describe how living things are classified into broad groups according to common observable characteristics and based on similarities and differences, including micro-organisms, plants and animals

### Evolution and Inheritance

**Statutory Content:**
- Recognise that living things have changed over time and that fossils provide information about living things that inhabited the Earth millions of years ago
- Recognise that living things produce offspring of the same kind, but normally offspring vary and are not identical to their parents
- Identify how animals and plants are adapted to suit their environment in different ways and that adaptation may lead to evolution

**Key Concepts and Teaching Approaches:**

This is a challenging topic that introduces fundamental concepts about how life changes over time. Key teaching points:

- Living things have changed over millions of years (evolution)
- Fossils provide evidence of life from long ago
- Offspring are similar to but not identical to their parents (variation)
- Living things are adapted to their environments
- Adaptations that help survival are more likely to be passed on
- Over long periods, adaptations can lead to new species

**Note:** This topic may raise questions about personal or religious beliefs. Teachers should be sensitive to different viewpoints while teaching the scientific understanding.

Pupils might study the work of Charles Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, Mary Anning, or David Attenborough.

### Light

**Statutory Content:**
- Recognise that light appears to travel in straight lines
- Use the idea that light travels in straight lines to explain that objects are seen because they give out or reflect light into the eye
- Explain that we see things because light travels from light sources to our eyes or from light sources to objects and then to our eyes
- Use the idea that light travels in straight lines to explain why shadows have the same shape as the objects that cast them

**Key Concepts and Teaching Approaches:**

The Year 6 light topic builds on Year 3 learning and introduces the concept that light travels in straight lines. Key teaching points:

- Light travels in straight lines from light sources
- We see objects when light enters our eyes
- Light may come directly from a light source or be reflected from objects

**Key Concepts and Teaching Approaches:**

This topic builds on Year 4 electricity learning and introduces voltage and circuit symbols. Key teaching points:

- Adding more cells (batteries) increases the voltage and makes bulbs brighter
- The voltage of cells affects how components work
- Circuit diagrams use standard symbols to represent components
- Standard symbols include: cell, battery, bulb, switch, buzzer, motor, wire
- Variations in circuits (number of bulbs, batteries) affect how components function

## Common Misconceptions in KS2 Science

### Biology Misconceptions

**Plants**
- **Misconception:** Plants get their food from the soil
  - **Correction:** Plants make their own food using sunlight, water and air (photosynthesis). The soil provides water and minerals, not food.

- **Misconception:** Plants breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide like animals
  - **Correction:** Plants respire (use oxygen, produce CO2) all the time, but during photosynthesis they take in CO2 and release oxygen.

**Animals and Humans**
- **Misconception:** Blood is blue inside the body and turns red when exposed to air
  - **Correction:** Blood is always red. Deoxygenated blood is darker red; oxygenated blood is brighter red.

- **Misconception:** The heart creates blood
  - **Correction:** The heart pumps blood but does not make it. Blood is made in bone marrow.

**Living Things and Habitats**
- **Misconception:** All insects are pests or dangerous
  - **Correction:** Insects play crucial roles in ecosystems as pollinators, decomposers, and food for other animals.

- **Misconception:** Plants are not living things because they don't move
  - **Correction:** Plants show all characteristics of living things: they grow, respond to stimuli, reproduce, and need nutrition.

### Chemistry Misconceptions

**States of Matter**
- **Misconception:** When water evaporates, it disappears or ceases to exist
  - **Correction:** Water changes into water vapour (a gas), which is still water but in a different state.

- **Misconception:** Steam is visible water vapour
  - **Correction:** Water vapour is invisible. What we see as "steam" is actually tiny droplets of liquid water that have condensed in cooler air.

**Materials**
- **Misconception:** Dissolving is the same as melting
  - **Correction:** Melting is a change of state (solid to liquid). Dissolving is when a substance mixes with a liquid to form a solution.

- **Misconception:** When something dissolves, it has disappeared
  - **Correction:** The substance is still present but is mixed evenly with the liquid. It can be recovered by evaporating the liquid.

- **Misconception:** Chemical changes are reversible if you try hard enough
  - **Correction:** Chemical changes (burning, rusting) form new substances and are not reversible.

### Physics Misconceptions

**Light**
- **Misconception:** Light is only needed for us to see; objects don't need light to exist
  - **Correction:** Light enables us to see objects. Without light, we cannot see objects, but they still exist.

- **Misconception:** Shadows are reflections
  - **Correction:** Shadows form when light is blocked. Reflections occur when light bounces off surfaces.

- **Misconception:** The Sun moves around the Earth
  - **Correction:** The Earth orbits the Sun. The apparent movement of the Sun across the sky is due to Earth's rotation.

**Electricity**
- **Misconception:** Electricity flows from both the positive and negative terminals of a battery and meets in the bulb
  - **Correction:** Current flows in one direction around a circuit (from negative to positive in conventional terms).

- **Misconception:** The electricity gets used up by components in a circuit
  - **Correction:** Current is the same at all points in a simple series circuit. Energy is transferred, not used up.

**Forces**
- **Misconception:** Gravity only exists on Earth
  - **Correction:** Gravity exists between all objects with mass. Earth's gravity is strongest because Earth is the most massive nearby object.

- **Misconception:** Heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects
  - **Correction:** In the absence of air resistance, all objects fall at the same rate. Air resistance affects light objects more.

## Assessment and Progression

### Assessment at Key Stage 2

Science is a statutory subject at Key Stage 2, but there are no statutory assessment requirements. However, schools are required to report to parents on pupils' progress and attainment. Effective assessment at KS2 should:

- Be integrated with teaching and learning
- Focus on both substantive knowledge and working scientifically skills
- Use a range of assessment approaches (observation, questioning, written work, practical tasks)
- Identify misconceptions and inform teaching
- Support pupils in understanding their own learning

### Transition to Key Stage 3

The KS2 science curriculum is designed to provide foundations for Key Stage 3. Areas of continuity include:

- Cells and organisation (building on knowledge of body systems)
- Particles and their properties (building on states of matter)
- Forces and motion (building on forces concepts)
- Chemical reactions (building on changes of materials)
- Interactions and interdependencies (building on habitats and ecosystems)
- Genetics and evolution (building on evolution and inheritance)

Effective transition requires that KS2 teachers ensure pupils have secure foundations in both scientific knowledge and working scientifically skills, preparing them for the more abstract and quantitative demands of secondary science.

## Resources and Support

### Primary Science Teaching Resources

- **ASE (Association for Science Education)** provides primary science resources, professional development, and the Primary Science journal
- **STEM Learning** offers free resources, lesson plans, and CPD for primary science
- **Explorify** provides free activities to develop working scientifically and science talk
- **Reach Out CPD** offers free online professional development for primary science

### Professional Development

The National STEM Learning Centre offers face-to-face and online professional development for primary science teachers. Key programmes include:
- Primary Science Subject Leaders' Development
- Working Scientifically in the Primary Classroom
- Assessment in Primary Science

## Conclusion

The Key Stage 2 science curriculum provides a comprehensive foundation in biology, chemistry, and physics while developing pupils' capacity to work scientifically. The structure of Lower and Upper KS2 reflects the developing cognitive abilities of pupils, with increasing sophistication in both content knowledge and scientific skills.

Effective teaching at KS2 priorities hands-on practical experience, addresses common misconceptions explicitly, and makes connections between different areas of science and between science and pupils' everyday experiences. By the end of KS2, pupils should have developed a secure foundation of scientific knowledge and understanding, preparing them for the more specialised study of science at Key Stage 3 and beyond.

The curriculum also emphasises the human dimension of science—pupils learn about the work of scientists and how scientific ideas develop and change over time. This historical and cultural context helps pupils understand science as a dynamic, evolving field of human endeavour rather than a fixed body of facts.
