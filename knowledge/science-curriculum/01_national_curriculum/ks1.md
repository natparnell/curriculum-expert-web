# Key Stage 1 Science: Statutory Requirements

## Introduction

The Key Stage 1 (KS1) science programme of study applies to Years 1 and 2 in maintained schools in England. This foundational stage builds upon the early scientific learning in the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), where children develop their understanding of the world through exploration and play. At Key Stage 1, science becomes a more structured subject, introducing pupils to the methods of scientific inquiry while maintaining the hands-on, exploratory approach that characterises effective primary science education.

The National Curriculum for science aims to ensure that all pupils develop scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding through the specific disciplines of biology, chemistry, and physics. At Key Stage 1, the focus is on developing pupils' curiosity about the natural world, their ability to ask questions, and their skills in observing, classifying, and conducting simple investigations.

The KS1 programme of study is organised around the three core sciences—Biology, Chemistry, and Physics—with content specified for Year 1 and Year 2. Working scientifically skills are integrated throughout, ensuring that pupils learn to work as scientists, not merely to acquire scientific facts.

This document provides a comprehensive account of the statutory requirements for Key Stage 1 science, drawing upon the official National Curriculum documentation, guidance from the Department for Education, and insights from science education research.

## Aims of the National Curriculum for Science at KS1

The National Curriculum for science aims to ensure that by the end of Key Stage 1, all pupils:

1. **Develop scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding** through the specific disciplines of biology, chemistry, and physics. Pupils learn about plants, animals, materials, and physical phenomena.

2. **Develop understanding of the nature, processes and methods of science** through different types of science enquiries. Pupils learn to ask questions, make observations, conduct simple tests, and gather and record data.

3. **Are equipped with the scientific knowledge required to understand the uses and implications of science** today and for the future. While this is more fully developed at later key stages, KS1 pupils begin to understand how science applies to their everyday lives.

At Key Stage 1, these aims translate into a curriculum that emphasises:
- **Curiosity and questioning**: Encouraging pupils to ask questions about the world around them
- **Hands-on experience**: Providing opportunities for direct exploration and investigation
- **Systematic observation**: Developing skills in careful, purposeful observation
- **Recording and communication**: Learning to record findings and communicate them to others
- **Making connections**: Understanding how science relates to everyday life

## Working Scientifically at Key Stage 1

### The Role of Working Scientifically

During years 1 and 2, pupils should be taught to use the following practical scientific methods, processes and skills through the teaching of the programme of study content:

- **Asking simple questions and recognising that they can be answered in different ways**: Pupils learn that science begins with questions and that there are different ways to investigate them.

- **Observing closely, using simple equipment**: Developing skills in careful observation, using tools such as magnifying glasses, rulers, and thermometers appropriately.

- **Performing simple tests**: Planning and conducting straightforward investigations to answer questions.

- **Identifying and classifying**: Grouping things according to their characteristics and recognising patterns.

- **Using their observations and ideas to suggest answers to questions**: Making sense of evidence and drawing simple conclusions.

- **Gathering and recording data to help in answering questions**: Learning to record findings in various ways, including drawings, charts, and simple tables.

These working scientifically skills are not taught separately but are integrated into the teaching of biology, chemistry, and physics content. Every topic provides opportunities for pupils to work as scientists.

### Progression in Working Scientifically

Working scientifically skills develop across Key Stage 1:

**Year 1**: Simple observations, asking questions, identifying and classifying based on obvious features, performing simple tests with teacher support.

**Year 2**: More systematic observation, measuring using standard units, making comparisons, recording data in simple tables, beginning to identify patterns in results.

## Year 1 Programme of Study

### Biology - Plants

Pupils should be taught to:
- Identify and name a variety of common wild and garden plants, including deciduous and evergreen trees
- Identify and describe the basic structure of a variety of common flowering plants, including trees

Pupils learn to recognise common plants in their local environment and to describe their basic parts (roots, stem/trunk, leaves, flowers). They observe how plants change through the seasons.

### Biology - Animals, including humans

Pupils should be taught to:
- Identify and name a variety of common animals including fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals

Pupils explore the materials that objects are made from and learn to describe their properties (e.g., hard, soft, rough, smooth, transparent, opaque).

### Physics - Seasonal changes

Pupils should be taught to:
- Observe changes across the four seasons
- Observe and describe weather associated with the seasons and how day length varies

Pupils observe and record changes in the natural world throughout the year, including weather patterns and variations in daylight.

## Year 2 Programme of Study

### Biology - Living things and their habitats

Pupils should be taught to:
- Explore and compare the differences between things that are living, dead, and things that have never been alive
- Identify that most living things live in habitats to which they are suited and describe how different habitats provide for the basic needs of different kinds of animals and plants, and how they depend on each other
- Identify and name a variety of plants and animals in their habitats, including micro-habitats
- Describe how animals obtain their food from plants and other animals, using the idea of a simple food chain, and identify and name different sources of food

Pupils explore the concept of living things, study different habitats, and learn about simple food chains.

### Biology - Plants

Pupils should be taught to:
- Observe and describe how seeds and bulbs grow into mature plants
- Find out and describe how plants need water, light and a suitable temperature to grow and stay healthy

Pupils conduct investigations into plant growth, exploring the requirements for healthy plant development.

### Biology - Animals, including humans

Pupils should be taught to:
- Notice that animals, including humans, have offspring which grow into adults
- Find out about and describe the basic needs of animals, including humans, for survival (water, food and air)
- Describe the importance for humans of exercise, eating the right amounts of different types of food, and hygiene

Pupils explore life cycles, basic needs for survival, and the foundations of human health.

### Chemistry - Uses of everyday materials

Pupils should be taught to:
- Identify and compare the suitability of a variety of everyday materials, including wood, metal, plastic, glass, brick, rock, paper and cardboard for particular uses
- Find out how the shapes of solid objects made from some materials can be changed by squashing, bending, twisting and stretching

Pupils explore how materials are chosen for specific purposes based on their properties, and investigate how materials can be changed.

## Key Concepts in KS1 Science

### Living Things and Life Processes

Throughout KS1, pupils develop understanding of:

**What it means to be alive**: The characteristics of living things (movement, growth, reproduction, sensitivity, nutrition, excretion, respiration—though not all are taught formally at KS1).

**Life cycles**: Understanding that living things grow and change, and that offspring grow into adults.

**Basic needs**: Recognising that living things need water, food, and air to survive.

**Habitats**: Understanding that living things live in places suited to their needs.

### Materials and Their Properties

Pupils develop understanding of:

**Identifying materials**: Recognising common materials and their sources.

**Properties of materials**: Describing materials using simple properties (hard/soft, rough/smooth, transparent/opaque, flexible/rigid).

**Uses of materials**: Understanding that materials are chosen for specific purposes based on their properties.

**Changing materials**: Recognising that materials can be changed physically (bent, stretched, twisted, squashed) without changing their material identity.

### Physical Processes

While KS1 physics is limited, pupils encounter:

**Seasonal changes**: Understanding patterns in the seasons, weather, and daylight.

**The human body**: Basic parts and their functions, including the senses.

### Scientific Enquiry

Pupils develop skills in:

**Observation**: Looking carefully, using all appropriate senses, using simple equipment.

**Classification**: Grouping things based on observable characteristics.

**Investigation**: Asking questions, planning simple tests, carrying out fair tests (with support), recording results.

**Communication**: Recording findings through drawings, simple tables, and spoken explanations.

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Hands-On Exploration

Effective KS1 science is characterised by hands-on exploration:

- **Direct experience**: Pupils encounter phenomena directly, not only through books or videos
- **Real objects**: Working with real plants, animals, and materials
- **The natural world**: Using the school grounds and local environment as a resource
- **Playful investigation**: Maintaining the exploratory approach from EYFS while adding structure

### Questioning

Developing pupils' questioning is central:

- **Encouraging curiosity**: Valuing pupils' questions and using them as starting points
- **Different types of questions**: Helping pupils understand that some questions can be answered through investigation, while others require research
- **Teacher modelling**: Demonstrating how to ask scientific questions

### Recording and Communicating

Pupils develop ways to record and share their findings:

- **Drawings and diagrams**: Representing observations visually
- **Simple tables**: Recording data systematically
- **Charts and graphs**: Simple pictorial representations (block graphs in Year 2)
- **Spoken explanations**: Describing what was done and what was found

### Making Links

Effective teaching makes links between science and pupils' lives:

- **Everyday contexts**: Connecting science to familiar experiences (food, weather, health)
- **Current events**: Using news stories and events as contexts for science
- **Cross-curricular links**: Connecting science to literacy, mathematics, and other subjects

## Assessment at Key Stage 1

### Teacher Assessment

At the end of Key Stage 1, teachers assess pupils against teacher assessment frameworks for science. These frameworks describe performance at the "expected standard". For 2023-24 onwards, these are used for internal assessment only.

The interim teacher assessment frameworks (for reference) indicate that pupils working at the expected standard should:

- Show knowledge and understanding of biology, chemistry, and physics content
- Use scientific methods, processes and skills appropriately
- Work scientifically to answer questions

### Ongoing Assessment

Effective assessment in KS1 science is ongoing and informs teaching:

- **Observation**: Watching pupils as they work scientifically
- **Questioning**: Using questions to probe understanding
- **Recording**: Reviewing pupils' written and drawn records
- **Discussion**: Listening to pupils explain their thinking

Assessment focuses on both scientific knowledge and working scientifically skills.

## Common Challenges

### Managing Practical Work

Practical science with young children presents challenges:

- **Organisation**: Managing equipment and ensuring all pupils are engaged
- **Safety**: Maintaining safety while allowing hands-on exploration
- **Time**: Practical work takes time; balancing depth with coverage

Strategies include thorough preparation, clear routines, and careful organisation of equipment.

### Developing Scientific Vocabulary

Science introduces new vocabulary that pupils need to master:

- **Naming plants and animals**: Learning correct names for common species
- **Material names**: Distinguishing between objects and materials
- **Process words**: Terms such as observe, compare, classify, investigate

Strategies include explicit vocabulary teaching, word banks, and repeated use in context.

### Differentiation

Pupils enter KS1 with varying experiences and abilities:

- **Support**: Providing scaffolds for those who need them (sentence stems, observation frames)
- **Extension**: Offering additional challenges for those ready for them (more complex investigations, wider research)
- **Inclusive practice**: Ensuring all pupils can access practical work and contribute meaningfully

### Transition from EYFS

Building on EYFS understanding the world provision:

- **Recognising prior learning**: Valuing what pupils have learned in reception
- **Adding structure**: Introducing more systematic approaches while maintaining exploration
- **Developing recording**: Building from EYFS observation and recording towards more systematic documentation

## Transition to Key Stage 2

### Foundations for KS2

By the end of Key Stage 1, pupils should have:

- Experience of working scientifically through practical investigation
- Knowledge of common plants, animals, and materials
- Understanding of basic needs for life and simple life cycles
- Skills in observation, classification, and simple recording
- Curiosity about the natural world and confidence in asking questions

These foundations enable pupils to access the more demanding KS2 curriculum, where they will encounter more abstract concepts, more complex investigations, and greater emphasis on fair testing and drawing conclusions.

### Addressing Gaps

Pupils who have not fully achieved the expected standard may need:

- Additional practical experiences
- Consolidation of vocabulary
- Support with recording and communicating findings
- Continued focus on working scientifically skills

## Resources and Support

### Practical Resources

Effective KS1 science requires practical resources:

- **Living things**: Plants for growing, resources for observing minibeasts
- **Materials**: Collections of everyday materials for sorting and investigation
- **Equipment**: Magnifying glasses, thermometers, timers, rulers, simple balances
- **Recording materials**: Paper, pencils, clipboards, cameras

### Outdoor Learning

The school grounds are a valuable resource:

- **Habitats**: Minibeast hunts, pond dipping, observing plants
- **Seasonal changes**: Weather stations, observing changes through the year
- **Growing areas**: Planting and growing seeds and bulbs

### Support Organisations

Several organisations support primary science:

- **The Association for Science Education (ASE)**: Professional association providing resources and CPD
- **STEM Learning**: Resources, CPD, and the STEM Ambassadors programme
- **The Primary Science Teaching Trust (PSTT)**: Supporting excellence in primary science
- **Science museums and centres**: Many offer programmes for primary schools

## Conclusion

Key Stage 1 science provides the foundation for pupils' scientific education. Through hands-on exploration, systematic observation, and guided investigation, pupils develop both scientific knowledge and the skills of working scientifically. The statutory programme of study ensures that all pupils encounter biology, chemistry, and physics content while maintaining the curiosity and exploratory approach that characterises effective early science education.

Teachers who provide rich practical experiences, encourage questioning, and help pupils make connections between science and their everyday lives give their pupils the best possible start in science. The foundations laid in Years 1 and 2—secure knowledge of plants, animals, and materials, and confidence in working scientifically—enable pupils to thrive in the more demanding science curriculum of Key Stage 2 and beyond.

As pupils progress to Year 3, they carry with them not only knowledge of scientific content but also the disposition of scientists: curiosity about the world, confidence in asking questions, and skills in seeking answers through investigation. These attributes, developed in the early years of primary education, are as important as any specific scientific knowledge in preparing pupils for a world where scientific literacy is increasingly essential.
