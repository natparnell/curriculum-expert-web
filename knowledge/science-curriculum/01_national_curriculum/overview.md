# National Curriculum for Science: Statutory Overview

_Last updated: February 2026_

## Introduction and Legal Basis

The National Curriculum for Science in England is established under the **Education Act 2002** and the **Education Reform Act 1988**, with the current statutory programmes of study coming into force in September 2014 for key stages 1–3, and September 2016 for key stage 4 (with full implementation for Year 11 pupils from September 2017). All maintained schools in England are legally required to follow the National Curriculum programmes of study for science.

The science curriculum is unique within the National Curriculum framework in that it represents a **core statutory subject** from the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) through to the end of key stage 4. Unlike many foundation subjects, science retains its statutory status at all key stages, reflecting its recognised importance for both individual pupil development and national economic prosperity.

The statutory documentation is published by the Department for Education (DfE) and comprises:
- The **National Curriculum in England: Science Programmes of Study** (May 2015)
- The **Statutory Framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage** (incorporating Understanding the World: The Natural World)
- Associated **Ofqual subject criteria** for GCSE and A Level qualifications

---

## Purpose of Study

The National Curriculum states that **"a high-quality science education provides the foundations for understanding the world through the specific disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics."** Science has changed our lives and is vital to the world's future prosperity. All pupils should be taught essential aspects of the knowledge, methods, processes and uses of science.

The curriculum emphasises building up a **body of key foundational knowledge and concepts**, encouraging pupils to recognise the power of rational explanation and develop a sense of excitement and curiosity about natural phenomena. Pupils should understand how science can be used to explain what is occurring, predict how things will behave, and analyse causes.

---

## National Curriculum Aims

The National Curriculum for science aims to ensure that **all pupils**:

1. **Develop scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding** through the specific disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics
2. **Develop understanding of the nature, processes and methods of science** through different types of science enquiries that help them to answer scientific questions about the world around them
3. **Are equipped with the scientific knowledge required to understand the uses and implications of science**, today and for the future

These three aims represent the **tripartite structure** of science education: substantive knowledge (what scientists know), disciplinary knowledge (how scientists work), and transformative knowledge (the impact of science on society).

---

## Scientific Knowledge and Conceptual Understanding

### Knowledge as the Foundation

The programmes of study describe a **sequence of knowledge and concepts** that pupils should acquire. The curriculum documentation explicitly warns that "while it is important that pupils make progress, it is also vitally important that they develop secure understanding of each key block of knowledge and concepts in order to progress to the next stage."

Insecure, superficial understanding creates serious problems:
- Pupils may struggle at key points of transition (particularly between primary and secondary school)
- Serious misconceptions can build up and become entrenched
- Significant difficulties may arise when encountering higher-order content

### The Role of Language and Vocabulary

Pupils should be able to describe associated processes and key characteristics in **common language**, but they should also be familiar with, and use, **technical terminology accurately and precisely**. The curriculum requires that pupils build up an extended specialist vocabulary across all key stages.

The **spoken language** requirements within the science curriculum reflect the importance of language in pupils' cognitive, social and linguistic development. Teachers should ensure that pupils build secure foundations by using discussion to probe and remedy misconceptions.

### Mathematical Application

Pupils should apply their **mathematical knowledge** to their understanding of science, including:
- Collecting data
- Presenting data
- Analysing data
- Drawing mathematical conclusions

This requirement strengthens as pupils progress through the key stages, with increasing emphasis on quantitative work at key stages 3 and 4.

## The Nature, Processes and Methods of Science

### Working Scientifically

**'Working scientifically'** specifies the understanding of the nature, processes and methods of science for each year group. Critically, the National Curriculum states that it **"should not be taught as a separate strand."** Instead, working scientifically must always be taught **through and clearly related to** the teaching of substantive science content.

The curriculum identifies **five types of scientific enquiry** that pupils should encounter:

1. **Observing over time** — identifying and measuring events and changes that occur over periods from seconds to months
2. **Pattern seeking** — observing and recording natural phenomena, identifying patterns, and making predictions
3. **Identifying, classifying and grouping** — sorting objects, living things and events into groups using various criteria
4. **Comparative and fair testing (controlled investigations)** — planning investigations to answer questions by controlling variables
5. **Researching using secondary sources** — finding information from books, databases, websites and other reference materials

### Progression in Working Scientifically

The curriculum specifies different expectations for working scientifically at different key stages:

- **Key Stages 1 and 2**: Focus on experiencing and observing phenomena, developing curiosity, asking questions, and beginning to use simple scientific language
- **Key Stage 3**: Working scientifically is developed further once pupils have built up sufficient understanding of science to engage meaningfully in more sophisticated discussion of experimental design and control
- **Key Stage 4**: Increased emphasis on investigative approaches, including the assessment of practical skills through required practicals

---

## School Curriculum Requirements

### Flexibility Within Key Stages

The programmes of study for science are set out **year-by-year for key stages 1 and 2**. However, schools are only required to teach the relevant programme of study **by the end of the key stage**. Within each key stage, schools therefore have flexibility to:
- Introduce content earlier or later than set out in the programme of study
- Introduce key stage content during an earlier key stage if appropriate

### Year-by-Year Curriculum Documentation

All schools are required to **set out their school curriculum for science on a year-by-year basis** and make this information available online. This requirement ensures transparency for parents and supports curriculum continuity when pupils transfer between schools.

### Non-Statutory Guidance

Schools are **not required by law** to teach the content indicated as being 'non-statutory' within the programmes of study. The notes and guidance sections provide:
- Examples of how working scientifically might be embedded within content
- Contextual information about progression
- Suggested teaching approaches

---

## Attainment Targets

By the end of each key stage, pupils are expected to **know, apply and understand** the matters, skills and processes specified in the relevant programme of study.

The National Curriculum does not prescribe specific assessment criteria or levels. Instead, schools are responsible for developing their own assessment systems that:
- Track progress against the programmes of study
- Identify gaps in knowledge and understanding
- Inform teaching and curriculum planning

---

## Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS)

### Understanding the World: The Natural World

While not formally part of the National Curriculum, science in the Early Years Foundation Stage is encompassed within the **Understanding the World** area of learning, specifically the **Natural World** educational programme.

The **Statutory Framework for the EYFS** (September 2021) and **Development Matters** (July 2021) provide guidance on science-relevant learning in the early years.

### Early Learning Goals

The level of development that children should be expected to have attained by the end of the EYFS is defined by the **early learning goals (ELGs)**. The relevant ELG is **Understanding the World: The Natural World**, which requires that children:

- Explore the natural world around them, making observations and drawing pictures of animals and plants
- Know some similarities and differences between the natural world around them and contrasting environments, drawing on their experiences and what has been read in class
- Understand some important processes and changes in the natural world around them, including the seasons and changing states of matter

### Development Matters Guidance

The non-statutory **Development Matters** guidance (July 2021) emphasises:
- **Curiosity and exploration** — children should develop positive attitudes and interests in the world around them
- **Observation and description** — children should notice and describe what they see
- **Pattern recognition** — children should begin to notice patterns and changes
- **Vocabulary development** — enriching and widening children's vocabulary to support later reading comprehension

Research from the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) and Ofsted's science research review (2021) emphasise that **early vocabulary development** in science is critical for later success. Pupils who enter key stage 1 with rich language to describe the natural world are better positioned to develop scientific understanding.

---

## Key Stage 1 (Years 1–2)

### Principal Focus

The principal focus of science teaching in key stage 1 is to enable pupils to **experience and observe phenomena**, looking more closely at the natural and humanly constructed world around them. They should be encouraged to be curious and ask questions about what they notice.

### Pedagogical Approaches

Pupils should be helped to develop their understanding of scientific ideas by using **different types of scientific enquiry** to answer their own questions, including:
- Observing changes over a period of time
- Noticing patterns
- Grouping and classifying things
- Carrying out simple comparative tests
- Finding things out using secondary sources of information

### Practical Experience

**Most of the learning about science should be done through the use of first-hand practical experiences**, but there should also be some use of appropriate secondary sources, such as books, photographs and videos.

Pupils should begin to use **simple scientific language** to talk about what they have found out and communicate their ideas to a range of audiences in a variety of ways.

### Statutory Content Areas

The key stage 1 programme of study includes:

- **Working scientifically** — asking simple questions, observing closely, performing simple tests, identifying and classifying, gathering and recording data
- **Plants** — structure, growth, basic needs
- **Animals, including humans** — basic structure, needs for survival, healthy living
- **Everyday materials** — properties, uses, changes
- **Seasonal changes** — observing changes across the four seasons

---

## Key Stage 2 (Years 3–6)

### Lower Key Stage 2 (Years 3–4)

The principal focus is to enable pupils to **broaden their scientific view of the world around them**. They should do this through:
- Exploring, talking about, testing and developing ideas
- Asking their own questions about what happens, why things happen, and how things work
- Making decisions about which types of scientific enquiry are likely to be the best ways of answering them
- Drawing simple conclusions and using scientific language to explain findings

### Upper Key Stage 2 (Years 5–6)

The principal focus is to enable pupils to develop a **deeper understanding of a wide range of scientific ideas**. They should do this through:
- Exploring and talking about their ideas
- Asking their own questions about scientific phenomena
- Analysing functions, relationships and interactions more systematically
- Encountering more abstract ideas and beginning to recognise how these ideas help them to understand and predict how the world operates

### Working Scientifically at KS2

Pupils should be taught to use the following practical scientific methods, processes and skills:
- Planning different types of scientific enquiries
- Taking measurements with increasing accuracy and precision
- Recording data and results using scientific diagrams and labels, classification keys, tables, scatter graphs, bar and line graphs
- Reporting and presenting findings from enquiries
- Identifying scientific evidence that has been used to support or refute ideas or arguments

### Statutory Content Areas

The key stage 2 programme of study includes:

**Year 3:**
- Plants — functions of parts, life cycles, requirements for life
- Animals, including humans — nutrition, skeletons and muscles
- Rocks — formation, properties, fossils
- Light — reflection, shadows
- Forces and magnets — attraction and repulsion, magnetic materials

**Year 4:**
- Living things and their habitats — classification, environmental change
- Animals, including humans — digestive system, food chains, teeth
- States of matter — solids, liquids, gases, changes of state
- Sound — vibrations, pitch, volume
- Electricity — simple circuits, conductors and insulators

**Year 5:**
- Living things and their habitats — life cycles, reproduction
- Animals, including humans — human development from birth to old age
- Properties and changes of materials — hardness, solubility, transparency, conductivity, reversible and irreversible changes
- Earth and space — solar system, day and night, seasons
- Forces — gravity, air resistance, water resistance, friction, mechanisms

**Year 6:**
- Living things and their habitats — classification, characteristics, adaptation
- Animals, including humans — circulatory system, diet, exercise, drugs
- Evolution and inheritance — adaptation, inheritance, fossil evidence
- Light — how we see, light travelling in straight lines, shadows
- Electricity — voltage, components, circuit diagrams

---

## Key Stage 3 (Years 7–9)

### Principal Focus

The principal focus of science teaching in key stage 3 is to develop a **deeper understanding of a range of ideas** in the subject disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics. Pupils should begin to see the connections between these subject areas and become aware of some of the big ideas underpinning scientific knowledge and understanding.

### The Three Disciplines

The key stage 3 programme of study is organised into the three traditional scientific disciplines:

#### Biology
- Structure and function of living organisms
- Material cycles and energy
- Interactions and interdependencies
- Genetics and evolution

#### Chemistry
- The particulate nature of matter
- Atoms, elements and compounds
- Pure and impure substances
- Chemical reactions
- Energetics
- The Periodic Table
- Materials
- Earth and atmosphere

#### Physics
- Energy
- Motion and forces
- Waves
- Electricity and electromagnetism
- Matter
- Space physics

### Working Scientifically at KS3

Working scientifically at key stage 3 includes:
- **Scientific attitudes** — understanding the nature of scientific enquiry, the role of evidence, the importance of reproducibility
- **Experimental skills and investigations** — planning, carrying out, and evaluating investigations
- **Analysis and evaluation** — presenting data, drawing conclusions, identifying patterns
- **Measurement** — understanding uncertainty, accuracy, precision

The curriculum notes that working scientifically at key stage 3 builds on the foundations established at key stages 1 and 2, but now pupils have sufficient understanding to engage in **more sophisticated discussion of experimental design and control**.

---

## Key Stage 4 (Years 10–11)

### GCSE Qualifications

Key stage 4 science leads to **GCSE qualifications**. Pupils must be taught either:

1. **GCSE Combined Science** — worth two GCSEs, covering biology, chemistry and physics in less depth than separate sciences
2. **GCSE Separate Sciences** (also known as Triple Science) — three separate GCSEs in biology, chemistry and physics, studied in greater depth

### GCSE Combined Science

Combined Science (also called Combined Science: Trilogy or Synergy) covers content from all three sciences but with reduced content compared to separate sciences. It is worth **two GCSE grades** (awarded as a double grade, e.g., 5-5, 6-5).

The major examination boards offering Combined Science are:
- **AQA** — Combined Science: Trilogy
- **Edexcel** — Combined Science
- **OCR** — Gateway Combined Science
- **Eduqas** — Combined Science

### GCSE Separate Sciences (Triple Science)

Separate sciences offer **three distinct GCSE qualifications**:
- GCSE Biology
- GCSE Chemistry
- GCSE Physics

This pathway is typically chosen by pupils who:
- Have a strong interest in science
- Are considering A Level sciences
- Are interested in science-related careers

### Ofqual Subject Criteria

All GCSE science specifications must comply with **Ofqual subject criteria**, which prescribe:
- Content requirements (biology, chemistry, physics)
- Assessment objectives (AO1: knowledge and understanding; AO2: application; AO3: practical skills and analysis)
- Minimum practical requirements (required practicals)

### Required Practicals

All GCSE science courses include **required practical activities** that pupils must complete. These are:
- Assessed through written examinations (at least 15% of marks are for practical skills)
- Listed explicitly in each specification
- Designed to develop practical skills and understanding

For Combined Science, there are **21 required practicals** (7 in each science). For separate sciences, there are **8 required practicals per science** (24 total).

---

## Key Stage 5 (Years 12–13)

### A Level Qualifications

Post-16 science education leads to **GCE A Level qualifications** in:
- A Level Biology
- A Level Chemistry
- A Level Physics

These qualifications are offered by the same awarding organisations (AQA, Edexcel, OCR, Eduqas) and must comply with **Ofqual GCE subject criteria**.

### Practical Endorsement

A distinctive feature of A Level sciences is the **practical endorsement**. This is:
- A **separate pass/unclassified grade** reported alongside the A Level grade
- Based on teacher observation and assessment of practical competence
- Assessed against **Common Practical Assessment Criteria (CPAC)**
- Requires pupils to complete at least **12 practical activities** per science

The practical endorsement grade does not count towards the A Level grade but is required or preferred by most universities for science-related courses.

### Assessment Structure

A Level science assessments include:
- **Written examinations** (typically 3 papers per subject)
- **Practical skills questions** embedded within written papers (at least 15% of marks)
- **Practical endorsement** (separate pass/unclassified)

Some specifications also include a **non-examined assessment (NEA)** component, though this is less common following reforms in 2015.

## Ofsted Research Review: Principles for High-Quality Science Education

In April 2021, Ofsted published its **Research Review Series: Science**, identifying key principles that contribute to high-quality science education. These principles align closely with the National Curriculum aims and provide guidance for curriculum implementation.

### Principle 1: Planning for Knowledge Progression

Ofsted (2021) emphasises that **"planning the science curriculum so that pupils build knowledge of key concepts and the relationships between them over many years"** prevents pupils from seeing science as a list of isolated facts. This requires:
- Identifying the **big ideas** that underpin scientific understanding
- Mapping how knowledge builds cumulatively across key stages
- Making explicit the **relationships between concepts**

### Principle 2: Prioritising Long-Term Memory

The review notes that **"pupils remembering long-term the content that has been taught"** is essential because building domain-specific knowledge leads to expertise. This has implications for:
- Curriculum design (spacing and interleaving)
- Assessment practices (checking retention, not just performance)
- Pedagogical choices (explicit teaching, retrieval practice)

### Principle 3: Explicit Teaching of Working Scientifically

Ofsted argues that pupils benefit from **explicitly teaching the concepts and procedures needed to work scientifically**, rather than assuming these skills develop naturally through practical activity.

### Principle 4: Starting in the Early Years

The review highlights the importance of **starting curriculum planning right from the early years** by introducing pupils to wide-ranging vocabulary to describe the natural world. These words should not be overly technical but should build a foundation for later learning.

### Principle 5: Clear Explanations

Teachers should give **clear explanations that build on what pupils already know** and explicitly focus pupils' attention on the content being learned. This requires:
- Assessing prior knowledge
- Addressing misconceptions directly
- Using modelling and worked examples

### Principle 6: Purposeful Practical Work

Ofsted stresses that **practical work should have a clear purpose**, form part of a wider teaching sequence, and take place only when pupils have enough prior knowledge to learn from the activity. This challenges approaches that treat practical work as inherently valuable regardless of context.

### Principle 7: Subject-Specific CPD

The review notes that **science teachers and technicians need access to regular, high-quality subject-specific continuous professional development**, especially given that many science teachers are teaching outside their subject specialism.

---

## Key Transitions and Progression

### EYFS to Key Stage 1

The transition from early years to formal schooling involves:
- Moving from exploratory play to more structured investigation
- Introducing scientific vocabulary systematically
- Developing the ability to record observations in various forms

Pupils who have experienced rich **Understanding the World** provision in the EYFS are better prepared for key stage 1 science.

### Key Stage 1 to Key Stage 2

Progression from KS1 to KS2 involves:
- Greater emphasis on planning investigations
- More sophisticated data recording and presentation
- Introduction to abstract concepts (e.g., electricity as a flow)
- Increased mathematical demand

### Key Stage 2 to Key Stage 3

This transition is widely recognised as challenging. The National Curriculum explicitly warns that pupils may struggle at this point if they have **insecure, superficial understanding** of KS2 content.

Key differences at KS3:
- Separate teaching of biology, chemistry and physics
- Increased mathematical demand
- More abstract concepts (atoms, energy, forces)
- Greater emphasis on scientific explanations using models

Effective transition requires:
- Primary-secondary liaison on curriculum coverage
- Assessment of prior knowledge on entry to Year 7
- Addressing gaps before introducing new content

### Key Stage 3 to Key Stage 4

The move to GCSE involves:
- More content in less time (KS4 is typically 2 years vs 3 years for KS3)
- Increased mathematical demand
- Required practicals with specific assessment objectives
- External examination pressure

### Key Stage 4 to Key Stage 5

A Level science represents a significant step up in demand:
- Greater mathematical sophistication
- More abstract and theoretical content
- Independent practical work (practical endorsement)
- Expectation of wider reading and deeper understanding

Universities report that many students struggle with the transition to degree-level science, often because of gaps in foundational knowledge from earlier key stages.

---

## Common Misconceptions

The National Curriculum and associated research identify common misconceptions that pupils hold at different stages:

### Early Years and Key Stage 1
- Living things vs non-living things (some children classify cars as alive because they move)
- Plants are not alive in the same way animals are
- All materials are either solid or liquid (difficulty with powder, gel, foam)

### Key Stage 2
- Electricity is a substance that flows out of batteries
- Heat is a substance that rises
- The Earth orbits the Sun in an egg-shaped (oval) path
- Plants get their food from the soil
- Evolution is about individual organisms changing to suit their environment

### Key Stage 3
- Particles expand when heated (rather than the space between them increasing)
- Forces are needed to keep objects moving
- Chemical bonds store energy
- Acids are dangerous and bases are safe
- Genes determine characteristics directly without environmental influence

### Key Stage 4
- Electric current is used up in a circuit
- Energy is a substance
- Chemical reactions involve atoms changing into other atoms
- Natural selection involves organisms wanting to adapt
- Nuclear radiation makes things radioactive

Addressing these misconceptions requires **explicit teaching** that challenges pupils' intuitive ideas, not just presenting correct information.

---

## Statutory Assessment

### EYFS

Science is not assessed separately in the EYFS. The **Early Learning Goals** for Understanding the World: The Natural World are assessed holistically through observation.

### Key Stage 1

There is **no statutory assessment** for science at KS1. Schools may use teacher assessment frameworks if they choose.

### Key Stage 2

Since 2014, there has been **no statutory teacher assessment** of science at KS2. However, since 2016, a **national sampling test** has been administered to a small number of schools each year to monitor standards.

### Key Stage 4

Science is assessed through **GCSE examinations**:
- Written papers (multiple, depending on specification)
- Practical skills assessed through written questions
- No coursework (following 2015 reforms)

### Key Stage 5

A Level science is assessed through:
- Written examinations
- Practical endorsement (separate pass/fail)

## Summary

The National Curriculum for Science in England provides a comprehensive framework for science education from the early years through to age 16. Its structure reflects several key principles:

1. **Science as a core subject** — statutory at all key stages
2. **Three aims** — substantive knowledge, disciplinary knowledge, and transformative knowledge
3. **Working scientifically** — embedded within content, not taught separately
4. **Progression** — careful sequencing of concepts to build understanding over time
5. **Flexibility** — schools determine how to organise content within key stages
6. **Transparency** — year-by-year curriculum must be published online

The curriculum is complemented by GCSE and A Level specifications at key stages 4 and 5, and by Ofsted's research review which provides guidance on high-quality implementation. The transition points between key stages represent critical moments where insecure understanding can create long-term difficulties, making careful curriculum planning and assessment essential.
