# Science in the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS)

_Last updated: February 2026_

## Introduction

Science in the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) is not taught as a discrete subject but is embedded within the **Understanding the World** area of learning, specifically the **Natural World** educational programme. The EYFS framework sets the standards for the learning, development and care of children from birth to five years old in England.

The Statutory Framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage (DfE, September 2021) requires all early years providers to follow this framework, which includes the **Early Learning Goals (ELGs)** that children should be expected to have attained by the end of Reception year.

## The EYFS Statutory Framework

### Legal Basis

The **Statutory Framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage** is established under the **Childcare Act 2006**. It became statutory in September 2021, replacing the 2017 framework. All early years providers in England, including maintained schools, non-maintained schools, independent schools, and all providers on the Early Years Register, must comply with this framework.

### Overarching Principles

The EYFS is built on four guiding principles:

1. **Every child is a unique child**, who is constantly learning and can be resilient, capable, confident and self-assured
2. **Children learn to be strong and independent through positive relationships**
3. **Children learn and develop well in enabling environments** with teaching and support from adults who respond to their individual interests and needs
4. **Children develop and learn at different rates**, and all areas of learning and development are equally important and interconnected

These principles underpin all early years science education, emphasising exploration, play, and following children's interests.

## Understanding the World

### The Three Educational Programmes

Understanding the World is one of the seven areas of learning and development in the EYFS. It comprises three educational programmes:

1. **Past and Present** — history and chronology
2. **People, Culture and Communities** — geography and social understanding
3. **The Natural World** — the science-focused programme

### The Natural World Educational Programme

The statutory educational programme for The Natural World states that children should be supported to:

- Explore the natural world around them, making observations and drawing pictures of animals and plants
- Know some similarities and differences between the natural world around them and contrasting environments, drawing on their experiences and what has been read in class
- Understand some important processes and changes in the natural world around them, including the seasons and changing states of matter

This programme provides the foundation for later science learning in key stage 1 and beyond.

## Early Learning Goals (ELGs)

### The Natural World ELG

By the end of Reception (the final year of the EYFS), children should have attained the following Early Learning Goal:

> **Understanding the World: The Natural World**
>
> - Explore the natural world around them, making observations and drawing pictures of animals and plants
> - Know some similarities and differences between the natural world around them and contrasting environments, drawing on their experiences and what has been read in class
> - Understand some important processes and changes in the natural world around them, including the seasons and changing states of matter

This ELG represents the **endpoint** of EYFS science learning. It is not a curriculum in itself but a goal to work towards through a rich, exploratory curriculum.

### Assessment of the ELG

Practitioners assess whether children have met the ELG based on:
- **Observation** of children's play and exploration
- **Discussion** with children about what they have noticed
- **Evidence** in the form of drawings, photographs, or adult annotations

The assessment is **holistic** — it considers the child's overall development and learning across the EYFS, not just isolated scientific knowledge.

## Development Matters (Non-Statutory Guidance)

### Purpose

**Development Matters** (DfE, July 2021) is non-statutory guidance that supports practitioners in implementing the statutory framework. It provides:
- A top-level view of child development
- Guidance on how children develop and learn
- Suggestions for how to support this development and learning

### Age Bands

Development Matters organises learning into age bands:
- **Birth to three** — three sub-bands: Birth to 3, 3-6 months, 6-12 months, 1-2 years, 2-3 years
- **3 and 4 year olds**
- **Children in Reception**

### Development Matters: The Natural World

The guidance outlines how children's understanding of the natural world typically develops:

#### Birth to Three
- Explore natural materials, providing open-ended play opportunities
- Use all their senses in hands-on exploration of natural materials
- Explore collections of materials with similar and/or different properties
- Talk about what they see, using a wide vocabulary

#### 3 and 4 Year Olds
- Explore how things work
- Plant seeds and care for growing plants
- Understand the key features of the life cycle of a plant and an animal
- Begin to understand the need to respect and care for the natural environment and all living things
- Explore and talk about different forces they can feel
- Talk about the differences between materials and changes they notice

#### Children in Reception
- Explore the natural world around them
- Describe what they see, hear and feel whilst outside
- Recognise some environments that are different from the one in which they live
- Understand the effect of changing seasons on the natural world around them

---

## Birth to 5 Matters (Alternative Guidance)

### Overview

**Birth to 5 Matters** (Early Education, 2021) is an alternative non-statutory guidance produced by the early years sector in response to the revised EYFS. It provides:
- More detailed guidance than Development Matters
- A research-informed approach
- Greater emphasis on child development and play-based learning

### Key Differences

Birth to 5 Matters differs from Development Matters in:
- **Longer age bands** — Birth-3, 3-5, 5-6
- **More detailed descriptors** for each aspect of learning
- **Greater emphasis on play** and child-initiated learning
- **Additional guidance** on inclusive practice and English as an additional language

Settings can choose to use Development Matters, Birth to 5 Matters, or their own equivalent document.

## Progression from EYFS to Key Stage 1

### The Transition

The transition from EYFS to Year 1 represents a significant shift in the approach to science education:

| Aspect | EYFS | Key Stage 1 |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Structure** | Integrated within Understanding the World | Separate subject with dedicated curriculum time |
| **Approach** | Play-based, child-initiated exploration | More structured, adult-directed learning |
| **Recording** | Observations, photographs, child-initiated mark-making | More formal recording, worksheets, written accounts |
| **Vocabulary** | Informal, everyday language | Introduction of scientific terminology |
| **Enquiry** | Exploratory play | More structured scientific enquiries |

### Preparing for KS1

Effective transition requires:
- **Building vocabulary** — children should enter Year 1 with rich language to describe the natural world
- **Developing observation skills** — the ability to look closely and notice details
- **Understanding of basic concepts** — living things grow, materials have properties, seasons change
- **Positive attitudes** — curiosity, enthusiasm, and confidence in exploring the world

Ofsted's science research review (2021) emphasises that **starting curriculum planning right from the early years** by introducing pupils to wide-ranging vocabulary is essential for later success.

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Play-Based Learning

Play is the **primary vehicle for learning** in the EYFS. Science learning emerges from:
- **Child-initiated play** — children exploring resources and environments that interest them
- **Adult-guided play** — practitioners introducing new concepts or extending thinking through sensitive intervention
- **Adult-led activities** — planned experiences to introduce specific concepts or skills

### The Role of the Adult

Practitioners support science learning through:

#### Interactions
- **Open-ended questions** — "What do you notice?" "I wonder why...?" "What might happen if...?"
- **Commentary** — describing what children are doing to extend vocabulary
- **Scaffolding** — providing just enough support to help children achieve the next step

#### Environment
- **Rich indoor and outdoor environments** with natural materials
- **Collections of resources** — shells, stones, seeds, magnets, magnifiers
- **Living things** — plants to care for, opportunities to observe wildlife
- **Access to the outdoors** in all weathers

#### Planning
- **Responsive planning** — building on children's interests and fascinations
- **Continuous provision** — resources always available for children to return to
- **Enhanced provision** — adding specific resources to follow interests or introduce concepts

### Outdoor Learning

The outdoor environment is essential for science in the EYFS. It provides:
- **Space for active exploration** and large-scale investigation
- **Contact with living things** — plants, insects, birds, weather
- **Natural materials** — soil, sand, water, stones, leaves
- **Seasonal changes** — observable through the year
- **Risk and challenge** — climbing, balancing, exploring uneven ground

---

## Key Concepts in EYFS Science

### Living Things

Children explore:
- **Plants** — growing from seeds, what they need to grow, parts of plants
- **Animals** — including humans, basic needs, life cycles, habitats
- **Humans** — themselves, their bodies, how they grow and change
- **Care for living things** — the importance of looking after plants and animals

### Materials

Children investigate:
- **Natural materials** — wood, stone, water, soil, sand
- **Man-made materials** — plastic, metal, fabric
- **Properties** — rough, smooth, hard, soft, transparent, opaque
- **Changes** — melting ice, mixing materials, dissolving

### Physical Processes

Children experience:
- **Forces** — pushing, pulling, floating, sinking
- **Magnetism** — exploring what magnets attract
- **Light** — shadows, reflections, transparent/coloured materials
- **Sound** — loud/quiet, different sounds, making sounds
- **Electricity** — simple circuits (toys, torches)

### The Natural World

Children learn about:
- **Seasons** — changes in weather, trees, daylight
- **Weather** — rain, sun, wind, snow, temperature
- **The environment** — local area, different environments (desert, polar, jungle)
- **Caring for the environment** — recycling, looking after living things

## Common Misconceptions in the Early Years

Understanding common misconceptions helps practitioners address them through play and discussion:

### Living Things
- **"If it moves, it's alive"** — children may classify cars, wind, and robots as alive because they move
- **Plants are not alive** — because they don't move or make sounds like animals
- **All small animals are insects** — confusion between spiders, worms, and insects

### Materials
- **Ice is not water** — difficulty understanding that ice and water are the same material in different states
- **Dissolving is the same as melting** — confusing processes
- **Heavy things always sink** — not understanding density

### The Natural World
- **The moon and sun are the same thing** — confusion between day and night objects
- **Clouds are made of cotton wool** — literal interpretations
- **Seasons are random** — not understanding the cycle or causes

Addressing these requires repeated experiences, discussion, and sensitive correction through play.

## Effective Practice

### Characteristics of Effective Teaching and Learning

The EYFS identifies three characteristics that underpin all learning, including science:

1. **Playing and Exploring** — finding out and exploring, playing with what they know, being willing to 'have a go'
2. **Active Learning** — being involved and concentrating, keeping trying, enjoying achieving what they set out to do
3. **Creating and Thinking Critically** — having their own ideas, making links, choosing ways to do things

Effective science provision supports all three characteristics.

### High-Quality Provision

High-quality early years science includes:
- **Time** — extended periods for deep exploration
- **Space** — indoor and outdoor environments that invite investigation
- **Resources** — open-ended, natural materials that can be used in multiple ways
- **Relationships** — responsive adults who extend thinking and model curiosity
- **Language** — rich vocabulary and opportunities for discussion

---

## Assessment and Observation

### Observation

Observation is the primary assessment tool in the EYFS. Practitioners:
- Observe children during child-initiated play
- Note what children do, say, and show interest in
- Take photographs and make video recordings
- Record children's exact words (where possible)

### The Leuven Scale

Some settings use the **Leuven Scale of Well-Being and Involvement** (Ferre Laevers) to assess:
- **Well-being** — feeling at ease, acting spontaneously, showing vitality
- **Involvement** — concentration, energy, complexity, creativity

High levels of well-being and involvement indicate effective learning, including in science.

### Documentation

Common approaches to documenting learning include:
- **Learning journals** — individual records for each child
- **Floor books** — collaborative records of class investigations
- **Display boards** — visual records with photographs and captions
- **Digital portfolios** — online systems for sharing with parents

## Links to the National Curriculum

### Preparing for Key Stage 1

The EYFS Natural World programme prepares children for key stage 1 science by developing:

- **Observation skills** — looking closely and noticing details
- **Vocabulary** — words to describe living things, materials, and changes
- **Enquiry skills** — asking questions, making predictions, testing ideas
- **Conceptual foundations** — basic understanding of living things, materials, and processes
- **Positive attitudes** — curiosity, enjoyment, and confidence in science

### Curriculum Continuity

The **PLAN (Primary Science Assessment)** resources, developed by the Association for Science Education (ASE), explicitly map how EYFS experiences prepare children for the Year 1 programme of study. Key transitions include:

- EYFS exploring plants → KS1 learning about plant structure and growth
- EYFS investigating materials → KS1 testing material properties
- EYFS observing animals → KS1 classifying animals and understanding basic needs
- EYFS experiencing seasons → KS1 understanding seasonal changes

## Summary

Science in the EYFS is not a discrete subject but an integral part of **Understanding the World: The Natural World**. It is characterised by:

- **Play-based, exploratory learning** following children's interests
- **Indoor and outdoor experiences** with natural materials and living things
- **Adult support** through sensitive interaction and rich environments
- **Development of vocabulary and observation skills** as foundations for later learning
- **Assessment through observation** of children's play and exploration

The goal is that by the end of Reception, children have developed curiosity about the natural world, the vocabulary to describe what they observe, and the confidence to explore and ask questions — essential foundations for the more structured science learning of key stage 1 and beyond.
