# Physics Knowledge: Forces, Energy, Waves, Electricity, Magnetism, and Space

## Overview and Purpose

Physics provides the foundational understanding of how the universe behaves, from the smallest subatomic particles to the vastness of space. The national curriculum for physics in England is structured progressively across key stages, building from exploratory observation in the early years to sophisticated mathematical modelling at GCSE and beyond. This document outlines the statutory content, pedagogical approaches, common misconceptions, and progression pathways for teaching physics effectively across primary and secondary education.

The study of physics in schools serves multiple purposes: developing scientific literacy for all pupils, preparing future scientists and engineers, and cultivating analytical thinking skills that transfer across disciplines. According to the Department for Education (2015), pupils should develop "scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding through the specific disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics" while also understanding "the nature, processes and methods of science."

## Forces and Motion

### Key Stage 1 Foundations

In Key Stage 1, pupils begin developing intuitive understandings of forces through direct experience. The statutory curriculum requires that pupils observe how objects move and begin to describe these movements using simple vocabulary. Teachers should provide opportunities for pupils to push and pull objects, observing how different strengths of force produce different effects.

The non-statutory guidance suggests that pupils explore questions such as: What happens when I push this toy car harder? Why does this ball roll down the slope? These investigations build foundational concepts that will later develop into formal understanding of Newton's laws. At this stage, the emphasis is on experiencing phenomena rather than explaining them theoretically.

### Key Stage 2 Development

By Key Stage 2, pupils encounter more explicit teaching about forces. The Year 5 programme of study requires that pupils understand:

- Gravity as a force that pulls objects towards the Earth
- The difference between contact forces (friction, air resistance, water resistance) and non-contact forces (magnetic forces, gravity)
- That unsupported objects fall towards the Earth because of gravity
- The effects of air resistance, water resistance, and friction
- That some mechanisms (including levers, pulleys, and gears) allow a smaller force to have a greater effect

The concept of gravity presents particular teaching challenges. Many pupils enter Year 5 believing that gravity requires air to function or that it only affects falling objects, not those at rest. The Institute of Physics (IOP) identifies this as one of the most persistent misconceptions in physics education. Effective teaching uses the "space context" — asking pupils to consider what would happen to objects on the Moon or in orbit — to challenge these naive conceptions.

Friction and air resistance investigations provide rich opportunities for enquiry-based learning. Pupils can design fair tests to compare how different surfaces affect movement or how the shape of an object influences its fall through the air. These investigations embed working scientifically skills while developing conceptual understanding.

### Key Stage 3 Progression

At Key Stage 3, forces teaching becomes more quantitative and systematic. The statutory programme requires pupils to understand:

- Speed and the quantitative relationship between average speed, distance, and time (speed = distance ÷ time)
- The representation of a journey on a distance-time graph
- Relative motion: objects moving in the same direction and objects moving in opposite directions
- Moment as the turning effect of a force
- Levers and gears as force multipliers
- Pressure in fluids at rest
- Atmospheric pressure and its changes with altitude

The introduction of distance-time graphs represents a significant cognitive demand, requiring pupils to translate between concrete motion and abstract representation. Research by the IOP suggests that many pupils struggle to interpret the gradient of such graphs, often confusing it with the height of the line. Careful sequencing of activities — starting with pupils creating graphs from their own movement data — helps build secure understanding.

The concept of moment (turning effect) provides a practical application of forces that connects to real-world contexts such as tools, doors, and playground equipment. Pupils should calculate moments using the equation: moment = force × distance, and understand the principle of moments in balanced situations.

Pressure teaching at KS3 builds on the particle model of matter introduced in chemistry. Pupils should understand that pressure in fluids results from particle collisions with surfaces and that pressure increases with depth due to the weight of fluid above. The relationship between pressure, force, and area (pressure = force ÷ area) should be applied to practical situations including snow shoes, sharp knives, and deep-sea exploration.

### GCSE Depth

GCSE physics (AQA specification 8463) extends forces understanding considerably:

**Scalars and Vectors:** Pupils must distinguish between scalar quantities (speed, distance, mass, temperature) and vector quantities (velocity, displacement, weight, force). They should represent vector quantities with both magnitude and direction, and calculate resultant forces using scale diagrams or trigonometry.

**Newton's Laws:** All three laws are studied in depth:
- First Law: Balanced forces result in constant velocity (including stationary objects)
- Second Law: Resultant force = mass × acceleration (F = ma)
- Third Law: Interaction pairs — forces are equal and opposite

The IOP emphasises that Newton's First Law presents the greatest conceptual challenge, as it contradicts everyday experience where friction invariably slows moving objects. Teaching should explicitly address the "motion implies force" misconception through thought experiments involving friction-free scenarios.

**Momentum:** Pupils calculate momentum (p = m × v) and apply the conservation of momentum to collisions and explosions. They should understand the relationship between force and rate of change of momentum, including its application to vehicle safety features.

**Circular Motion:** While not requiring detailed mathematical treatment, pupils should understand that circular motion requires a resultant force directed towards the centre of the circle, and apply this to satellites, planets, and fairground rides.

## Energy

### Key Stage 2 Introduction

Energy concepts enter the curriculum in Year 4, where pupils learn about sound and vibration, and are extended in Year 6 with the topic of light. However, the formal concept of energy as a quantitative, conserved quantity is not statutory until Key Stage 3. Year 6 pupils do encounter the idea that light travels from sources until it hits something, and that we see things when light from them enters our eyes.

### Key Stage 3 Foundations

The Key Stage 3 programme introduces energy as a central organising concept for physics. Pupils must understand:

- That energy is stored in a variety of ways and can be transferred from one store to another
- The calculation of mechanical work done (work = force × distance)
- The concept of power as the rate of energy transfer
- The quantitative relationship between work, power, and time
- That heating materials increases the energy stored within them
- The distinction between thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity
- That energy is always conserved in physical processes

The IOP and other physics education researchers have identified the "energy as a substance" misconception as particularly problematic. Many pupils conceive of energy as a tangible fluid that can be used up or stored in batteries like water in a tank. The modern "energy stores and pathways" approach, endorsed by the Association for Science Education and adopted in many GCSE specifications, addresses this by treating energy as a calculated quantity rather than a physical substance.

Under this framework, pupils identify energy stores (kinetic, gravitational potential, elastic potential, chemical, thermal, nuclear, electrostatic, magnetic) and pathways (mechanical working, electrical working, heating, radiation). Energy transfers are described as shifts between stores via pathways, with the total quantity remaining constant.

### GCSE Depth

GCSE physics requires sophisticated application of energy concepts:

**Kinetic and Potential Energy Calculations:**
- Kinetic energy: Eₖ = ½mv²
- Gravitational potential energy: Eₚ = mgh
- Elastic potential energy: Eₑ = ½ke² (for springs)

Pupils apply these equations to solve problems involving falling objects, rolling vehicles, and oscillating systems. They should understand that for a falling object, gravitational potential energy converts to kinetic energy (assuming negligible air resistance), and calculate maximum speeds using conservation principles.

**Specific Heat Capacity:** Pupils perform the required practical investigation to determine the specific heat capacity of materials. They should understand that different materials require different amounts of energy to raise their temperature by a given amount, and apply this to contexts including building materials, cooking, and thermal management in technology.

**Energy Resources:** The full range of energy resources is studied, including:
- Fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas)
- Nuclear fuels (uranium, plutonium)
- Biofuels
- Wind, hydro-electricity, geothermal, tidal, solar, and water waves

For each resource, pupils evaluate advantages and disadvantages considering reliability, environmental impact, start-up times, and cost. They should understand the distinction between renewable and non-renewable resources and the importance of energy security.

**Power and Efficiency:** The quantitative relationships are developed:
- Power = energy transferred ÷ time
- Efficiency = useful energy output ÷ total energy input

Pupils calculate efficiency as a decimal or percentage and understand why no device can be 100% efficient due to the Second Law of Thermodynamics (though this law is not named at GCSE).

## Waves

### Key Stage 2 Foundations

Waves concepts begin with the study of sound and light in Years 4-6. Pupils learn that:
- Sounds are produced by vibrations and travel through media to the ear
- Light travels in straight lines and reflects off surfaces
- We see things when light from them enters our eyes
- Shadows are formed when light is blocked
- Light from the Sun can be dangerous and protection is needed

These foundational experiences provide the concrete basis for later abstract understanding. The IOP recommends extensive practical work with tuning forks, string telephones, and ripple tanks to establish the relationship between vibration and sound before formal wave terminology is introduced.

### Key Stage 3 Progression

The Key Stage 3 programme requires pupils to understand:
- The properties of waves: amplitude, wavelength, frequency, period, and wave speed
- The wave equation: wave speed = frequency × wavelength (v = fλ)
- The distinction between transverse and longitudinal waves
- Sound waves as longitudinal and electromagnetic waves as transverse
- The electromagnetic spectrum and its uses
- That light travels at finite speed and the approximate speed of light

The wave equation represents a significant step in mathematical demand. Pupils must manipulate the equation to find any variable given the other two, and apply it to problems involving sound, light, and water waves. Common errors include confusing frequency with amplitude and failing to convert between metres and kilometres or between hertz and kilohertz.

The electromagnetic spectrum is taught as a continuous range of waves with common properties (transverse, travel at speed of light in vacuum, can travel through vacuum) but different wavelengths, frequencies, and energies. Pupils should know the order of the spectrum (radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays) and typical uses and hazards associated with each region.

Sound wave teaching emphasises that sound requires a medium and cannot travel through a vacuum. Pupils should understand the relationship between frequency and pitch, and between amplitude and loudness. The structure and function of the ear may be taught as an application.

### GCSE Depth

GCSE physics extends wave understanding substantially:

**Reflection and Refraction:** Pupils apply the law of reflection (angle of incidence = angle of reflection) and understand refraction as wave speed change at media boundaries. They should explain why a swimming pool appears shallower than it is and how lenses form images.

**Wave Behaviour:** Diffraction and interference are introduced, though at a qualitative level. Pupils should understand that waves spread out when passing through gaps or around obstacles, and that this explains why radio waves can be received in tunnels while TV signals cannot.

**Electromagnetic Wave Properties:** The full quantitative treatment includes:
- Calculating frequency or wavelength given the other and the wave speed
- Understanding that higher frequency waves carry more energy per photon
- Explaining ionisation and heating effects in terms of energy transfer

**Uses and Dangers:** Detailed knowledge is required of applications including:
- Radio waves: communications including Bluetooth, WiFi, broadcasting
- Microwaves: cooking, mobile communications, satellite transmissions
- Infrared: thermal imaging, remote controls, optical fibre communications
- Visible light: photography, vision, illumination
- Ultraviolet: sterilisation, fluorescence, security marking
- X-rays: medical imaging, airport security, crystallography
- Gamma rays: medical treatment (radiotherapy), sterilisation of food and equipment

For each, pupils must balance benefits against risks, considering duration and intensity of exposure.

## Electricity

### Key Stage 1 and 2 Foundations

Electricity appears in the curriculum through the study of everyday applications and simple circuits. By the end of Key Stage 2, pupils should:
- Associate the brightness of a lamp or the volume of a buzzer with the number and voltage of cells used in the circuit
- Compare and give reasons for variations in how components function, including the brightness of bulbs, the loudness of buzzers, and the on/off position of switches
- Use recognised symbols when representing a simple circuit in a diagram

The required practical work at KS2 involves constructing simple series circuits and predicting whether a lamp will light in various circuit configurations. Pupils commonly hold the "clashing currents" model, where they believe electricity flows from both terminals of a battery and "clashes" in the bulb to produce light. This misconception must be explicitly addressed before more advanced teaching.

### Key Stage 3 Development

Key Stage 3 introduces more formal circuit analysis and the quantitative relationships:

- Current as rate of flow of charge
- Potential difference as energy transferred per unit charge
- Resistance as opposition to current flow
- Ohm's Law: V = IR
- Series and parallel circuit behaviour
- Power in electrical circuits: P = IV

The distinction between series and parallel circuits represents a major conceptual milestone. In series circuits, current is constant while potential difference divides proportionally to resistance. In parallel circuits, potential difference is constant across branches while current divides. Pupils must apply these principles to predict circuit behaviour and calculate unknown values.

The IOP identifies the "sequential" model as a common misconception: pupils believe current is "used up" by components, leading to predictions that the second bulb in a series circuit will be dimmer than the first. The rope model (where teachers demonstrate current as continuous loop with pupils representing charges) can help establish the conservation of current.

Domestic electricity is taught at KS3, including:
- The function of live, neutral, and earth wires
- The dangers of mains electricity
- The role of fuses and circuit breakers in protection
- The relationship between power, current, and the rating of fuses

### GCSE Depth

GCSE physics treats electricity as one of the most mathematically demanding topics:

**Quantitative Relationships:** All equations must be applied fluently:
- Q = It (charge = current × time)
- V = IR (Ohm's Law)
- P = IV = I²R = V²/R (power)
- E = Pt = IVt (energy transferred)

**I-V Characteristics:** Pupils perform the required practical to investigate I-V characteristics of resistor, filament lamp, and diode. They should explain these characteristics in terms of resistance and temperature (for the filament lamp) and the one-way conduction of the diode.

**Resistance:** The factors affecting resistance are studied:
- Resistance increases with length (R ∝ L)
- Resistance decreases with cross-sectional area (R ∝ 1/A)
- Resistivity: ρ = RA/L (higher tier only)
- Resistance increases with temperature for metals (due to increased lattice vibrations)
- Resistance decreases with temperature for thermistors
- Light-dependent resistors (LDRs) decrease resistance with increasing light intensity

**Circuit Analysis:** Complex circuits with combinations of series and parallel elements must be analysed to calculate total resistance, branch currents, and component potential differences.

## Magnetism and Electromagnetism

### Key Stage 1 and 2 Foundations

Magnetism is taught in Year 3 (forces and magnets) and Year 5 (properties and changes of materials). Pupils learn that:
- Magnetic forces act at a distance, unlike most contact forces
- Magnets have two poles that attract or repel each other
- Some materials are magnetic (iron, nickel, cobalt) while most are not
- The Earth has a magnetic field that allows compass navigation
- Magnets can attract or repel without touching

Practical investigations involve testing materials for magnetic properties, finding the strongest parts of a magnet, and using compasses to detect magnetic fields. The non-contact nature of magnetic forces provides an important contrast to the contact forces (friction, air resistance) that dominate pupils' early force experiences.

### Key Stage 3 Progression

Key Stage 3 extends magnetism teaching to include:
- The magnetic field around permanent magnets and the Earth
- The magnetic effect of an electric current (electromagnetism)
- The construction and operation of electromagnets
- The magnetic field of a solenoid
- The force on a conductor in a magnetic field (motor effect)

The relationship between electricity and magnetism — that electric currents create magnetic fields — is one of the most significant unifying concepts in physics. Pupils construct electromagnets and investigate how to increase their strength (more turns, larger current, ferrous core). They should understand that electromagnets allow magnetic effects to be switched on and off, making them suitable for applications including cranes, circuit breakers, and MRI scanners.

The motor effect (force on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field) is introduced, though detailed F = BIL calculations are not required until GCSE. Pupils should understand the principles of electric motors and how the commutator reverses current to maintain rotation.

### GCSE Depth

GCSE physics treats electromagnetism as a major topic with substantial mathematical content:

**Permanent and Induced Magnetism:** Pupils distinguish between permanent magnets (made of magnetically hard materials like steel) and induced magnets (magnetically soft materials like iron that magnetise in a field but lose magnetism when removed).

**Magnetic Fields:** Field patterns are studied for bar magnets, current-carrying wires, and solenoids. Pupils should sketch these patterns and understand field strength represented by line density.

**Electromagnetic Induction:** The generator effect is studied in depth — that relative motion between a conductor and magnetic field induces a potential difference. Factors affecting the size of induced potential difference include:
- Strength of magnetic field
