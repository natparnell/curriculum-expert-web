# Cell Biology and Organisation: From Living Things to Cell Specialisation

This knowledge file covers the progression of cell biology and organisation concepts from the Early Years Foundation Stage through to Key Stage 5 (A-Level). It explores how pupils develop understanding of cells as the fundamental units of life, the hierarchical organisation of multicellular organisms, and the relationship between structure and function at cellular, tissue, and organ levels.

## Foundational Concepts: The Nature of Living Things

### What Makes Something 'Living'?

Before pupils encounter cells as abstract concepts, they must first understand what distinguishes living things from non-living matter. The Ofsted Research Review: Science (2021) emphasises that pupils need secure foundations in the characteristics of living things before they can meaningfully engage with cellular biology.

#### The MRS GREN Framework

The traditional acronym MRS GREN provides a memorable framework for the seven characteristics shared by all living organisms:

- **Movement** – changing position or location
- **Respiration** – releasing energy from food
- **Sensitivity** – detecting and responding to changes in the environment
- **Growth** – increasing in size or cell number
- **Reproduction** – producing offspring
- **Excretion** – removing waste products
- **Nutrition** – taking in materials for energy and growth

In the EYFS and Key Stage 1, pupils explore these characteristics through direct observation of plants and animals. They observe that a puppy grows while a teddy bear does not; that a bird responds to danger while a toy does not. These concrete experiences establish the foundation for later understanding that all these life processes ultimately occur at the cellular level.

#### Common Misconceptions in Early Understanding

Research consistently identifies several misconceptions that pupils hold about living things:

- **The 'movement' misconception**: Many pupils associate movement with being alive, leading them to classify vehicles, wind, and fire as living. Teachers must emphasise that movement is only one criterion and must be accompanied by other characteristics.

- **The 'need' misconception**: Pupils often confuse 'needs' (water, light) with characteristics of life. A car needs petrol but is not alive; a plant needs water and is alive. The distinction between needs and life processes must be made explicit.

- **Plant blindness**: Pupils frequently demonstrate a human-centric view, readily identifying animals as living but struggling to apply the same criteria to plants. Ofsted (2021) notes that this tendency can persist into secondary school if not actively challenged.

### Progression from Organisms to Cells

The National Curriculum in England introduces cells explicitly at Key Stage 3, but the conceptual groundwork is laid much earlier. The Oak National Academy primary science curriculum, aligned with the DfE's programmes of study, emphasises that pupils should learn about organisms using common processes (such as the criteria for life) before being introduced to cells and cell structures.

#### EYFS: The Seeds of Understanding

In the Early Years Foundation Stage, the Understanding the World area of learning provides the first encounters with biological concepts. Through the Natural World strand, children explore:

- Changes and living things (through topics like 'Ourselves' and 'Growth')
- The natural environment and living things within it
- Similarities and differences between living things

While the word 'cell' does not appear in EYFS documentation, children are building the perceptual and conceptual foundations they will need. They learn that living things grow, that they have parts with different functions (petals, leaves, roots), and that there is organisation in the natural world. These early experiences of pattern and structure foreshadow later understanding of biological organisation.

## The Cell: The Fundamental Unit of Life

### Historical Development of Cell Theory

Understanding how our knowledge of cells developed helps pupils appreciate science as a human endeavour and models how scientific understanding evolves. The cell theory emerged over centuries through the work of many scientists:

#### The Invention of Microscopy

The story of cell discovery begins with the development of microscopy. In the 1660s, Robert Hooke observed cork through a compound microscope and saw what he described as 'little boxes' or 'cells'—in fact, the cell walls of dead plant tissue. Around the same time, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek developed powerful single-lens microscopes and observed living 'animalcules' in pond water, sperm cells, and blood cells.

These early observations established that the natural world contained structures invisible to the naked eye. However, the significance of cells as the fundamental units of life was not immediately apparent.

#### The Formulation of Cell Theory

By the 1830s, improved microscopes enabled Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann to propose that all plants and animals are composed of cells. Rudolf Virchow added the crucial third tenet: that all cells arise from pre-existing cells (Omnis cellula e cellula).

Modern cell theory comprises three principles:
1. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells
2. The cell is the basic unit of structure and organisation in organisms
3. All cells come from pre-existing cells

### Cell Structure: The Universal Features

All cells, whether from bacteria, plants, or humans, share certain fundamental features. Understanding these universal structures provides the foundation for exploring the differences between cell types.

#### The Cell Membrane (Plasma Membrane)

Every cell is bounded by a selectively permeable membrane that separates the cell's internal environment from the external world. The fluid mosaic model describes this structure as a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins.

**Key functions of the cell membrane:**
- **Selective permeability**: Controlling what enters and exits the cell
- **Cell signalling**: Receiving chemical signals from other cells
- **Cell recognition**: Identifying the cell as 'self' or identifying other cells
- **Structural support**: Anchoring the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix

In teaching, the cell membrane can be modelled using various analogies:
- A security gate that checks credentials before allowing entry
- A sieve that lets small particles through but blocks larger ones
- A border control that regulates traffic across a boundary

#### The Cytoplasm

The cytoplasm comprises the cytosol (the gel-like fluid filling the cell) and the organelles suspended within it. It is the site of many metabolic reactions, particularly glycolysis and protein synthesis.

**Key characteristics of cytoplasm:**
- Contains dissolved nutrients, salts, and waste products
- Provides the medium in which chemical reactions occur
- Contains the cytoskeleton, providing structural support and enabling movement
- Site of translation (protein synthesis from mRNA)

#### Genetic Material (DNA)

All cells contain genetic material that carries the instructions for building and operating the cell. In prokaryotic cells (bacteria and archaea), DNA exists as a single circular chromosome in the cytoplasm. In eukaryotic cells (plants, animals, fungi, protists), DNA is contained within a membrane-bound nucleus.

**The significance of DNA:**
- Carries the genetic code that determines cell structure and function
- Provides instructions for protein synthesis
- Is replicated before cell division to pass genetic information to daughter cells
- Contains genes that can be 'switched on' or 'off' to control cell activities

#### Ribosomes

Ribosomes are the protein factories of the cell. These small organelles read messenger RNA (mRNA) and assemble amino acids into proteins according to the genetic code. Ribosomes are found in all cells, reflecting the universal importance of protein synthesis to life.

**Ribosome structure and function:**
- Composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins
- Read mRNA in groups of three nucleotides (codons)
- Catalyse the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids
- Found either free in the cytoplasm or attached to the endoplasmic reticulum

### Distinguishing Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells

A fundamental distinction in cell biology is between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. This distinction reflects a major evolutionary divergence and has profound implications for cell structure, function, and organisation.

#### Prokaryotic Cells

Prokaryotic cells (from Greek 'pro' = before, 'karyon' = kernel/nucleus) are simpler in structure and lack membrane-bound organelles.

**Key features of prokaryotic cells:**
- No nucleus; DNA is free in the cytoplasm
- No membrane-bound organelles (mitochondria, chloroplasts, etc.)
- Cell wall present in most (made of peptidoglycan in bacteria)
- Much smaller than eukaryotic cells (typically 0.5-5 μm)
- Include bacteria and archaea
- May have flagella for movement
- Often have plasmids (small circular DNA molecules)

#### Eukaryotic Cells

Eukaryotic cells (from Greek 'eu' = true, 'karyon' = kernel/nucleus) are more complex, with a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.

**Key features of eukaryotic cells:**
- True nucleus containing DNA
- Multiple membrane-bound organelles with specialised functions
- Generally larger than prokaryotic cells (typically 10-100 μm)
- Include all animal, plant, fungal, and protist cells
- More complex internal organisation
- Linear chromosomes rather than circular DNA

#### The Endosymbiotic Theory

The presence of mitochondria and chloroplasts in eukaryotic cells—organelles with their own DNA and double membranes—supports the endosymbiotic theory. This theory proposes that these organelles originated as free-living prokaryotes that were engulfed by ancestral eukaryotic cells and established a symbiotic relationship. The evidence includes:

- Mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own circular DNA
- They have double membranes (original cell membrane plus engulfing membrane)
- They reproduce by binary fission, like bacteria
- They have their own ribosomes, similar to prokaryotic ribosomes
- Their size is comparable to bacteria

## Plant and Animal Cell Specialisation

### Plant Cell Structures

Plant cells possess several structures not found in animal cells, reflecting their different way of life (autotrophic, photosynthetic, sessile).

#### The Cell Wall

Plant cells are surrounded by a rigid cell wall outside the cell membrane. This wall is composed primarily of cellulose, a complex carbohydrate.

**Functions of the cell wall:**
- **Structural support**: Providing rigidity and maintaining cell shape
- **Protection**: Defending against mechanical damage and pathogens
- **Prevention of excessive water uptake**: The wall resists the turgor pressure that builds when water enters the cell by osmosis

In teaching, the cell wall can be distinguished from the cell membrane by emphasising that it is fully permeable (unlike the selectively permeable membrane) and provides structural rather than regulatory functions.

#### The Vacuole

Mature plant cells typically contain a large central vacuole that can occupy up to 90% of the cell volume. This structure is much smaller or absent in animal cells.

**Functions of the vacuole:**
- **Storage**: Storing water, nutrients, waste products, and pigments
- **Turgor pressure**: Maintaining pressure against the cell wall to keep the plant rigid
- **Cellular digestion**: Containing enzymes that break down macromolecules
- **pH regulation**: Helping maintain cellular pH

#### Chloroplasts

Chloroplasts are the organelles of photosynthesis, containing the green pigment chlorophyll that captures light energy. They are found in plant cells and algae but not in animal cells.

**Structure and function of chloroplasts:**
- Double membrane structure
- Internal membrane system (thylakoids) arranged in stacks called grana
- Stroma (fluid-filled space) containing enzymes for the Calvin cycle
- Own DNA and ribosomes (supporting endosymbiotic theory)
- Site of photosynthesis: converting light energy into chemical energy (glucose)

### Animal Cell Structures

While animal cells lack cell walls, chloroplasts, and large vacuoles, they possess certain structures not found in plant cells.

#### Centrioles

Centrioles are cylindrical structures involved in cell division. They help organise the microtubules that separate chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis.

**Functions of centrioles:**
- Organising the spindle fibres during cell division
- Anchoring the cytoskeleton
- Forming the base of cilia and flagella

Centrioles are absent in higher plant cells but present in most animal cells.

#### Lysosomes

Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles containing digestive enzymes. They break down waste materials, damaged organelles, and foreign invaders.

**Functions of lysosomes:**
- Digesting worn-out organelles (autophagy)
- Breaking down macromolecules for recycling
- Destroying pathogens that enter the cell
- Programmed cell death (apoptosis)

While plant cells have some lysosomal activity, they do not have distinct lysosome organelles as animal cells do.

### Other Eukaryotic Cell Types

Understanding the diversity of cell types helps pupils appreciate the relationship between structure and function.

#### Fungal Cells

Fungal cells share features with both plant and animal cells:
- Have cell walls (like plants), but made of chitin (like arthropod exoskeletons)
- Lack chloroplasts (like animals)
- Store glycogen as an energy reserve (like animals, not starch like plants)
- Heterotrophic nutrition (like animals)

## Microscopy: Tools for Cell Biology

### The Light Microscope

The light microscope remains the fundamental tool for observing cells in schools. Understanding how microscopes work and their limitations is essential for practical cell biology.

#### How Light Microscopes Work

Light microscopes use visible light and glass lenses to magnify specimens. The basic components include:

- **Eyepiece lens**: Usually 10× magnification
- **Objective lenses**: Typically 4×, 10×, 40×, and sometimes 100× (oil immersion)
- **Stage**: Platform where the specimen is placed
- **Condenser**: Focuses light onto the specimen
- **Light source**: Illuminates the specimen from below

**Total magnification** = eyepiece magnification × objective magnification

#### Preparing Specimens

Proper specimen preparation is crucial for successful microscopy:

- **Wet mounts**: Used for living or preserved specimens in liquid
- **Staining**: Adding dyes (such as iodine or methylene blue) to increase contrast
- **Sectioning**: Cutting thin slices for light to pass through

Common stains include:
- **Iodine solution**: Stains starch grains blue-black and nuclei brown
- **Methylene blue**: Stains nuclei and other acidic structures
- **Eosin**: Stains cytoplasm and extracellular matrix pink

#### Limitations of Light Microscopy

The light microscope has significant limitations that pupils must understand:

- **Resolution limit**: Approximately 200 nanometres (0.2 μm). Objects closer together than this cannot be distinguished as separate.
- **Magnification limit**: Maximum useful magnification is around ×1500
- **Cannot see**: Ribosomes, viruses, DNA strands, or membrane details

These limitations arise from the wavelength of visible light. To see smaller structures, electron microscopy is required.

### Electron Microscopy

Electron microscopes use beams of electrons rather than light, providing much higher resolution and magnification.

#### Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)

TEM transmits electrons through ultra-thin sections of specimens.

**Characteristics of TEM:**
- Resolution: approximately 0.2 nanometres (1 million times better than light microscopy)
- Magnification: up to ×2,000,000
- Produces 2D images of internal structures
- Requires specimens to be dead and prepared in a vacuum
- Shows organelles, membrane structures, and viruses

#### Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)

SEM scans the specimen surface with an electron beam.

**Characteristics of SEM:**
- Resolution: approximately 1 nanometre
- Produces 3D-like surface images
- Shows surface details and textures
- Also requires dead specimens in vacuum
- Useful for viewing cell surfaces, microorganisms, and small organisms

#### Comparing Microscope Types

| Feature | Light Microscope | TEM | SEM |
|---------|-----------------|-----|-----|
| Radiation source | Visible light | Electrons | Electrons |
| Lenses | Glass | Electromagnets | Electromagnets |
| Maximum resolution | 200 nm | 0.2 nm | 1 nm |
| Maximum magnification | ×1500 | ×2,000,000 | ×1,000,000 |
| Colour images? | Yes | No (false colour added) | No (false colour added) |
| Living specimens? | Yes | No | No |
| 2D or 3D? | 2D | 2D | 3D appearance |

### Calculations in Microscopy

Pupils should be able to perform standard calculations:

**Magnification:**
Magnification = Image size / Actual size

**Actual size:**
Actual size = Image size / Magnification

**Image size:**
Image size = Actual size × Magnification

Unit conversions are essential:
- 1 mm = 1000 μm (micrometres)
- 1 μm = 1000 nm (nanometres)
- 1 mm = 1,000,000 nm

## Cell Specialisation and Differentiation

### Stem Cells

Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that can divide to produce more stem cells or differentiate into specialised cell types. Understanding stem cells is fundamental to developmental biology and has significant medical applications.

#### Types of Stem Cells

**Embryonic stem cells:**
- Found in early embryos (blastocysts)
- Pluripotent: can differentiate into any cell type in the body
- Have significant therapeutic potential but raise ethical concerns
- Can divide indefinitely in culture

**Adult (somatic) stem cells:**
- Found in tissues throughout the body (bone marrow, skin, gut, brain)
- Multipotent: can differentiate into a limited range of cell types
