## 1. Overview: Chemistry in the National Curriculum

Chemistry, though not named as such until Key Stage 3, begins in the earliest years of education through exploration of materials and their properties. The Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) notes that fundamental topics such as changing states and properties of materials lay the essential foundations of chemistry throughout primary schooling.

### 1.1 Statutory Requirements by Key Stage

| Key Stage | Programme of Study Focus | Chemistry Content |
|-----------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| EYFS | Understanding the World | Exploration of materials through sensory play |
| KS1 | Working Scientifically | Identifying and classifying materials by simple properties |
| KS2 | Properties and Changes of Materials | States of matter, reversible and irreversible changes |
| KS3 | Chemistry as a distinct subject | Particles, elements, compounds, reactions, atomic structure |
| KS4 (GCSE) | Chemistry or Combined Science | Detailed atomic theory, quantitative chemistry, organic chemistry |

The progression from descriptive study of observable phenomena to explanatory models involving invisible particles represents one of the most significant conceptual leaps pupils make in science education.

## 2. Materials and Their Properties (KS1-KS2)

### 2.1 Classification of Materials

At Key Stage 1, pupils learn to distinguish materials by their observable characteristics. The focus is on developing vocabulary and systematic observation skills.

**Key Material Categories:**
- **Metals** – typically shiny, hard, conduct heat and electricity
- **Wood** – natural, fibrous, varied hardness
- **Plastics** – synthetic, varied properties, mouldable
- **Glass** – transparent, brittle, smooth
- **Fabrics/textiles** – flexible, woven, varied textures
- **Stone/rock** – hard, heavy, natural
- **Paper/card** – plant-based, varied thickness

### 2.2 Material Properties

Pupils should develop understanding of:

**Physical Properties:**
- Hardness (scratch resistance)
- Flexibility (bendability)
- Transparency (see-through quality)
- Waterproof qualities
- Texture (smooth/rough)
- Magnetic properties

**Working Scientifically in KS1:**
Pupils engage in simple comparative tests, such as investigating which material would be best for a specific purpose (e.g., waterproof material for an umbrella). This develops the foundational idea that materials have different properties suited to different uses.

### 2.3 Changing Materials in KS2

The Key Stage 2 programme of study requires pupils to understand that some changes result in the formation of new materials, and that this kind of change is not usually reversible.

**Reversible Changes (Physical Changes):**
- Melting and freezing
- Dissolving and evaporating
- Bending and twisting
- Stretching and compressing

**Irreversible Changes (Chemical Changes):**
- Burning (combustion)
- Rusting (oxidation)
- Cooking (protein denaturation, caramelisation)
- Mixing certain materials (e.g., vinegar and bicarbonate of soda)

### 2.4 Separation Techniques

By Upper KS2, pupils encounter methods of separating mixtures:
- **Filtering** – separating insoluble solids from liquids
- **Evaporation** – recovering dissolved solids from solutions
- **Sieving** – separating by particle size
- **Magnetic separation** – using magnetism to separate magnetic materials
- **Decanting** – pouring off liquid to leave sediment

These techniques underpin later understanding of pure substances versus mixtures at KS3.

## 3. States of Matter (KS1-KS3)

### 3.1 The Three Common States

Understanding states of matter progresses from descriptive observations in primary years to particle-level explanations in secondary science.

**Solids:**
- Fixed shape and volume
- Particles arranged in regular patterns (crystalline) or irregular arrangements (amorphous)
- Particles vibrate about fixed positions
- Strong forces of attraction between particles

**Liquids:**
- Fixed volume but no fixed shape (takes shape of container)
- Particles close together but able to move past one another
- Particles move randomly
- Moderate forces of attraction between particles

**Gases:**
- No fixed shape or volume (fills container)
- Particles far apart and move rapidly in all directions
- Negligible forces of attraction between particles
- Pressure caused by particles colliding with container walls (BBC Bitesize)

### 3.2 Changes of State

The transitions between states involve changes in particle energy and arrangement:

| Process | Energy Change | Particle Behaviour |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Melting | Heat energy absorbed | Particles gain energy, break from fixed positions |
| Freezing | Heat energy released | Particles lose energy, form fixed positions |
| Boiling | Heat energy absorbed | Particles gain sufficient energy to escape as gas |
| Condensing | Heat energy released | Particles lose energy, come closer together |
| Sublimation | Heat energy absorbed | Solid directly to gas (e.g., dry ice) |

### 3.3 The Particle Model

By Key Stage 3, pupils must understand the particle model of matter:
- All matter is made of tiny particles (atoms, molecules, ions)
- Particles are in constant motion
- The arrangement and motion of particles determines the state
- Temperature affects particle energy and motion

**Teaching the Particle Model:**
Research published in the Journal of Chemical Education describes common stages in student thinking about particles:
1. **Continuous matter** – thinking of materials as continuous substances
2. **Particles embedded in a continuous medium** – particles floating in a substance
3. **Particles as small pieces of macroscopic matter** – miniature versions of bulk material
4. **Distinct interacting particles** – correct understanding of atoms/molecules as the fundamental units

Teachers should diagnose which stage pupils are at and scaffold learning accordingly.

## 4. Elements, Compounds, and Mixtures (KS3-KS4)

### 4.1 Elements

An element is a substance consisting of only one type of atom. There are approximately 100 naturally occurring elements that combine in various ways to form all matter in the universe.

**Key Concepts:**
- Elements cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means
- Each element has a unique atomic number (number of protons)
- Elements can exist as atoms (e.g., noble gases) or molecules (e.g., O₂, N₂)

### 4.2 Compounds

A compound is formed when two or more elements chemically combine in fixed proportions. The resulting substance has properties different from the constituent elements.

**Examples:**
- Water (H₂O) – hydrogen and oxygen
- Carbon dioxide (CO₂) – carbon and oxygen
- Sodium chloride (NaCl) – sodium and chlorine
- Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) – carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen

### 4.3 Mixtures

A mixture contains two or more substances (elements or compounds) not chemically combined. Mixtures can be separated by physical means.

**Types of Mixtures:**
- **Solutions** – solute dissolved in solvent (e.g., salt water)
- **Suspensions** – solid particles dispersed in liquid (e.g., muddy water)
- **Colloids** – particles intermediate in size between solutions and suspensions
- **Alloys** – mixtures of metals (e.g., bronze, steel)

### 4.4 Representing Chemical Substances

At KS3, pupils learn to represent substances using chemical formulae and equations:

**Chemical Formulae:**
- Show the elements present and their ratios
- Use subscripts to indicate numbers of atoms
- Examples: H₂O, CO₂, Fe₂O₃

**Word Equations (KS3):**
- Reactants → Products
- Example: hydrogen + oxygen → water

**Symbol Equations (KS4):**
- Use chemical formulae and balance atom counts
- Example: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O

## 5. The Periodic Table (KS3-KS4)

### 5.1 Organisation of the Periodic Table

The periodic table arranges elements by atomic number (proton number) in such a way that elements with similar properties appear in vertical columns called groups.

**Key Features:**
- **Periods** – horizontal rows (7 periods)
- **Groups** – vertical columns numbered 1-18 or 0/IUPAC system
- **Metals** – left side and centre (majority of elements)
- **Non-metals** – right side
- **Metalloids/semi-metals** – staircase dividing line (e.g., silicon, germanium)

### 5.2 Historical Development

Understanding how the periodic table developed helps pupils appreciate its significance:

**Mendeleev's Breakthrough (1869):**
- Arranged elements by atomic mass
- Left gaps for undiscovered elements
- Predicted properties of missing elements
- Grouped elements by chemical behaviour

**Modern Periodic Law:**
The arrangement of elements in the modern periodic table can be explained in terms of atomic structure, providing evidence for the model of a nuclear atom with electrons in energy levels (AQA specification).

### 5.3 Group Properties

**Group 1 – Alkali Metals:**
- Highly reactive metals
- React vigorously with water
- Form 1+ ions
- Reactivity increases down the group

**Group 7 – Halogens:**
- Reactive non-metals
- Form diatomic molecules (F₂, Cl₂, Br₂, I₂)
- Form 1- ions
- Reactivity decreases down the group

**Group 0/18 – Noble Gases:**
- Unreactive (full outer electron shells)
- Monatomic gases
- Used in lighting and as inert atmospheres

### 5.4 Trends Across Periods

Key trends pupils should understand:
- Metallic character decreases across a period
- Atomic radius decreases across a period (increased nuclear charge)
- Transition metals form coloured compounds and have variable oxidation states

## 6. Chemical Reactions (KS3-KS4)

### 6.1 Identifying Chemical Change

Chemical reactions can be identified by:
- Temperature change (exothermic or endothermic)
- Colour change
- Gas production (effervescence)
- Precipitate formation (solid appearing in solution)
- Change in pH

### 6.2 Types of Chemical Reaction

**Combustion:**
- Substance reacts with oxygen
- Releases energy (exothermic)
- Complete combustion produces CO₂ and H₂O (for hydrocarbons)

**Thermal Decomposition:**
- Single compound breaks down when heated
- Example: calcium carbonate → calcium oxide + carbon dioxide

**Oxidation and Reduction:**
- Oxidation – gain of oxygen or loss of electrons
- Reduction – loss of oxygen or gain of electrons
- These processes always occur together (redox reactions)

**Neutralisation:**
- Acid + base → salt + water
- pH moves towards 7
- Used in treating acid indigestion, soil treatment

### 6.3 Acids, Bases, and Alkalis

**Acids:**
- pH less than 7
- Contain hydrogen ions (H⁺) in solution
- Strong acids fully dissociate; weak acids partially dissociate

**Bases:**
- Substances that neutralise acids
- Include metal oxides, hydroxides, and carbonates
- Alkalis are soluble bases

**The pH Scale:**
- 0-6: acidic
- 7: neutral
- 8-14: alkaline

### 6.4 Reactivity Series

The reactivity series ranks metals by their reactivity:

Most reactive: Potassium → Sodium → Calcium → Magnesium → Aluminium → Zinc → Iron → Tin → Lead → Hydrogen → Copper → Silver → Gold → Platinum: Least reactive

**Applications:**
- Displacement reactions (more reactive metal displaces less reactive)
- Extraction methods (more reactive metals need electrolysis)
- Corrosion prevention

---

## 7. Atomic Structure (KS4)

### 7.1 The Nuclear Model

By GCSE, pupils must understand the nuclear model of the atom:

**Subatomic Particles:**
| Particle | Relative Mass | Relative Charge | Location |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| Proton | 1 | +1 | Nucleus |
| Neutron | 1 | 0 | Nucleus |
| Electron | 1/1836 (negligible) | -1 | Electron shells |

**Key Relationships:**
- Atomic number = number of protons
- Mass number = protons + neutrons
- In a neutral atom, protons = electrons

### 7.2 Electronic Structure

Electrons occupy discrete energy levels (shells) around the nucleus:

**Shell Capacity:**
- 1st shell: maximum 2 electrons
- 2nd shell: maximum 8 electrons
- 3rd shell: maximum 8 electrons (simplified KS4 model)

**Writing Electronic Configuration:**
- Example: Sodium (atomic number 11) → 2.8.1
- Example: Chlorine (atomic number 17) → 2.8.7

### 7.3 Ions and Bonding

**Formation of Ions:**
- Atoms gain or lose electrons to achieve stable electron configurations
- Metals lose electrons to form positive ions (cations)
- Non-metals gain electrons to form negative ions (anions)

**Ionic Bonding:**
- Electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions
- Forms giant ionic lattices (e.g., NaCl)
- High melting points, conduct electricity when molten or dissolved

**Covalent Bonding:**
- Sharing of electron pairs between atoms
- Can form simple molecules (e.g., H₂O, CO₂) or giant structures (e.g., diamond, graphite)

## 8. Progression Across Key Stages

### 8.1 The Progression Journey

| Age Phase | Conceptual Level | Key Ideas |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| 4-5 (EYFS) | Sensorimotor exploration | Materials have different textures, weights, appearances |
| 5-7 (KS1) | Descriptive classification | Materials have observable properties; materials are chosen for purposes |
| 7-11 (KS2) | Relational understanding | States of matter; reversible vs irreversible changes; separation techniques |
| 11-14 (KS3) | Particle model introduction | Particles explain properties; elements, compounds, mixtures; chemical reactions |
| 14-16 (KS4) | Abstract theoretical model | Atomic structure; bonding; quantitative chemistry; explaining trends |

### 8.2 Building Coherence

The Royal Society of Chemistry emphasises that through teaching fundamental topics in primary science, teachers are laying the foundations of chemistry. Effective progression requires:

**Primary-Secondary Transition:**
- KS3 teachers should know what pupils have experienced at KS2
- Build on particle ideas introduced through states of matter
- Revisit separation techniques before introducing pure substances

**Spiral Curriculum:**
- Revisit key ideas at increasing depth
- Particles → atoms → subatomic particles → quantum shells
- Materials → elements → compounds → bonding → reactions

## 9. Common Misconceptions in Chemistry

Research has identified widespread misconceptions that impede learning in chemistry. Teachers should explicitly address these.

### 9.1 Matter and Particles

**Misconception 1: Continuous Matter**
Pupils often think of materials as continuous substances rather than collections of particles. Research shows pupils find it very difficult to understand just how small atoms and molecules actually are.

**Misconception 2: Comparing Cells and Atoms**
A common error is thinking cells and atoms are comparable in size. In fact, cells contain millions of molecules (Open University TESSA materials).

**Misconception 3: Particle Properties**
Pupils often think particles possess the same properties as the materials they compose (e.g., water molecules being wet).

### 9.2 States of Matter

**Misconception 4: Relative Particle Spacing**
The relative particle spacing among solids, liquids, and gases (approximately 1:1:10) is incorrectly perceived and not generally related to the density of the states.

**Misconception 5: States as Types of Matter**
Some pupils think states of matter are different kinds of matter rather than the same matter in different arrangements.

**Misconception 6: Single-State Materials**
Materials can only exhibit properties of one state of matter (in reality, many substances exist in multiple states depending on conditions).

### 9.3 Chemical Change

**Misconception 7: Conservation of Mass**
Students have difficulty understanding the conservation of matter in open and closed-system chemical reactions. The law of conservation of matter is a cornerstone in the development of modern chemistry.

**Misconception 8: Disappearing Matter**
When materials burn or evaporate, pupils think the matter has disappeared rather than being transformed.

## 10. Pedagogical Approaches

### 10.1 Teaching Abstract Concepts

The shift from concrete, observable phenomena to abstract particle models presents challenges. Research from the American Chemical Society and Journal of Chemical Education suggests:

**Using Models and Analogies:**
- Use physical models (ball-and-stick, space-filling) alongside symbolic representations
- Employ analogies carefully, ensuring pupils know their limitations
- Use computer simulations to visualise particle behaviour

**Progressive Formalisation:**
- Begin with concrete experiences (states of matter experiments)
- Introduce simple particle explanations
- Gradually build towards formal atomic theory

**Addressing Misconceptions Explicitly:**
- Use predict-observe-explain strategies
- Encourage pupils to articulate their thinking
- Provide cognitive conflict through counter-examples

### 10.2 Practical Work in Chemistry

Practical work remains essential for developing understanding:

**Key Practical Techniques:**
- Filtration, evaporation, crystallisation
- Titration (neutralisation)
- Electrolysis
- Chromatography
- Calorimetry

**Safety Considerations:**
- Risk assessments for all practical work
- Appropriate PPE (goggles, lab coats)
- Proper handling of acids, bases, and reactive metals
- Safe use of Bunsen burners and heat sources

### 10.3 Assessment for Learning

Effective assessment in chemistry should probe conceptual understanding:

**Diagnostic Questions:**
- "What is between the particles in a gas?" (answer: nothing)
- "Does the total mass change during a chemical reaction?"
- "What happens to particles when water boils?"

** hinge Questions:**
Use multiple-choice questions where each wrong answer reveals a specific misconception, allowing immediate intervention.

## Key Takeaways for Teachers

1. **Chemistry begins early** – The foundations laid through materials work in EYFS and KS1 are crucial for later conceptual development.

2. **The particle model is a major threshold concept** – Pupils need extensive support to transition from continuous matter to particulate thinking.

3. **Progression is spiral** – Concepts should be revisited at increasing depth across key stages.

4. **Misconceptions are persistent** – Research shows that incorrect ideas about matter and particles are widespread and require explicit addressing.

5. **Practical work connects abstract ideas** – Hands-on experience with materials, states of matter, and reactions makes the invisible world of chemistry tangible.

6. **Language matters** – Careful use of terms like "particles" (rather than "molecules" or "atoms" when introducing the concept) supports gradual conceptual development.

## 12. Curriculum Planning and Sequencing

### 12.1 Sequencing Principles

Effective chemistry curricula follow clear sequencing principles that build conceptual understanding progressively:

**Macroscopic to Microscopic:**
Begin with observable phenomena (materials, states of matter, reactions) before introducing explanatory models (particles, atoms, bonding).

**Concrete to Abstract:**
Use physical models, analogies, and simulations before formal symbolic representations (equations, formulae).

**Qualitative to Quantitative:**
Start with descriptive understanding before introducing calculations (moles, concentrations, yields).

### 12.2 Big Ideas in Chemistry

The RSC identifies key organising concepts that should thread through the curriculum:

**Big Idea 1: Substances and Properties**
All matter is made of particles, and the properties of substances depend on the particles present and how they are arranged and bonded.

**Big Idea 2: Chemical Reactions**
Chemical reactions involve rearrangement of atoms to form new substances, with conservation of mass and characteristic energy changes.

**Big Idea 3: Earth Chemistry**
The Earth's resources and atmosphere have chemical origins and can be understood through chemical principles.

### 12.3 Cross-Curricular Links

**Mathematics:**
- Ratio and proportion (formulae, equations)
- Data handling and graphing (rates of reaction)
- Algebra (rearranging equations)

**Physics:**
- Energy transfers (exothermic/endothermic)
- Atomic structure (links to nuclear physics)
- Electricity (electrolysis, conductivity)

**Biology:**
- Biochemistry (respiration, photosynthesis)
- Digestion (enzymes, pH)
- Ecology (carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle)
