# Working Scientifically: Skills Progression and Pedagogical Approaches

## Introduction

Working scientifically constitutes the disciplinary heart of science education in England, representing the methods, processes, and skills through which scientific knowledge is constructed and validated. As specified in the National Curriculum for Science (DfE, 2015), working scientifically "should not be taught as a separate strand" but must be embedded within and clearly related to the teaching of substantive science content. This integration ensures that pupils understand science as an active, evidence-based enterprise rather than a static body of facts.

The National Curriculum identifies five distinct types of scientific enquiry that pupils should encounter: observing over time; pattern seeking; identifying, classifying and grouping; comparative and fair testing (controlled investigations); and researching using secondary sources. These enquiry types provide a structured framework for developing scientific thinking from the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) through to Key Stage 5.

Ofsted's Research Review Series: Science (2021) emphasises that effective science education requires pupils to develop both substantive knowledge (the content of science) and disciplinary knowledge (how science works). Working scientifically represents this disciplinary dimension, enabling pupils to "understand the nature, processes and methods of science through different types of science enquiries that help them to answer scientific questions about the world around them."

## The Five Types of Scientific Enquiry

### 1. Observing Over Time

Observing over time involves monitoring how phenomena change and develop across extended periods, from minutes to months. This enquiry type helps pupils understand processes of growth, decay, change, and development in both living and non-living systems. The Primary Science Teaching Trust (PSTT) identifies this as fundamental to understanding natural phenomena that cannot be grasped through single observations.

**Key characteristics:**
- Changes may be rapid (ice melting) or gradual (plant growth, seasonal changes)
- Requires systematic recording at intervals
- Develops understanding of process and causation over time
- Builds patience and longitudinal thinking

**Pedagogical considerations:** Teachers should provide structured observation frameworks, including recording templates, measurement schedules, and opportunities for prediction and explanation. Digital tools such as time-lapse photography can make slow processes visible and engaging.

### 2. Pattern Seeking

Pattern seeking involves identifying relationships and correlations between variables where full experimental control is neither possible nor ethical. Unlike fair testing, pattern seeking acknowledges that in many scientific contexts, particularly in biological and environmental science, variables cannot be fully controlled.

**Key characteristics:**
- Explores relationships between variables without manipulation
- Often involves large data sets and statistical thinking
- Accepts that correlation does not imply causation
- Develops skills in data interpretation and inference

**Examples:** Investigating whether taller people have longer arms; exploring relationships between exercise and heart rate; examining patterns in weather data across geographic regions.

**Critical thinking:** Pattern seeking provides essential opportunities to teach pupils about the limitations of observational data and the difference between correlation and causation—concepts that become increasingly important at Key Stage 3 and beyond.

### 3. Identifying, Classifying and Grouping

This enquiry type involves sorting objects, living things, or phenomena according to their characteristics. Classification is fundamental to biology but applies across all science disciplines, helping pupils organise knowledge and recognise underlying structures.

**Key characteristics:**
- Based on observable and measurable characteristics
- May involve binary (yes/no) or multi-stage classification keys
- Develops logical thinking and decision-making skills
- Builds understanding of hierarchical relationships

**Progression:** At Key Stage 1, pupils use simple criteria for grouping. By Key Stage 2, they encounter more complex classification systems including Linnaean taxonomy. At Key Stage 3 and beyond, classification becomes increasingly sophisticated, incorporating evolutionary relationships and genetic similarities.

### 4. Comparative and Fair Testing (Controlled Investigations)

Fair testing represents the most structured form of scientific enquiry, involving systematic manipulation of variables to establish cause-and-effect relationships. This approach most closely mirrors the "scientific method" as popularly understood.

**Key characteristics:**
- One variable is deliberately changed (independent variable)
- Outcome is measured (dependent variable)
- All other conditions are kept constant (controlled variables)
- Results are compared to a control where possible

**The concept of fairness:** Young pupils often struggle with the abstract concept of a "fair test." Teachers should use concrete examples and explicitly discuss why controlling variables matters. Bishop Gilpin CE Primary School's guidance notes that "fair tests involve making systematic changes and analysing data to identify how one variable influences others."

**Variable types:**
- **Independent variable:** The factor deliberately changed by the investigator
- **Dependent variable:** The factor measured or observed as an outcome
- **Controlled variables:** Factors kept constant to ensure a fair test

### 5. Research Using Secondary Sources

Research skills enable pupils to access and evaluate scientific information from sources beyond their immediate experience. This enquiry type is increasingly important in an information-rich age where critical evaluation of sources is essential.

**Key characteristics:**
- Accesses existing knowledge rather than generating new data
- Requires critical evaluation of source reliability
- Develops information literacy and synthesis skills
- Enables investigation of phenomena beyond the classroom

**Source evaluation:** Pupils should learn to assess the credibility, currency, and bias of sources. This includes distinguishing between peer-reviewed scientific literature, popular science writing, and unreliable sources.

## Progression Across Key Stages

### Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS)

In EYFS, scientific thinking emerges through the "Understanding the World" area of learning. The PSTT's "Play, Observe and Ask" framework emphasises that children aged 3–5 develop science understanding through playful exploration, systematic observation, and curiosity-driven questioning.

**Characteristics of effective practice:**
- Learning through play and first-hand experience
- Adult-supported observation and questioning
- Development of vocabulary for describing properties and changes
- Foundation skills for later scientific enquiry

The EYFS Framework (2021) specifies that children should "explore the natural world around them, making observations and drawing pictures of animals and plants" and "understand some important processes and changes in the natural world."

### Key Stage 1 (Years 1–2)

The Key Stage 1 programme of study explicitly introduces working scientifically skills that pupils should develop through the content areas:

- Asking simple questions and recognising that they can be answered in different ways
- Observing closely, using simple equipment
- Performing simple tests
- Identifying and classifying
- Using observations and ideas to suggest answers to questions
- Gathering and recording data to help in answering questions

The National Curriculum guidance states that "pupils in years 1 and 2 should explore the world around them and raise their own questions." Most learning should occur through first-hand practical experiences, supplemented by appropriate secondary sources.

**Teaching emphasis:** At this stage, the distinction between enquiry types should not be overly emphasised. Pupils benefit from experiencing different approaches without necessarily labelling them. The focus should be on developing curiosity, observational skills, and the foundations of systematic investigation.

### Key Stage 2 (Years 3–6)

Key Stage 2 represents significant development in working scientifically capabilities. Pupils are expected to:

- Plan different types of scientific enquiries to answer questions
- Take measurements with increasing accuracy and precision
- Record data and results using scientific diagrams, labels, and classification keys
- Use test results to make predictions and set up further comparative and fair tests
- Report and present findings from enquiries
- Identify scientific evidence used to support or refute ideas

The curriculum explicitly references all five enquiry types, indicating that pupils should experience and become familiar with each approach. By the end of Key Stage 2, pupils should understand the characteristics that distinguish different enquiry types and select appropriate approaches for different questions.

### Key Stage 3 (Years 7–9)

Working scientifically skills are developed further once pupils "have built up sufficient understanding of science to engage meaningfully in more sophisticated discussion of experimental design and control" (National Curriculum, 2015).

Key Stage 3 introduces more complex concepts:
- Scientific attitudes including objectivity, accuracy, and reproducibility
- Experimental skills and investigations with greater independence
- Analysis and evaluation including measurement uncertainty and error
- Measurement including appropriate use of SI units and prefixes

AQA's Key Stage 3 Science Syllabus emphasises developing competence across these areas to ensure "success at GCSE." The syllabus provides structured progression toward the practical skills required at Key Stage 4.

### Key Stage 4 (GCSE) and Key Stage 5 (A-Level)

At GCSE, working scientifically becomes explicitly assessed through required practical activities and written examinations testing understanding of scientific methodology. Students must demonstrate:

- Development of scientific thinking and experimental design
- Use of scientific vocabulary, quantities, and units
- Presentation of data using appropriate methods and technologies
- Analysis of data including calculation of means, identification of patterns, and drawing conclusions
- Evaluation of data quality, sources of error, and limitations

At A-Level, scientific methodology becomes increasingly sophisticated, with students designing their own investigations, applying statistical tests, and engaging with the philosophy of science including the nature of scientific knowledge, theory, and paradigm shifts.

## Key Concepts in Working Scientifically

### Variables and Fair Testing

Understanding variables is fundamental to experimental design. Teachers should explicitly teach:

- **Independent variable:** The factor intentionally manipulated by the investigator. This is the "cause" in a cause-and-effect relationship.

- **Dependent variable:** The factor measured or observed as a result. This is the "effect" in a cause-and-effect relationship.

- **Controlled variables:** All factors kept constant to ensure that any observed effect is due to the independent variable alone.

The SEERIH (Science and Engineering Education Research and Innovation Hub) at the University of Manchester emphasises that fair testing is only one of five enquiry types and that over-reliance on fair testing can limit pupils' scientific experience. However, when fair testing is appropriate, understanding variables is essential.

### Validity and Reliability

As pupils progress through Key Stage 3 and into Key Stage 4, they encounter more sophisticated concepts:

**Validity** concerns whether the investigation actually measures what it claims to measure. A valid test measures the intended variable without interference from confounding factors.

**Reliability** concerns the consistency and reproducibility of results. Reliable measurements yield similar results when repeated under the same conditions.

**Accuracy** refers to how close a measurement is to the true value. This requires understanding of precision (the smallest unit of measurement) and the limitations of measuring instruments.

### Error and Uncertainty

Advanced working scientifically includes recognition that all measurements involve some degree of uncertainty. Key Stage 4 and 5 students should understand:

- **Random error:** Unpredictable variations in measurement that can be reduced through repeated measurements and averaging
- **Systematic error:** Consistent bias in measurements that cannot be reduced through repetition
- **Anomalous results:** Outliers that should be investigated and may be excluded from analysis with justification

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Embedding Working Scientifically

The National Curriculum specifies that working scientifically "must always be taught through and clearly related to the teaching of substantive science content." Effective approaches include:

**Contextualised enquiry:** Frame investigations within meaningful contexts that connect to pupils' interests and real-world issues. The Ofsted research review found that meaningful contexts enhance engagement and understanding.

**Progressive release of responsibility:** Begin with highly structured investigations in Key Stage 1, gradually increasing pupil autonomy through Key Stage 2 and into secondary phases.

**Explicit teaching of enquiry types:** As pupils mature, explicitly name and discuss different enquiry types, helping pupils develop a metacognitive awareness of scientific methodology.

### Developing Scientific Vocabulary

The National Curriculum emphasises that "pupils should be able to describe associated processes and key characteristics in common language, but they should also be familiar with, and use, technical terminology accurately and precisely."

Effective strategies include:
- Word walls and vocabulary displays
- Explicit teaching of root words, prefixes, and suffixes
- Opportunities to use scientific language in discussion and writing
- Distinguishing between everyday and scientific meanings (e.g., "force" in physics versus everyday usage)

### Assessment of Working Scientifically

Assessment should focus on whether pupils can:
- Select appropriate enquiry types for different questions
- Design fair tests with appropriate controls
- Collect and record data systematically
- Analyse and interpret data to draw valid conclusions
- Evaluate investigations and suggest improvements

Ofsted's subject report "Finding the Optimum" (2023) found that in weaker practice, working scientifically was either taught separately from substantive content or superficially addressed without developing genuine understanding.

## Common Misconceptions

### Conceptual Misconceptions

**Confusing correlation with causation:** Pupils often assume that because two variables are related, one causes the other. Pattern-seeking enquiries provide opportunities to explicitly address this misconception.

**Believing science always follows "the scientific method":** Pupils may develop a rigid, linear view of scientific investigation. Exposing them to the full range of enquiry types demonstrates the diversity of scientific practice.

**Thinking a single experiment "proves" a theory:** Pupils need to understand that scientific knowledge accumulates through multiple investigations, replication, and peer review.

### Practical Misconceptions

**Controlling all variables except one:** Younger pupils struggle with the concept of controlled variables. Concrete examples and explicit discussion help develop this understanding.

**Understanding measurement error:** Pupils often assume measurements are either "right" or "wrong" rather than understanding measurement as approximate with varying degrees of uncertainty.

**Distinguishing between accuracy and precision:** These concepts are often conflated and require explicit teaching with clear examples.

## Implications for Curriculum Planning

### Breadth of Enquiry Types

Curriculum plans should ensure pupils encounter all five enquiry types regularly, not just fair testing. The Ofsted research review identified over-reliance on fair testing as a limitation in some schools, noting that pupils need experience with pattern seeking and research to understand the full range of scientific methodology.

### Progression and Sequencing

Working scientifically skills should be sequenced to build systematically:
- Early years: Observation, exploration, questioning
- Key Stage 1: Simple tests, grouping, recording
- Key Stage 2: Planning enquiries, controlling variables, presenting findings
- Key Stage 3: Independent investigation, analysis, evaluation
- Key Stage 4 and 5: Complex experimental design, statistical analysis, scientific communication

### Integration with Substantive Content

The most effective science teaching integrates working scientifically with the content being learned. Investigations should emerge naturally from the substantive curriculum rather than being bolted on as separate "practicals."

---

## Conclusion

Working scientifically represents the disciplinary knowledge of science education—the understanding of how scientific knowledge is constructed, validated, and communicated. The five types of scientific enquiry provide a structured framework for developing these capabilities from the earliest years through to advanced study.

Effective teaching embeds working scientifically within substantive content, provides explicit instruction in methodology, and ensures pupils encounter the full range of enquiry types. As pupils progress, they develop increasing sophistication in experimental design, data analysis, and critical evaluation, preparing them for further scientific study and informed citizenship in an increasingly scientific and technological world.

The Ofsted research review and subsequent subject report provide clear guidance: working scientifically must be taught well if pupils are to develop genuine scientific literacy. This requires careful curriculum planning, skilled teaching, and ongoing assessment of both substantive and disciplinary knowledge.
