# Atomic Structure and the Periodic Table

## Overview

Atomic structure and the periodic table constitute foundational knowledge in chemistry education, underpinning all subsequent understanding of chemical reactions, bonding, and material properties. The Department for Education's National Curriculum for Science (2014) specifies that pupils must develop understanding of the particulate nature of matter, the structure of atoms, and how elements are arranged in the periodic table. This domain bridges Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4, with concepts introduced at KS3 deepened and extended at GCSE level.

The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Association for Science Education emphasise that atomic structure should not be taught as abstract theory disconnected from observable phenomena. Rather, effective pedagogy connects sub-microscopic explanations to macroscopic observations, helping pupils understand why materials behave as they do. Ofsted's science subject report (2023) highlighted that the strongest curricula sequence this content carefully, building from concrete experiences toward increasingly sophisticated models of atomic structure.

## The National Curriculum Framework

### Key Stage 3 Requirements

The National Curriculum for Science at Key Stage 3 requires pupils to understand:

- A simple (Dalton) atomic model representing atoms as the smallest particles that define elements
- The differences between atoms, elements, and compounds
- Chemical reactions as processes in which new substances are formed
- The periodic table as an arrangement of elements in order of atomic number
- Groups and periods within the periodic table and the broad trends they represent

The statutory programme of study specifies that pupils should "understand that all matter is composed of atoms" and that "atoms are very small and there are vast numbers in even small samples of matter." This quantitative appreciation—understanding the scale of atoms—is often underdeveloped but crucial for genuine understanding.

### Key Stage 4 Requirements

At GCSE, the DfE subject content for chemistry requires more sophisticated understanding:

- The nuclear model of the atom, including protons, neutrons, and electrons
- Relative atomic mass (Ar) and mass number
- Electronic configuration and its relationship to position in the periodic table
- Development of atomic models throughout history
- Isotopes and their applications

The GCSE specifications from AQA, OCR, Edexcel, and Eduqas all require students to describe the structure of the atom in terms of the relative charges and masses of protons, neutrons, and electrons, and to calculate numbers of subatomic particles from atomic number and mass number.

### Progression Across Key Stages

Effective curriculum sequencing recognises that atomic structure is revisited multiple times with increasing sophistication:

**Key Stage 2 (Foundation):** Pupils encounter the idea that matter is made of particles too small to see. They learn that heating and cooling can change states of matter, and that these changes involve particles behaving differently—not changing themselves.

**Key Stage 3 (Introduction):** The term "atom" is formally introduced. Pupils learn that elements consist of only one type of atom, while compounds contain atoms of different elements chemically combined. The periodic table is presented as a classification system.

**Key Stage 4 (Development):** The nuclear model replaces the simple atomic model. Pupils learn about subatomic particles, electronic structure, and how atomic structure determines chemical properties.

**Post-16 (Refinement):** Subshells, orbitals, and quantum mechanical models replace the shell model. Students learn about ionisation energy patterns and the mathematical basis of periodic trends.

Each transition represents a shift to a more powerful explanatory model, and teachers should explicitly address these model changes to avoid pupils trying to reconcile incompatible understandings simultaneously.

## Atomic Models and Their Development

### The Dalton Atomic Model

John Dalton's atomic theory, proposed in the early nineteenth century, remains the entry point for teaching atomic structure at Key Stage 3. Dalton proposed that:

- All matter is made of atoms
- Atoms of the same element are identical
- Atoms cannot be created, destroyed, or subdivided in chemical reactions
- Compounds form when atoms of different elements combine in fixed ratios

This model is sufficient for explaining conservation of mass in chemical reactions and for distinguishing elements from compounds. However, its limitations become apparent when considering isotopes, nuclear processes, or the electrical nature of matter.

### The Thomson "Plum Pudding" Model

J.J. Thomson's discovery of the electron in 1897 necessitated a revised atomic model. Thomson proposed that atoms were uniform spheres of positive charge with negatively charged electrons embedded within them—analogous to plums in a pudding or seeds in a watermelon.

This model is historically significant as the first to incorporate subatomic structure. Teaching this model provides opportunities to discuss how scientific understanding develops through experimentation—Thomson's cathode ray experiments provided evidence that Dalton's indivisible atoms could, in fact, emit smaller particles.

### The Rutherford Nuclear Model

Ernest Rutherford's gold foil experiment (1909), conducted by Geiger and Marsden under his direction, provided dramatic evidence that atoms contain a dense, positively charged nucleus. Key findings included:

- Most alpha particles passed straight through the foil, suggesting atoms are mostly empty space
- Some particles were deflected at large angles, indicating a concentrated positive charge
- A small number bounced back, revealing the nucleus as extremely dense

The nuclear model positions electrons orbiting a tiny, dense nucleus containing protons and (later discovered) neutrons. This model forms the basis of GCSE teaching, though it raises questions about why electrons do not spiral into the nucleus—a question that requires quantum mechanical explanation at A-level.

### The Bohr Model and Electron Shells

Niels Bohr refined the nuclear model by proposing that electrons occupy discrete energy levels or shells at fixed distances from the nucleus. This model explains:

- Why atoms emit characteristic line spectra when excited
- The existence of maximum electron capacities for each shell (2, 8, 8, 18...)
- The organisation of the periodic table into periods corresponding to electron shells

The Bohr model remains the standard for teaching electronic configuration at GCSE, though teachers should acknowledge its limitations—it does not explain why shells have particular capacities, nor does it account for sub-shell structure required at A-level.

## Subatomic Particles

### Properties of Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons

The nuclear model identifies three fundamental subatomic particles:

| Particle | Relative Mass | Relative Charge | Location |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| Proton | 1 | +1 | Nucleus |
| Neutron | 1 | 0 | Nucleus |
| Electron | 1/1836 (negligible) | -1 | Electron shells/orbitals |

Pupils commonly struggle with the scale of these particles. A proton and neutron have approximately equal mass (1 atomic mass unit, or approximately 1.67 × 10⁻²⁷ kg), while an electron is approximately 1/1836th the mass of a proton—effectively negligible when calculating atomic mass. However, electrons occupy the vast majority of an atom's volume, determining its size (approximately 10⁻¹⁰ m diameter, compared to the nucleus at 10⁻¹⁵ m).

### Atomic Number and Mass Number

Atomic number (Z) defines an element and equals the number of protons in the nucleus. It determines the element's position in the periodic table and its chemical identity. In a neutral atom, the atomic number also equals the number of electrons.

Mass number (A) equals the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Since electrons contribute negligible mass, the mass number effectively determines the atom's mass.

The standard notation represents atoms as:

- Protons = atomic number (Z)
- Electrons = protons (in a neutral atom)
- Neutrons = mass number (A) − atomic number (Z)

### Isotopes

Isotopes are atoms of the same element (same atomic number) with different numbers of neutrons (different mass numbers). For example, carbon exists as carbon-12 (6 neutrons), carbon-13 (7 neutrons), and carbon-14 (8 neutrons).

The existence of isotopes demonstrates that atomic mass is an average based on the relative abundance of isotopes. The periodic table shows relative atomic masses (Ar) that are rarely whole numbers for this reason—chlorine's Ar of 35.5 reflects a mixture of approximately 75% chlorine-35 and 25% chlorine-37.

Isotopes have identical chemical properties because chemical behaviour depends on electron configuration, which is determined by proton number alone. However, physical properties such as mass and, in radioactive isotopes, nuclear stability differ.

Applications of isotopes include:
- **Carbon dating:** Using carbon-14's radioactive decay to date organic materials
- **Medical imaging:** Technetium-99m and iodine-131 in diagnostic scans
- **Radiotherapy:** Cobalt-60 and other isotopes in cancer treatment
- **Tracer studies:** Following chemical pathways in biological and environmental systems

### Relative Atomic Mass Calculations

Relative atomic mass (Ar) is calculated as a weighted average of isotopic masses. For example, boron exists as approximately 20% boron-10 and 80% boron-11, giving Ar = 10.8.

This calculation is required at GCSE and provides opportunities to connect atomic structure to quantitative chemistry.

## Electronic Configuration

### The Shell Model

At GCSE, electrons are understood to occupy energy levels or shells surrounding the nucleus. Each shell has a maximum electron capacity:

- First shell: maximum 2 electrons
- Second shell: maximum 8 electrons
- Third shell: maximum 8 electrons (simplified GCSE model; actually 18)
- Fourth shell: maximum 18 electrons (simplified model)

The outermost shell containing electrons is called the valence shell, and its electrons are valence electrons. These valence electrons determine chemical properties and reactivity.

### Writing Electronic Configurations

Electronic configuration is written as a sequence showing electrons in each shell, starting from the nucleus. For example:

- Sodium (atomic number 11): 2,8,1
- Chlorine (atomic number 17): 2,8,7
- Argon (atomic number 18): 2,8,8

At GCSE, students must be able to write electronic configurations for the first 20 elements and explain how electronic configuration relates to position in the periodic table.

### Relationship to the Periodic Table

The periodic table's structure directly reflects electronic configuration:

- **Period number** = number of occupied electron shells
- **Group number** = number of electrons in the outer shell (for Groups 1-7)
- **Group 0/18 (noble gases)** = full outer shell (2 for helium, 8 for others)

This relationship explains periodic trends in reactivity. Elements in the same group have similar chemical properties because they have the same number of valence electrons.

### The Octet Rule

The octet rule states that atoms tend to react in ways that achieve a full outer shell of eight electrons (or two for the first shell). This drives chemical bonding:

- **Ionic bonding:** Metal atoms lose electrons; non-metal atoms gain electrons
- **Covalent bonding:** Atoms share electron pairs to achieve full shells

The octet rule is a useful simplification at GCSE, though teachers should note exceptions (hydrogen, helium, boron, transition metals).

## The Periodic Table

### Historical Development

The periodic table's development exemplifies how scientific knowledge evolves through pattern recognition and prediction.

**Dmitri Mendeleev (1869):** Arranged approximately 60 known elements by increasing relative atomic mass, leaving gaps for undiscovered elements and predicting their properties. Mendeleev famously left gaps for elements such as gallium (eka-aluminium) and germanium (eka-silicon), whose subsequent discovery confirmed his predictions.

**Henry Moseley (1913):** Demonstrated that atomic number (proton number) rather than atomic mass determines elemental properties. Moseley's X-ray spectroscopy provided the theoretical basis for the modern periodic table's organisation.

### Structure of the Modern Periodic Table

The modern periodic table arranges elements in order of increasing atomic number, with elements arranged in periods (rows) and groups (columns):

**Periods:** Horizontal rows corresponding to the principal electron shell being filled. There are seven periods.

**Groups:** Vertical columns containing elements with similar chemical properties due to identical valence electron configurations:

- **Group 1:** Alkali metals – highly reactive metals forming +1 ions
- **Group 2:** Alkaline earth metals – reactive metals forming +2 ions
- **Groups 3-12:** Transition metals – variable oxidation states, coloured compounds
- **Group 17:** Halogens – reactive non-metals forming -1 ions
- **Group 18:** Noble gases – unreactive due to full outer shells

### Periodic Trends

Key trends across periods and down groups include:

**Across a period (left to right):**
- Atomic radius decreases (increasing nuclear charge pulls electrons closer)
- Metallic character decreases, non-metallic character increases

**Down a group:**
- Atomic radius increases (additional electron shells)
- Reactivity of metals increases; reactivity of non-metals decreases

These trends can be explained through atomic structure principles and provide opportunities for prediction and explanation.

### Metals, Non-metals, and Metalloids

The periodic table shows a broad division between metals (left and centre) and non-metals (right), with metalloids (semi-metals) forming a staircase boundary.

**Metals:** Form positive ions, conduct heat and electricity, are malleable and ductile.

**Non-metals:** Form negative ions or share electrons, typically do not conduct (except graphite).

**Metalloids:** Elements with intermediate properties (boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, tellurium) that are semiconductors.

## Common Misconceptions

### Scale and Spacing Misconceptions

Pupils frequently hold incorrect intuitions about atomic scale:

**The "mini-solar system" error:** While the solar system analogy helps visualise electron orbits, it can lead to misconceptions about electron paths. Teachers should emphasise that electron shells represent probability distributions rather than defined trajectories.

**Nucleus-electron proportion:** Many pupils imagine the nucleus and electrons as similar sizes. In reality, the nucleus occupies approximately 1/10,000th of the atomic diameter. Analogies—such as comparing the nucleus to a pea and the atom to a football stadium—help convey this scale.

**Misconception of touching atoms:** Pupils often imagine atoms as touching each other in solids. In fact, atomic diameters are determined by electron cloud repulsion; the vast majority of "solid" matter is empty space.

### Subatomic Particle Misconceptions

**Proton-electron confusion:** Pupils sometimes confuse protons and electrons, particularly regarding locations or charges. The mnemonic "protons are positive" helps, but regular retrieval practice is essential.

**Neutron neutrality misconceptions:** Some pupils assume neutrons have no function because they are uncharged. Emphasising that neutrons stabilise the nucleus and contribute to atomic mass addresses this gap.

### Electronic Structure Misconceptions

**Full shells misconception:** Pupils may believe all atoms seek to completely fill all their electron shells, rather than just the outer shell. This leads to confusion about transition metals having partially filled inner shells.

**Octet rule overgeneralisation:** Pupils may inappropriately apply the octet rule to hydrogen (which needs 2 electrons), helium (already full), or transition metals (which can expand their octets).

**Shell capacity confusion:** The simplified GCSE model (2,8,8...) is sufficient for the first 20 elements, but pupils may apply it rigidly beyond this range.

### Periodic Table Misconceptions

**Mass-based arrangement:** Historical arrangements by atomic mass can cause confusion. Pupils may believe elements are still arranged by mass rather than atomic number. Teaching Mendeleev's original arrangement followed by Moseley's correction clarifies this.

**Group vs. period confusion:** Pupils may confuse horizontal and vertical relationships. Consistent use of language and visual emphasising of group/family similarities helps address this.

**Reactivity trend errors:** Pupils often incorrectly generalise that "reactivity increases down the periodic table" without recognising the difference between metals (reactivity increases down groups) and non-metals (reactivity decreases down groups).

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Concrete to Abstract Progression

Effective teaching of atomic structure follows a concrete-to-abstract progression:

1. **Macroscopic phenomena first:** Begin with observable properties of elements and compounds
2. **Particulate explanations:** Introduce atomic models to explain observations
3. **Symbolic representations:** Develop fluency with chemical symbols, formulae, and equations
4. **Mathematical relationships:** Connect atomic structure to quantitative chemistry

Johnstone's triangle (macroscopic, sub-microscopic, symbolic) provides a framework for ensuring pupils develop understanding across all three representational levels.

### Historical Narrative Approach

Teaching atomic models through their historical development helps pupils understand:

- Science as an evolving body of knowledge rather than fixed facts
- The role of evidence in scientific reasoning
- How new evidence can necessitate model revision
- The provisional nature of scientific understanding

Rutherford's gold foil experiment particularly exemplifies how unexpected results can lead to paradigm shifts. The surprise that most alpha particles passed through while some bounced back challenged existing assumptions and led to the nuclear model.

### Visual and Physical Models

Multiple representations support understanding:

**Physical models:** Ball-and-stick or space-filling models help pupils appreciate molecular geometry, though they risk reinforcing the misconception of atoms as solid spheres.

**Computer simulations:** PhET interactive simulations and similar resources allow pupils to visualise electron shells, explore ion formation, and observe periodic trends dynamically.

**Analogies:** The solar system analogy (with caveats), the stadium analogy for scale, and nesting dolls for electron shells all support understanding while requiring explicit discussion of their limitations.

### Diagnostic Assessment

The Royal Society of Chemistry emphasises the importance of diagnostic assessment for uncovering misconceptions before they become entrenched. Effective diagnostic questions probe:

- Whether pupils understand the relative scale of atoms and their components
- Whether pupils can correctly identify numbers of subatomic particles from atomic and mass numbers
- Whether pupils understand that isotopes have
identical chemical properties
- Whether pupils can explain periodic trends using atomic structure principles

Taber's "Chemical Misconceptions" resources (available through RSC Education) provide diagnostic instruments specifically designed to reveal common alternative conceptions about atomic structure.

## Practical Activities and Demonstrations

### Flame Tests and Emission Spectra

Flame tests demonstrate the connection between electron configuration and observable phenomena. When metal salts are heated, electrons are excited to higher energy levels and emit characteristic colours as they return to lower levels. This provides tangible evidence for:

- The existence of discrete energy levels
- The relationship between electronic structure and element identity
- The particulate nature of matter (ions in the salt solution)

### Electrolysis Demonstrations

Electrolysis of molten salts or aqueous solutions demonstrates that compounds contain charged particles (ions) and that chemical change involves electron transfer. This bridges atomic structure to chemical bonding and redox chemistry.

### The Rutherford Scattering Analogy

The classic analogy using a ball bearing and a feather duster or sheet of paper with scattered "atom" representations helps pupils understand how Rutherford deduced the nuclear model from his results. Computer simulations of the gold foil experiment allow pupils to vary parameters and observe how different atomic models would produce different scattering patterns.

### Building Periodic Tables from Element Cards

Activities where pupils arrange element cards based on properties (before seeing the actual periodic table) replicate Mendeleev's achievement and develop understanding of periodicity. This activity helps pupils recognise:

- That the periodic table reflects observable patterns in element properties
- That gaps in the pattern predict undiscovered elements
- That similar properties recur at regular intervals

## Assessment Strategies

### Formative Assessment Approaches

Effective formative assessment of atomic structure understanding requires probing questions that go beyond recall:

**Low-demand questions:**
- State the relative charges of protons, neutrons, and electrons
- Write the electronic configuration of an element given its atomic number
- Identify an element from its position in the periodic table

**Medium-demand questions:**
- Explain why elements in the same group have similar chemical properties
- Calculate the number of neutrons in an atom given its mass number and atomic number
- Explain why atomic mass is rarely a whole number

**High-demand questions:**
- Explain why the Rutherford experiment led to a new atomic model
- Predict and explain the relative reactivity of elements based on their electronic configuration
- Explain the limitations of different atomic models and why scientists developed increasingly sophisticated models

### Addressing Misconceptions Through Assessment

Assessment items should be designed to reveal common misconceptions:

- Items that present atoms with electrons in the nucleus or protons in shells reveal location confusion
- Items asking pupils to compare the mass of different atoms with the same mass number but different atomic numbers reveal understanding of mass number composition
- Items requiring explanation of why isotopes have identical chemical properties reveal understanding of the relationship between electron configuration and chemical behaviour

### Summative Assessment at GCSE

GCSE examinations assess atomic structure and the periodic table through:

- Recall questions on subatomic particle properties
- Calculations involving atomic number, mass number, and relative atomic mass
- Explanations of periodic trends using atomic structure principles
- Extended writing on the development of atomic models
- Application of knowledge to unfamiliar contexts

The Ofsted science review (2021) noted that assessment is most effective when it requires pupils to make connections between different aspects of atomic structure knowledge rather than testing discrete facts in isolation.

### Cognitive Load Considerations

Atomic structure is inherently abstract, requiring careful management of cognitive load:

- Teach one atomic model at a time, explicitly noting when moving to a more sophisticated model
- Use consistent representations within a lesson to avoid format-switching costs
- Provide worked examples for calculations before independent practice
- Use partially completed examples to reduce the burden of writing while maintaining thinking demand

## Conclusion

Atomic structure and the periodic table form the foundation of chemistry education, providing the explanatory framework for all subsequent chemical understanding. Effective teaching in this domain requires:

- Careful sequencing from concrete observations to abstract models
- Explicit attention to the historical development of atomic theory
- Rigorous attention to common misconceptions through diagnostic assessment
- Multiple representations connecting macroscopic, sub-microscopic, and symbolic levels
- Integration of practical activities that demonstrate the connection between electron configuration and observable phenomena

The investment in developing secure understanding of atomic structure pays dividends throughout pupils' chemistry education, enabling them to explain chemical reactions, predict compound formation, and understand material properties through the lens of atomic and electronic structure.

By attending to the pedagogical principles outlined in this knowledge base—progressive model development, misconception-focused teaching, practical demonstration, and cross-curricular connection—teachers can ensure that pupils develop a robust and transferable understanding of atomic structure and periodicity that serves as a foundation for further study in chemistry and related sciences.
