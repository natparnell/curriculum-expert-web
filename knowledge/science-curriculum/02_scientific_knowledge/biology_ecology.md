# Biology: Ecology and Ecosystems

This knowledge file provides a comprehensive overview of ecology for UK science teachers, covering food chains and food webs, biodiversity, human impact on ecosystems, and sampling techniques. It is designed to support teaching from Key Stage 3 through to GCSE (AQA, Edexcel, OCR), with pedagogical approaches and common misconceptions identified.

## Overview of Ecology

Ecology is the study of how organisms interact with each other and their environment. It encompasses the relationships between living things (biotic factors) and non-living components (abiotic factors) of ecosystems. Understanding ecology is fundamental to appreciating how life functions on Earth and how human activities affect the natural world.

### The Importance of Ecology in the Curriculum

The Department for Education's National Curriculum for Science (2014) requires pupils to understand the interdependence of organisms in an ecosystem, including food webs and insect-pollinated crops. At Key Stage 3, pupils should learn how organisms affect, and are affected by, their environment, and the importance of maintaining biodiversity. At GCSE, examination boards (AQA, Edexcel, OCR) require detailed knowledge of ecosystems, material cycles, biodiversity, and the impact of human activities on the environment.

## Ecosystems and Habitats

An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with each other and their physical environment. Ecosystems can range in size from a small pond to an entire ocean or forest. Every ecosystem comprises two fundamental components: biotic factors (living organisms) and abiotic factors (non-living elements).

### Biotic and Abiotic Factors

Biotic factors are all the living components of an ecosystem, including producers (plants and algae), consumers (animals), and decomposers (bacteria and fungi). These organisms interact through feeding relationships, competition for resources, and symbiotic relationships such as mutualism, parasitism, and commensalism.

Abiotic factors are the non-living components that influence the ecosystem, including light intensity, temperature, moisture levels, pH, soil composition, and availability of water and minerals. The combination of these factors determines which organisms can survive in a particular habitat. Oak National Academy (2023) emphasises that pupils should understand how changes in abiotic factors can affect the distribution and abundance of organisms.

### Habitats and Microhabitats

A habitat is the place where an organism lives. Within larger habitats, smaller-scale environments called microhabitats exist. For example, within a woodland habitat, there are microhabitats including the forest floor, the leaf litter layer, tree bark, and the canopy. Each microhabitat has distinct abiotic conditions and supports different communities of organisms.

### Adaptation to Habitats

Organisms are adapted to live in their specific habitats through structural, behavioural, and physiological adaptations. Structural adaptations include physical features such as the thick fur of Arctic mammals or the streamlined bodies of aquatic animals. Behavioural adaptations include migration, hibernation, and mating displays. Physiological adaptations involve internal body processes, such as the ability of desert animals to concentrate urine to conserve water.

## Feeding Relationships: Food Chains and Food Webs

Feeding relationships within an ecosystem show how energy flows from one organism to another. These relationships are represented visually through food chains and food webs.

### Understanding Food Chains

A food chain shows a single pathway of energy transfer from one organism to another. It begins with a producer—typically a green plant or alga that can photosynthesise to make its own food using energy from sunlight. Producers are eaten by primary consumers (herbivores), which are in turn eaten by secondary consumers (carnivores or omnivores). Tertiary consumers may feed on secondary consumers. At each level, some organisms die and are broken down by decomposers, which recycle nutrients back into the soil.

The arrow in a food chain points in the direction of energy flow, from the organism being eaten to the organism doing the eating. A simple example from a British woodland might be:

Oak leaf → Caterpillar → Blue tit → Sparrowhawk

### Trophic Levels

Each stage in a food chain is called a trophic level. Producers occupy the first trophic level, primary consumers the second, secondary consumers the third, and tertiary consumers the fourth. As energy passes from one trophic level to the next, approximately 90% is lost—primarily as heat through respiration, and also through undigested matter and movement. This means that only about 10% of energy is transferred between trophic levels, which explains why food chains rarely have more than five links and why biomass decreases at higher trophic levels.

### Food Webs

In reality, most organisms eat more than one type of food and are eaten by more than one predator. A food web shows all the interconnected food chains in an ecosystem, providing a more realistic picture of feeding relationships. Food webs demonstrate the complexity of ecosystems and how organisms depend on multiple food sources.

If one organism in a food web is removed or its population declines significantly, this can have ripple effects throughout the ecosystem. For example, if a pesticide reduces the number of insects in a woodland, this affects not only the birds that eat those insects but also the predators that eat those birds. This interconnectedness highlights the importance of maintaining biodiversity for ecosystem stability.

### Predator-Prey Cycles

Populations of predators and prey often show cyclical patterns of increase and decrease. When prey populations are high, predator populations increase because food is abundant. As predator numbers grow, they consume more prey, causing prey populations to decline. With less food available, predator populations then decrease, allowing prey populations to recover. This cycle continues over time. A classic example is the relationship between lynx and snowshoe hares in Canada, documented through historical fur-trapping records.

## Biodiversity

Biodiversity refers to the variety of living organisms in a particular habitat or on Earth as a whole. It encompasses genetic diversity (variation within species), species diversity (the number of different species), and ecosystem diversity (the variety of different habitats and ecological processes).

### Measuring Biodiversity

In school ecology, biodiversity is often measured by counting the number of different species in a habitat—this is called species richness. A more sophisticated measure is the Simpson's Diversity Index, which takes into account both the number of species and how evenly distributed individuals are among those species. A habitat with many species, each represented by similar numbers of individuals, has higher biodiversity than a habitat with the same number of species but where most individuals belong to one dominant species.

### The Importance of Biodiversity

Biodiversity is essential for ecosystem stability and resilience. Diverse ecosystems can better withstand environmental changes and disturbances because if one species is affected, others may continue to perform similar ecological functions. Biodiversity also provides essential ecosystem services that support human life, including pollination of crops, purification of water and air, decomposition of waste, and regulation of climate.

The United Nations (2019) identified the key drivers of biodiversity loss, including overfishing, climate change, and pollution. However, the single biggest driver of biodiversity loss is the destruction of natural habitats through deforestation, urbanisation, and conversion of land to agriculture.

### Biodiversity in the UK Curriculum

At Key Stage 3, pupils should understand that when there is a range of species in a habitat, we refer to this as biodiversity (Oak National Academy, 2023). They should learn that conservation can take place at various scales, from local wildlife corridors to large protected areas. At GCSE, students examine biodiversity in greater depth, including the causes and consequences of biodiversity loss and strategies for conservation.

## Material Cycles in Ecosystems

Materials such as carbon, nitrogen, and water are recycled through ecosystems. Unlike energy, which flows through ecosystems and is eventually lost as heat, matter is continuously cycled between biotic and abiotic components.

### The Carbon Cycle

Carbon is a fundamental building block of life and cycles through the atmosphere, oceans, soil, and living organisms. Plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, converting it into carbohydrates. When plants are eaten by animals, carbon passes up the food chain. Carbon is returned to the atmosphere through respiration by all living organisms, and through combustion when materials burn. Decomposers release carbon as they break down dead organic matter.

Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have disrupted the carbon cycle by releasing stored carbon into the atmosphere faster than natural processes can remove it. This has led to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and global climate change.

### The Nitrogen Cycle

Nitrogen is essential for building proteins and DNA. Although the atmosphere is approximately 78% nitrogen gas, most organisms cannot use nitrogen in this form. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria in soil and in the root nodules of leguminous plants convert atmospheric nitrogen into nitrates that plants can absorb. Other bacteria in the soil convert waste products and dead organisms back into nitrates through processes called ammonification and nitrification. Denitrifying bacteria return nitrogen to the atmosphere, completing the cycle.

### Decomposition

Decomposition is the breakdown of dead organic matter by decomposers, primarily bacteria and fungi. This process releases nutrients back into the soil, making them available for plants to absorb. The rate of decomposition depends on several factors: temperature (decomposition is faster in warm conditions), moisture (decomposers need water), and oxygen availability (most decomposers are aerobic). Understanding decomposition helps pupils appreciate how nutrients are recycled in ecosystems.

## Human Impact on Ecosystems

Human activities have profound effects on ecosystems, both locally and globally. Understanding these impacts and developing strategies to mitigate them is a crucial aspect of ecology education.

### Habitat Destruction and Fragmentation

The destruction of natural habitats is the primary cause of biodiversity loss worldwide. Activities such as deforestation, draining of wetlands, urban development, and conversion of wild areas to agricultural land eliminate the places where species live. Even when habitats are not completely destroyed, fragmentation—breaking large habitats into smaller, isolated patches—can isolate populations and reduce genetic diversity.

### Pollution

Pollution affects ecosystems in numerous ways. Air pollution from burning fossil fuels causes acid rain, which damages forests and acidifies lakes. Water pollution from agricultural runoff (fertilisers and pesticides) and industrial discharge contaminates rivers and oceans, causing eutrophication and harming aquatic life. Light pollution disrupts the behaviour of nocturnal animals, while plastic pollution affects marine ecosystems globally.

### Climate Change

Climate change, driven by greenhouse gas emissions, is altering ecosystems worldwide. As temperatures rise, species are shifting their ranges toward the poles or to higher altitudes. Some species cannot adapt or move quickly enough and face extinction. Changes in seasonal patterns affect the timing of migration, breeding, and flowering, disrupting established ecological relationships. Ocean acidification, caused by absorption of carbon dioxide, threatens marine ecosystems particularly coral reefs and shell-forming organisms.

### Overexploitation

Overfishing, overhunting, and unsustainable harvesting of wild plants and animals can drive species to extinction and disrupt ecosystem balance. The UN report (2019) identified overfishing as one of the key drivers of biodiversity loss. Sustainable management practices, including quotas, protected areas, and seasonal restrictions, are necessary to prevent overexploitation.

### Conservation Strategies

Conservation involves protecting and managing ecosystems to maintain biodiversity. Strategies include establishing protected areas such as national parks and nature reserves, creating wildlife corridors to connect fragmented habitats, captive breeding programmes for endangered species, and sustainable use policies that balance human needs with ecosystem health. At the local level, schools can contribute to conservation through wildlife gardens, habitat restoration projects, and reducing their ecological footprint.

## Sampling Techniques in Ecology

Ecologists use various sampling techniques to investigate the distribution and abundance of organisms in ecosystems. These techniques are essential for fieldwork and provide quantitative data that can be analysed statistically.

### Random Sampling with Quadrats

A quadrat is a square frame, typically 0.5m × 0.5m or 1m × 1m, used to define a sample area. Random sampling involves placing quadrats at random positions within the study area, often using random number coordinates. This ensures the sample is unbiased and representative of the whole area.

Within each quadrat, researchers can record percentage cover (the percentage of the quadrat area covered by each species), frequency (the number of quadrats in which a species occurs), or count the number of individuals of each species. Percentage cover is particularly useful for plants that grow close together and are difficult to count individually.

### Systematic Sampling with Transects

Systematic sampling uses a line called a transect, along which samples are taken at regular intervals. A tape measure is laid across the habitat, and quadrats are placed at regular distances (e.g., every 5 metres) along this line. This method is useful for investigating changes in species distribution along an environmental gradient, such as from the top to the bottom of a rocky shore, or from a path into a woodland.

A belt transect involves placing quadrats continuously or at closely spaced intervals along the transect line, providing more detailed information about species distribution than a simple line transect.

### Sampling Animals

Different techniques are required for sampling mobile animals:

**Pitfall traps** are containers buried in the ground with their rims level with the surface. Small invertebrates walking on the ground fall into the trap and can be collected for identification. Pitfall traps are useful for sampling ground-dwelling insects, spiders, and other small animals.

**Pooters** are small devices used to suck up small animals such as insects. One tube goes to the mouth (often with a filter to prevent inhaling the animal), and another tube is placed near the specimen. When the user sucks, the insect is drawn into the collecting chamber.

**Sweep nets** are used to sample insects in vegetation. The net is swept through long grass or bushes, and insects are caught in the net bag.

**Tullgren funnels** are used to extract small invertebrates from leaf litter or soil. A light and heat source above the sample drives animals downward into a collecting jar below.

### Calculating Population Size

For mobile animals, the mark-release-recapture method can estimate population size. A sample of animals is caught, marked harmlessly (e.g., with a dot of paint), and released. Later, another sample is caught, and the proportion of marked animals in this second sample is used to estimate the total population using the Lincoln Index formula: Population = (number marked × total in second sample) ÷ number of marked individuals recaptured.

This method assumes that the marked animals mix randomly with the unmarked population, that marks are not lost or overlooked, and that the population is closed (no births, deaths, or migration between samples).

### Ensuring Valid and Reliable Results

To ensure valid results, samples should be large enough to be representative, and replication is essential. Using multiple quadrats or transects and calculating means allows researchers to identify genuine patterns rather than anomalies. Controlling variables and using standardised methods ensures that comparisons between different areas or times are fair.

## Teaching Ecology: Pedagogical Approaches

Teaching ecology effectively requires balancing theoretical knowledge with practical experience. The following approaches support pupil understanding:

### Practical Fieldwork

Fieldwork is essential for developing ecological understanding. The Department for Education expects schools to provide opportunities for pupils to engage with the natural environment. Even simple investigations in the school grounds—such as comparing biodiversity in mown and unmown grass, or studying distribution of organisms along a transect from a path—can provide valuable learning experiences.

Before conducting fieldwork, pupils should understand the sampling techniques they will use and why these methods are appropriate. During fieldwork, they should collect data systematically and record it accurately. Afterward, they should analyse their data, draw conclusions, and evaluate the reliability and validity of their findings.

### Using Real Data

Using data from real scientific studies, such as the British Ecological Society's research or the RSPB's annual Big Garden Birdwatch, helps pupils see the relevance of ecology to current issues. Discussing case studies of conservation success and failure makes abstract concepts concrete.

### Addressing Common Misconceptions

Several common misconceptions arise when teaching ecology:

- **Food chain arrows:** Pupils often draw arrows pointing from predator to prey, misunderstanding that arrows show energy flow direction. Emphasise that the arrow points to where the energy goes (the eater).

- **Decomposers:** Some pupils think decomposers are "bad" or separate from food webs. Clarify that decomposition is a natural and essential process that recycles nutrients.

- **Food webs:** Pupils may think of food webs as static rather than dynamic. Use examples to show how populations fluctuate and how removing one species affects others.

- **Human impact:** Pupils may have simplistic views about human impacts, seeing humans as separate from nature rather than part of ecosystems. Discuss how human wellbeing depends on healthy ecosystems.

- **Biodiversity:** Pupils often confuse biodiversity with simply having lots of animals. Clarify that it encompasses genetic, species, and ecosystem diversity.

### Cross-Curricular Links

Ecology connects to geography (climate, land use, sustainability), mathematics (data analysis, graphing, statistical tests), and citizenship (environmental ethics, sustainable development). Making these links explicit helps pupils integrate their learning and see ecology as relevant across their education.

## Assessment and Examination

At GCSE, ecology is assessed through written examinations that test both knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts. AQA's Topic 7 (Ecology) and equivalent topics in other specifications typically account for approximately 10% of the biology assessment.

Examination questions may require pupils to:
- Interpret food chains and food webs
- Calculate energy transfer between trophic levels
- Explain the importance of biodiversity
- Evaluate human impacts on ecosystems
- Suggest and justify sampling methods for given scenarios
- Analyse data from ecological investigations
- Discuss conservation strategies and their effectiveness

Practical skills are assessed through required practical activities, which include using quadrats and transects to investigate ecosystems. Pupils must demonstrate competence in fieldwork techniques and understanding of how to ensure valid and reliable results.

## Summary

Ecology is a fundamental area of biology that helps pupils understand how life functions on Earth and their role in the natural world. Effective teaching of ecology combines clear explanation of concepts—ecosystems, food chains and webs, biodiversity, material cycles, and human impacts—with practical fieldwork experience. By mastering sampling techniques and understanding the factors that affect distribution and abundance of organisms, pupils develop scientific skills while gaining appreciation for the importance of conserving the natural world for future generations.
