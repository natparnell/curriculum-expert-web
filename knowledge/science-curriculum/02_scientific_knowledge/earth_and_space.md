# Earth and Space: Curriculum Knowledge Base

## Overview

Earth and space science encompasses the study of our planet's structure, the dynamic systems that shape its surface and atmosphere, and Earth's place within the wider solar system and universe. In the English national curriculum, this domain spans statutory content across key stages 1–4, with specific requirements for rocks and fossils in Year 3, Earth and space in Year 5, and increasingly sophisticated treatment of Earth's systems at key stage 3 and beyond.

Ofsted's Research Review Series: Science (2021) emphasises that science education should enable pupils to "develop a sense of excitement and curiosity about natural phenomena" whilst building secure foundational knowledge. Earth and space topics offer exceptional opportunities for both, though inspectors note that practical activities must be carefully designed to develop conceptual understanding rather than merely providing "fun activities" without deep learning.

## Solar System and Celestial Bodies

### Statutory Requirements

The national curriculum for Year 5 (upper key stage 2) includes specific statutory requirements for Earth and space:

**Pupils should be taught to:**
- Describe the movement of the Earth, and other planets, relative to the Sun in the solar system
- Describe the movement of the Moon relative to the Earth
- Describe the Sun, Earth and Moon as approximately spherical bodies
- Use the idea of the Earth's rotation to explain day and night and the apparent movement of the Sun across the sky

### Content Knowledge: The Solar System

**The Sun as a Star**
The Sun is a star at the centre of our solar system, providing the light and heat that sustain life on Earth. It accounts for approximately 99.86% of the solar system's total mass. Unlike planets, the Sun generates its own light through nuclear fusion reactions in its core, where hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium, releasing enormous quantities of energy.

**The Eight Planets**
The solar system contains eight planets, in order from the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Pluto was reclassified as a "dwarf planet" by the International Astronomical Union in 2006—a development pupils should understand as an example of how scientific knowledge changes with new evidence.

Planets divide into two categories:
- **Terrestrial planets** (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars): Rocky bodies with solid surfaces, relatively small and dense
- **Gas giants** (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune): Large planets composed primarily of hydrogen, helium and other gases, with no solid surface

**Moons and Other Objects**
Moons are celestial bodies that orbit planets. Earth has one moon; Jupiter has four large moons (the Galilean moons discovered by Galileo in 1610) and numerous smaller ones. Beyond planets and moons, the solar system contains dwarf planets (including Pluto, Ceres and Eris), asteroids orbiting between Mars and Jupiter, and comets with elliptical orbits that bring them close to the Sun.

### Historical Models of the Solar System

The national curriculum's non-statutory guidance notes that pupils should "find out about the way that ideas about the solar system have developed." This historical dimension is pedagogically valuable because it illustrates the nature of scientific knowledge—how evidence accumulates, how models are revised, and how scientific consensus shifts.

**The Geocentric Model**
Ancient astronomers, including Ptolemy (c. 100–170 CE), developed geocentric models placing Earth at the centre of the universe. This model aligned with everyday observation—the Sun appears to move across the sky, and we do not feel the Earth moving. However, geocentrism required increasingly complex explanations for observed planetary motions, including retrograde motion where planets appear to move backwards in the sky.

**The Heliocentric Revolution**
Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543) proposed a heliocentric model with the Sun at the centre. While not the first to suggest this (Aristarchus of Samos proposed a heliocentric model in antiquity), Copernicus developed a mathematically coherent system. His work was elaborated by:
- **Galileo Galilei** (1564–1642), whose telescopic observations—including the phases of Venus and Jupiter's moons—provided empirical evidence supporting heliocentrism
- **Johannes Kepler** (1571–1630), who formulated laws of planetary motion showing planets move in elliptical rather than circular orbits
- **Isaac Newton** (1643–1727), whose laws of motion and universal gravitation explained why planets orbit the Sun

The 11th-century scientist Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) made significant contributions to optics and the scientific method that underpinned later astronomical developments.

### Earth's Rotation and Orbit

The Earth's rotation on its axis—completing one full rotation approximately every 24 hours—explains the cycle of day and night. This rotation occurs anticlockwise when viewed from above the North Pole.

The Earth's orbit around the Sun—taking approximately 365.25 days—combined with the tilt of Earth's axis (approximately 23.5 degrees), explains the seasons. When the Northern Hemisphere tilts toward the Sun, it receives more direct sunlight and experiences summer; when tilted away, it receives less direct sunlight and experiences winter.

### Common Misconceptions

Research by the Primary Science Teaching Trust and others identifies persistent misconceptions about Earth and space:

**Shape of Earth, Sun and Moon**
Many young children believe the Earth is flat, or that it is "round like a pancake" rather than spherical. Even after instruction, some pupils maintain that people live "on top" of a spherical Earth, with a distinct "bottom" where people would fall off. The Sun and Moon are often believed to be different shapes or sizes than they actually are.

**Day and Night**
A common misconception is that day and night result from the Sun moving around the Earth (consistent with appearances but scientifically incorrect). Some pupils believe night occurs when the Moon blocks the Sun (a lunar eclipse), or that clouds cover the Sun at night.

**Seasons**
The belief that seasons result from the Earth's changing distance from the Sun is widespread but incorrect—Earth is actually slightly closer to the Sun in January (perihelion) than in July (aphelion). Seasons result from the axial tilt changing the angle and intensity of solar radiation.

**Gravity in Space**
Pupils often believe there is no gravity in space, or that astronauts float because there is no air. In fact, gravity acts throughout the universe; astronauts in orbit are in continuous freefall around Earth.

**Relative Sizes and Distances**
Pupils typically underestimate the scale of the solar system, believing planets are much closer together than they are. Scale models are essential for developing accurate mental models—if Earth were represented by a marble, Neptune would be hundreds of metres away.

## Rocks, Fossils and Soils

### Statutory Requirements

**Year 3 Programme of Study**
- Compare and group together different kinds of rocks on the basis of their appearance and simple physical properties
- Describe in simple terms how fossils are formed when things that have lived are trapped within rock
- Recognise that soils are made from rocks and organic matter

### Content Knowledge: Rock Types

**Igneous Rocks**
Igneous rocks form when magma (molten rock beneath Earth's surface) or lava (molten rock erupted at the surface) cools and solidifies. The rate of cooling determines crystal size:
- Slow cooling (beneath Earth's surface) produces large crystals (e.g., granite)
- Rapid cooling (at or near the surface) produces small crystals or glassy textures (e.g., basalt, obsidian)

Igneous rocks are classified by their mineral composition and texture. Common examples include granite, basalt, pumice and obsidian.

**Sedimentary Rocks**
Sedimentary rocks form through the accumulation and compaction of sediments—particles of rock, mineral or organic material. Key processes include:
- **Weathering and erosion**: Breaking down existing rocks
- **Transportation**: Moving sediments by water, wind or ice
- **Deposition**: Sediments settling in layers
- **Compaction and cementation**: Layers squeezed together and bound by minerals dissolved in water

Sedimentary rocks often contain fossils because the conditions of formation can preserve remains of living things. They typically form in horizontal layers (strata), with older layers beneath younger ones—a principle known as superposition. Examples include limestone, sandstone, shale and chalk.

**Metamorphic Rocks**
Metamorphic rocks form when existing rocks are subjected to heat and/or pressure without melting completely, causing physical and/or chemical changes. Metamorphism can occur:
- Through contact with hot magma (contact metamorphism)
- Through regional tectonic forces (regional metamorphism)

Examples include marble (from limestone), slate (from shale), and gneiss (from granite).

### Content Knowledge: Fossils

Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of animals, plants and other organisms from the past. The process of fossilisation typically requires:
1. Rapid burial to protect from scavengers and decay
2. Absence of oxygen to slow decomposition
3. Presence of hard parts (bones, shells) that resist decay
4. Replacement of original material by minerals, or preservation in amber, tar or ice

**Types of Fossils**
- **Body fossils**: Preserved remains of body parts (bones, teeth, shells)
- **Trace fossils**: Evidence of activity (footprints, burrows, coprolites)
- **Moulds and casts**: Impressions or filled-in impressions of organisms
- **Carbon films**: Thin carbon residue from plants and soft-bodied animals

Fossils provide evidence about the history of life on Earth, showing:
- Life forms that existed in the past but are now extinct
- How living things have changed over time (evolution)
- Past environments and climates
- The relative ages of rock layers

### Content Knowledge: Soils

Soil is a mixture of rock particles (derived from weathered bedrock), organic matter (decaying plant and animal material), water, air and living organisms. The composition varies depending on:
- **Parent material**: The type of rock from which soil forms
- **Climate**: Temperature and rainfall affect weathering rates
- **Topography**: Slope affects drainage and erosion
- **Biological activity**: Plants, animals and microorganisms contribute organic matter
- **Time**: Soil formation is a slow process taking hundreds to thousands of years

Soil structure includes different particle sizes:
- Sand (largest particles)
- Silt (medium particles)
- Clay (smallest particles)

The relative proportions determine soil texture and properties such as drainage, fertility and workability.

### The Rock Cycle

The rock cycle describes how rocks transform between the three types through geological processes:
- Igneous rocks can weather and erode to become sediments, forming sedimentary rocks
- Any rock type subjected to heat and pressure can become metamorphic rock
- Any rock type melted and cooled becomes igneous rock
- Uplift and erosion can expose any rock type at the surface

This cyclical understanding is crucial for grasping Earth's dynamic nature and deep time.

### Common Misconceptions

**Rocks and Stones**
Pupils may use "rock" and "stone" interchangeably, or believe that stones are smaller than rocks. The distinction is not size-based but relates to origin—stones are typically pieces of rock that have been moved from their original location.

**Fossil Formation**
Many pupils believe all fossils are dinosaurs, or that fossils form through bones "turning into stone." The role of sedimentary processes and mineral replacement is often misunderstood.

**Soil Composition**
A significant misconception identified by Explorify and others is that soil is merely "dirt" or "brown stuff on the ground." Pupils often fail to recognise soil as a complex mixture containing rock particles, organic matter, water, air and living things. They may also believe soil is simply "dead rock" rather than appreciating its biological component.

**Rock Classification**
Pupils sometimes classify rocks by colour alone, failing to recognise that rocks of the same type can have different colours and rocks of different types can share colours. Texture and formation processes are more reliable classification criteria.

## Earth's Structure

### Content Knowledge: Interior Structure

Earth has a layered structure resulting from differentiation—denser materials sinking toward the centre during Earth's formation approximately 4.6 billion years ago.

**The Crust**
Earth's outermost layer, relatively thin (5–70 km thick), composed of solid rock. The crust divides into:
- **Continental crust**: Thicker (30–70 km), less dense, composed primarily of granite-like rocks
- **Oceanic crust**: Thinner (5–10 km), denser, composed primarily of basalt

**The Mantle**
The thickest layer (approximately 2,900 km), composed of silicate rocks rich in iron and magnesium. Temperature and pressure increase with depth, causing the mantle to behave as a viscous solid that can flow very slowly (plastic behaviour). Convection currents in the mantle drive plate tectonics.

**The Core**
Divided into:
- **Outer core**: Liquid layer (2,200 km thick), composed mainly of iron and nickel, generating Earth's magnetic field through its motion
- **Inner core**: Solid sphere (radius ~1,220 km), composed mainly of iron and nickel, under such extreme pressure that it remains solid despite high temperatures

Direct evidence for Earth's interior comes from seismic waves generated by earthquakes, which behave differently depending on the materials they pass through.

### Plate Tectonics

The theory of plate tectonics, developed in the 1960s, explains how Earth's surface changes over geological time:

**Lithospheric Plates**
Earth's rigid outer layer (lithosphere) is broken into tectonic plates that move over the asthenosphere (the more plastic upper mantle). Major plates include the North American, South American, Eurasian, African, Indo-Australian, Pacific and Antarctic plates.

**Plate Boundaries**
- **Divergent boundaries**: Plates move apart, allowing magma to rise and create new crust (e.g., mid-ocean ridges, East African Rift)
- **Convergent boundaries**: Plates collide, causing subduction (one plate diving beneath another), mountain building or volcanic activity
- **Transform boundaries**: Plates slide past each other horizontally (e.g., San Andreas Fault)

**Evidence for Plate Tectonics**
- Continental fit (South America and Africa)
- Matching fossils and rock formations across oceans
- Distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes along plate boundaries
- Seafloor spreading and magnetic striping
- GPS measurements showing plate movements

### Progression Across Key Stages

**Key Stage 1–2**
Pupils develop foundational concepts through direct experience and observation:
- KS1: Simple observation of natural materials including rocks
- Year 3: Rock types, fossils, soil composition
- Year 5: Earth in space, planetary motion

**Key Stage 3**
The programme of study expands to include:
- The composition of the Earth
- The structure of the Earth
- The rock cycle and the formation of igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks
- Plate tectonics and the formation of features such as mountains, volcanoes and earthquakes
- The carbon cycle
- The composition of the atmosphere
- Global climate change

**Key Stage 4 (GCSE)**
At GCSE, students study:
- Evidence for the internal structure of the Earth
- The role of convection currents in plate movement
- Specific examples of geological events and their effects
- The evolution of the atmosphere over geological time
- Evidence for climate change and its causes

## Weather, Climate and the Atmosphere

### Content Knowledge: Earth's Atmosphere

The atmosphere is a layer of gases surrounding Earth, held in place by gravity. Its composition has changed significantly over Earth's 4.6-billion-year history:

**Modern Atmospheric Composition**
- Nitrogen (~78%)
- Oxygen (~21%)
- Argon (~0.9%)
- Carbon dioxide (~0.04%, but rising)
- Trace gases including water vapour, methane, ozone

**Evolution of the Atmosphere**
The current oxygen-rich atmosphere developed gradually:
- Early atmosphere (4.6–4.0 billion years ago): Likely mainly carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water vapour, with little oxygen
- Rise of oxygen (2.4 billion years ago): Cyanobacteria evolved photosynthesis, releasing oxygen in the "Great Oxidation Event"
- Modern balance: Plants and algae continue photosynthesis; animals and decomposers consume oxygen; volcanic activity and human activities add carbon dioxide

### Weather and Climate

**Weather** refers to short-term atmospheric conditions (temperature, precipitation, wind, humidity) in a specific place at a specific time. **Climate** refers to long-term patterns of weather in a region, typically averaged over 30 years or more.

**Factors Affecting Climate**
- Latitude (distance from equator)
- Altitude (height above sea level)
- Distance from the sea
- Ocean currents
- Prevailing winds

**The Water Cycle**
The continuous movement of water between Earth's surface and atmosphere involves:
- **Evaporation**: Liquid water becomes water vapour
- **Transpiration**: Water vapour released by plants
- **Condensation**: Water vapour becomes liquid (forming clouds)
- **Precipitation**: Water falls as rain, snow, sleet or hail
- **Collection**: Water accumulates in oceans, lakes, rivers and groundwater

### Climate Change

The national curriculum requires pupils at key stage 3 to understand:
- The composition of the atmosphere
- The carbon cycle
- Global warming and climate change

**The Greenhouse Effect**
Greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, water vapour) trap heat in Earth's atmosphere by absorbing infrared radiation emitted by Earth's surface. This natural greenhouse effect maintains Earth's temperature at a level suitable for life. Enhanced greenhouse effect from increased greenhouse gas concentrations causes global warming.

**Evidence for Climate Change**
- Rising global average temperatures
- Melting ice caps and glaciers
- Rising sea levels
- Changes in precipitation patterns
- Increased frequency of extreme weather events

**Human Activities and Climate**
Human activities, particularly burning fossil fuels and deforestation, have
