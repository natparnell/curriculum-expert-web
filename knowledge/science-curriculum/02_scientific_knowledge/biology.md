# Biology Knowledge Base

## Overview

Biology is the scientific study of living organisms and life processes. Within the UK National Curriculum, biology encompasses the study of cells, organisms, ecosystems, genetics, and evolution. Ofsted's Research Review Series: Science (2021) emphasises that high-quality biology curricula carefully sequence content to reveal the interplay between substantive knowledge (the 'what' of biology) and disciplinary knowledge (working scientifically).

The biology curriculum is organised to develop pupils' understanding progressively across key stages, beginning with observation of living things in the early years, moving through increasingly sophisticated concepts of structure and function, and culminating in abstract genetic and evolutionary principles at GCSE level.

## Cell Biology

### The Cell as the Basic Unit of Life

The concept that all living organisms are composed of cells represents one of the foundational pillars of biological understanding. The National Curriculum introduces this concept gradually, with explicit cell study commencing in Key Stage 3 and deepening through GCSE.

#### Key Stage 3 Foundations

At Key Stage 3, pupils are expected to understand that:

- Cells are the fundamental unit of all living organisms
- Cells share common structures including the nucleus, cytoplasm, and cell membrane
- Some cells are specialised to carry out specific functions

The DfE programmes of study (2013) specify that pupils should learn about the structure of animal and plant cells, including the function of the nucleus as the control centre containing genetic material, the cytoplasm where chemical reactions occur, and the cell membrane that controls what enters and exits the cell.

Plant cells contain additional structures that pupils must understand:

- **Cell wall**: Provides structural support and protection, composed of cellulose
- **Permanent vacuole**: Contains cell sap and helps maintain turgor pressure
- **Chloroplasts**: Contain chlorophyll and are the site of photosynthesis

#### GCSE Depth: Cell Structure and Function

GCSE Biology specifications (AQA, Edexcel, OCR) require substantially deeper understanding:

**Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Cells**

Students must distinguish between eukaryotic cells (animals, plants, fungi, protists) and prokaryotic cells (bacteria). Eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound organelles including a nucleus, while prokaryotic cells lack these structures. Bacterial cells possess:

- A cell membrane surrounded by a cell wall
- Cytoplasm containing ribosomes
- Genetic material as a single DNA loop not enclosed in a nucleus
- Plasmids (small rings of DNA that can be transferred between bacteria)

**Cell Specialisation**

GCSE students study how cells differentiate to become specialised for specific functions:

- **Nerve cells**: Long axons for rapid impulse transmission, branched dendrites for connections
- **Muscle cells**: Contain proteins that contract, multiple mitochondria for energy
- **Sperm cells**: Streamlined shape with flagellum for movement, acrosome containing enzymes
- **Root hair cells**: Large surface area for water absorption, no chloroplasts
- **Xylem cells**: Hollow tubes with lignin for water transport and structural support

**Cell Division**

The cell cycle and mitosis represent critical GCSE content. Students must understand:

- Chromosomes carry genetic information in the form of genes
- The cell cycle includes cell growth, DNA replication, and cell division
- Mitosis produces two identical daughter cells for growth and repair
- The stages of mitosis: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase

**Stem Cells**

Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that can develop into different cell types. The curriculum covers:

- **Embryonic stem cells**: Found in early embryos, can differentiate into any cell type
- **Adult stem cells**: Found in tissues like bone marrow, can differentiate into limited cell types
- Therapeutic applications and ethical considerations

### Microscopy and Cell Measurement

Working scientifically skills in cell biology include microscopy techniques. GCSE specifications require students to:

- Calculate magnification: magnification = image size ÷ actual size
- Understand units from metres to nanometres
- Make order of magnitude calculations
- Use microscopes to observe prepared and living cells

---

## Organisation: From Cells to Organisms

### Levels of Organisation

The National Curriculum structures understanding of biological organisation hierarchically:

```
Cells → Tissues → Organs → Organ Systems → Organisms
```

#### Key Stage 3 Organisation

Pupils learn that cells are organised into tissues, tissues into organs, and organs into organ systems. The DfE specifies coverage of:

- The hierarchical organisation of multicellular organisms
- The human digestive system
- The human circulatory system
- The human respiratory system

#### Tissues and Organs

**Plant Tissues and Organs**

Students study plant tissues including:

- **Epidermal tissue**: Covers and protects the plant
- **Palisade mesophyll**: Contains chloroplasts for photosynthesis
- **Spongy mesophyll**: Gas exchange with air spaces
- **Xylem and phloem**: Transport tissues

Plant organs include roots (absorption and anchorage), stems (support and transport), and leaves (photosynthesis).

**Animal Tissues and Organs**

GCSE specifications cover:

- **Epithelial tissue**: Covers surfaces and lines cavities
- **Muscular tissue**: Contracts to bring about movement
- **Connective tissue**: Supports and binds other tissues
- **Nervous tissue**: Coordinates responses through electrical impulses

### The Digestive System

The digestive system exemplifies how organs work together as a system. GCSE content includes:

- **Mouth**: Mechanical digestion (teeth), chemical digestion (salivary amylase)
- **Oesophagus**: Peristalsis moves food to the stomach
- **Stomach**: Protease enzymes begin protein digestion, hydrochloric acid kills bacteria
- **Small intestine**: Enzymes complete digestion, villi absorb nutrients
- **Large intestine**: Water absorption, formation of faeces
- **Liver**: Produces bile for fat emulsification
- **Pancreas**: Produces digestive enzymes and insulin

### The Circulatory System

The circulatory system transports substances around the body. Key components include:

**The Heart**

- Four chambers: right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, left ventricle
- Valves prevent backflow of blood
- The cardiac cycle: atrial systole, ventricular systole, diastole
- Double circulation: pulmonary (heart to lungs) and systemic (heart to body)

**Blood Vessels**

- **Arteries**: Thick muscular walls, carry blood away from heart under high pressure
- **Veins**: Thinner walls with valves, carry blood to heart under low pressure
- **Capillaries**: One-cell thick walls for exchange with tissues

**Blood Components**

- **Red blood cells**: Contain haemoglobin for oxygen transport, no nucleus
- **White blood cells**: Phagocytes and lymphocytes for immune defence
- **Platelets**: Cell fragments involved in clotting
- **Plasma**: Liquid medium transporting nutrients, hormones, waste, and carbon dioxide

### The Respiratory System

Gas exchange occurs in the respiratory system:

- **Trachea**: Supported by cartilage rings, lined with cilia and mucus
- **Bronchi and bronchioles**: Branching airways leading to alveoli
- **Alveoli**: Site of gas exchange, adaptations include large surface area, thin walls, good blood supply, moist lining

---

## Ecosystems and Interdependence

### Habitats and Ecosystems

#### Key Stage 1 and 2 Foundations

Primary science introduces ecosystems through direct experience:

- Identifying and naming plants and animals in local habitats
- Understanding that habitats provide food, water, shelter, and space
- Recognising that different plants and animals live in different habitats
- Simple food chains showing feeding relationships

The National Curriculum for Key Stage 2 specifies that pupils should:

- Describe how living things are classified into broad groups based on observable characteristics
- Construct and interpret food chains
- Recognise that environments can change and this can pose dangers to living things

#### Key Stage 3 and GCSE Depth

**Ecosystem Structure**

GCSE students study ecosystems as biological communities interacting with their physical environment:

- **Producers**: Plants and algae that photosynthesise to produce food
- **Consumers**: Animals that obtain energy by eating other organisms
- **Decomposers**: Bacteria and fungi that break down dead material

**Trophic Levels and Energy Transfer**

- Energy flows through ecosystems in food chains and food webs
- Energy is lost at each trophic level through respiration, heat, waste, and uneaten parts
- Energy transfer efficiency is typically around 10% between levels
- Pyramids of biomass, numbers, and energy represent trophic relationships

**Nutrient Cycles**

The carbon cycle represents a critical GCSE topic:

- Carbon dioxide removed from atmosphere by photosynthesis
- Carbon passed through food chains
- Carbon returned to atmosphere through respiration, combustion, and decomposition
- The importance of carbon sinks including forests and oceans

### Biodiversity and Ecosystem Stability

**Biodiversity Measures**

Students learn to measure biodiversity:

- Species richness: the number of different species
- Species evenness: the relative abundance of each species
- Methods include quadrats for plants and pitfall traps for invertebrates

**Human Impacts on Ecosystems**

The curriculum addresses human influences:

- **Deforestation**: Habitat loss, carbon release, soil erosion
- **Pollution**: Air, water, and land pollution effects on wildlife
- **Climate change**: Altered habitats, shifted species ranges, ocean acidification
- **Overfishing**: Depleted fish stocks and ecosystem collapse

**Conservation Strategies**

GCSE specifications cover conservation approaches:

- Protection of habitats through legislation and reserves
- Breeding programmes for endangered species
- Sustainable resource management
- Recycling and waste reduction

### Interdependence and Competition

Living organisms compete for limited resources:

- **Intraspecific competition**: Between members of the same species
- **Interspecific competition**: Between different species

The concept of adaptation is developed:

- **Structural adaptations**: Physical features (camel humps, cactus spines)
- **Behavioural adaptations**: Actions (migration, hibernation)
- **Functional adaptations**: Internal processes (venom production, antibiotic resistance)

---

## Genetics and Inheritance

### DNA, Genes, and Chromosomes

#### GCSE Foundation

Genetics represents one of the most abstract concepts in school biology. GCSE specifications require understanding:

- The genome is the entire genetic material of an organism
- DNA is a polymer made of nucleotides containing a sugar, phosphate, and base
- The double helix structure with complementary base pairing (A-T, C-G)
- Genes are sections of DNA coding for proteins
- Chromosomes carry genes in their DNA

**Chromosome Numbers**

- Human body cells contain 46 chromosomes (23 pairs)
- One chromosome of each pair comes from each parent
- Gametes (sex cells) contain 23 chromosomes (haploid)
- Fertilisation restores the diploid number (46)

### Inheritance Patterns

**Sexual and Asexual Reproduction**

Students compare reproductive strategies:

- **Sexual reproduction**: Involves gametes, produces genetic variation through meiosis and fertilisation
- **Asexual reproduction**: No gametes involved, produces genetically identical clones
- Advantages and disadvantages of each strategy in different contexts

**Monohybrid Inheritance**

The principles of Mendelian inheritance are studied:

- Alleles are different versions of the same gene
- Dominant alleles mask recessive alleles in heterozygotes
- Genetic diagrams (Punnett squares) predict offspring ratios
- Phenotypic ratios in monohybrid crosses

**Inherited Disorders**

Specific examples illustrate inheritance patterns:

- **Polydactyly**: Caused by a dominant allele
- **Cystic fibrosis**: Caused by a recessive allele
- **Sickle cell disease**: Caused by a recessive allele, carriers have malaria resistance

**Pedigree Analysis**

Students interpret family trees to track inheritance patterns through generations.

### Variation

**Sources of Variation**

Genetic variation arises from:

- **Meiosis**: Independent assortment and crossing over during gamete formation
- **Fertilisation**: Random fusion of gametes
- **Mutations**: Changes in DNA that may be inherited

**Types of Variation**

- **Continuous variation**: Shows a range (height, mass), often polygenic and influenced by environment
- **Discontinuous variation**: Distinct categories (blood group, sex), usually controlled by single genes

**Selective Breeding**

Artificial selection principles:

- Choosing parents with desirable characteristics
- Crossing and selecting offspring over generations
- Examples in agriculture (crops, livestock) and domestic animals

---

## Evolution

### The Theory of Evolution

#### Key Stage 3 Introduction

Key Stage 3 pupils learn that:

- Life on Earth has changed over time
- Fossils provide evidence for evolution
- Organisms are adapted to their environments
- Adaptations may become less suitable if the environment changes

#### GCSE Depth: Natural Selection

GCSE specifications cover natural selection in detail:

**Darwin's Theory**

1. **Variation**: Individuals within a species show variation
2. **Competition**: More offspring are produced than can survive
3. **Survival**: Individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive
4. **Reproduction**: Surviving individuals pass advantageous traits to offspring
5. **Evolution**: Over generations, advantageous traits become more common

**Evidence for Evolution**

Students study multiple lines of evidence:

- **Fossil record**: Transitional forms showing gradual change
- **DNA evidence**: Similarities in genetic code between related species
- **Anatomical comparisons**: Homologous structures indicating common ancestry
- **Embryological similarities**: Shared developmental patterns

### Speciation

**The Process of Speciation**

New species arise when populations become reproductively isolated:

- **Geographic isolation**: Physical barriers separate populations
- **Genetic divergence**: Mutations and selection act independently in isolated groups
- **Reproductive isolation**: Accumulated differences prevent interbreeding

Examples include Darwin's finches and the peppered moth.

### Extinction

**Causes of Extinction**

Students learn about factors leading to species extinction:

- Environmental changes beyond tolerance ranges
- New predators or competitors
- Disease outbreaks
- Habitat destruction
- Inability to adapt quickly enough

### Understanding Evolution: Common Misconceptions

Research indicates several persistent misconceptions pupils hold:

- **Lamarckian thinking**: Believing acquired characteristics can be inherited
- **Teleological reasoning**: Thinking evolution has a purpose or goal
- **Anthropomorphism**: Attributing intention to evolutionary processes
- **Essentialism**: Viewing species as fixed types rather than variable populations

Effective teaching explicitly addresses these misconceptions through careful use of language and explicit discussion of the mechanism of natural selection without implying purpose or intention.

## Pedagogical Approaches in Biology

### Addressing Abstract Concepts

Biology contains numerous abstract concepts that challenge learners:

- **Cellular and molecular processes**: Using models, animations, and analogies
- **Evolution**: Emphasising the non-directed nature of natural selection
- **Genetics**: Connecting observable traits to invisible genetic mechanisms

Ofsted's Research Review (2021) notes that effective science teaching breaks complex concepts into manageable components while maintaining connections to the bigger picture.

### Practical Work

Biology practical work serves multiple purposes:

- **Observational skills**: Microscopy, fieldwork, dissection
- **Investigative skills**: Designing fair tests, controlling variables
- **Data handling**: Recording, presenting, and analysing biological data

Required practicals at GCSE include:

- Microscopy and cell measurement
- Osmosis investigations
- Enzyme activity
- Photosynthesis investigations
- Reaction time testing
- Field population sampling

### Addressing Misconceptions

Research-informed teaching identifies and challenges common biology misconceptions:

- Plants "eating" food rather than making it through photosynthesis
- Respiration as breathing rather than cellular energy release
- Evolution as purposeful improvement rather than adaptation to environment
- Dominant alleles being "stronger" or "better"

Effective pedagogy surfaces pupils' existing ideas and provides opportunities for conceptual restructuring through carefully designed activities and explicit discussion.

## Transport Systems in Organisms

### Transport in Plants

**Xylem and Transpiration**

The xylem tissue transports water and dissolved minerals from roots to leaves. This movement occurs through several mechanisms:

- **Root pressure**: Active transport of minerals into root hairs creates a water potential gradient
- **Transpiration pull**: Evaporation from leaves creates tension that pulls water up the xylem
- **Capillary action**: Water molecules are attracted to xylem walls and to each other

Transpiration rate is affected by environmental factors:

- **Light intensity**: Stomata open in light, increasing transpiration
- **Temperature**: Higher temperatures increase evaporation rates
- **Humidity**: Lower humidity increases the water potential gradient
- **Air movement**: Wind removes water vapour, maintaining the gradient

**Phloem and Translocation**

The phloem transports dissolved sugars (primarily sucrose) from sources to sinks:

- **Sources**: Leaves (photosynthesis), storage organs releasing starch
- **Sinks**: Growing points, roots, developing fruits, storage organs accumulating starch

This process, called translocation, requires energy and moves substances in both directions.

### Transport in Animals

**Single and Double Circulation**

Fish possess single circulation where blood passes through the heart once per circuit. Mammals have double circulation:

- **Pulmonary circuit**: Heart → Lungs → Heart (oxygenation)
- **Systemic circuit**: Heart → Body → Heart (oxygen delivery)

This separation maintains high pressure for efficient systemic delivery while protecting delicate lung capillaries.

**Coronary Circulation**

The heart muscle itself requires oxygen and nutrients, supplied by coronary arteries. Blockage causes myocardial infarction (heart attack).

**Lymphatic System**

GCSE specifications may include the lymphatic system:

- Collects tissue fluid that leaves capillaries
- Returns fluid to the bloodstream
- Contains lymph nodes that filter pathogens
- Transports lymphocytes for immune responses

---

## Coordination and Control

### The Nervous System

The nervous system coordinates rapid responses to stimuli.

**Structure and Function**

- **Sensory neurones**: Carry impulses from receptors to CNS
- **Relay neurones**: Found in the CNS, connect sensory and motor neurones
- **Motor neurones**: Carry impulses from CNS to effectors (muscles/glands)

**Reflex Arcs**

Reflex actions provide rapid, automatic responses:

1. Receptor detects stimulus
2. Sensory neurone transmits impulse
3. Relay neurone in spinal cord processes
4. Motor neurone transmits to effector
5. Effector responds

This bypasses the brain for speed, though the brain receives information.

**The Brain**

GCSE covers major brain regions:

- **Cerebrum**: Conscious thought, intelligence, memory, learning
- **Cerebellum**: Coordination and balance
- **Medulla**: Controls unconscious activities (breathing, heart rate)

### The Endocrine System

Hormones provide slower, longer-lasting chemical coordination.

**Key Hormones**

| Hormone | Gland | Target | Effect |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| Adrenaline | Adrenal glands | Heart, liver, muscles | Fight or flight response |
| Insulin | Pancreas | Liver, muscles | Lowers blood glucose |
| Glucagon | Pancreas | Liver | Raises blood glucose |
| Testosterone | Testes | Male reproductive system | Sperm production, secondary characteristics |
| Oestrogen | Ovaries | Uterus, pituitary | Menstrual cycle, secondary characteristics |
| Progesterone | Ovaries | Uterus | Maintains pregnancy |
| FSH | Pituitary | Ovaries/testes | Stimulates gamete production |
| LH | Pituitary | Ovaries/testes | Triggers ovulation/testosterone |
| Thyroxine | Thyroid | Metabolic rate | Regulates metabolism |

**Blood Glucose Regulation**

Negative feedback maintains blood glucose homeostasis:

- High glucose → Insulin released → Glucose converted to glycogen in liver → Glucose level falls
- Low glucose → Glucagon released → Glycogen converted to glucose → Glucose level rises

Diabetes occurs when this system fails: Type 1 (autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells) and Type 2 (target cells become resistant to insulin).

### Plant Responses

Plants respond to environmental stimuli through hormones rather than a nervous system.

**Auxins**

Auxins are produced in shoot tips and control:

- **Phototropism**: Growth towards light (auxins accumulate on shaded side, causing cell elongation)
- **Gravitropism**: Roots grow downwards, shoots grow upwards
- **Apical dominance**: Terminal bud suppresses lateral bud growth

**Commercial Applications**

- Rooting powders (auxins) for cuttings
- Selective weedkillers (synthetic auxins that disrupt broad-leaved plants)
- Fruit ripening control (ethylene)

---

## Reproduction

### Sexual Reproduction in Humans

**Male Reproductive System**

- **Testes**: Produce sperm and testosterone (in scrotum for lower temperature)
- **Sperm ducts**: Transport sperm
- **Prostate gland**: Produces fluid nourishing sperm
- **Urethra**: Carries sperm and urine (not simultaneously)
- **Penis**: Delivers sperm to female reproductive system

**Female Reproductive System**

- **Ovaries**: Produce eggs (ova) and oestrogen/progesterone
- **Oviducts (Fallopian tubes)**: Site of fertilisation
- **Uterus**: Where embryo develops
- **Cervix**: Opening between uterus and vagina
- **Vagina**: Receives penis during intercourse, birth canal

**The Menstrual Cycle**

The approximately 28-day cycle involves:

- **Days 1-5**: Menstruation (uterus lining shed)
- **Days 1-14**: Follicular phase (FSH stimulates egg development, oestrogen repairs uterus)
- **Day 14**: Ovulation (LH surge releases egg)
- **Days 15-28**: Luteal phase (progesterone maintains uterus lining)

If fertilisation occurs, progesterone continues production; if not, levels fall and menstruation begins.

**Fertilisation and Development**

- Fertilisation occurs in oviduct, forming a zygote
- Cell division forms a ball of cells (embryo) that implants in uterus
- Placenta develops for nutrient/waste exchange; umbilical cord connects embryo
- Antenatal care includes monitoring health, avoiding teratogens, maintaining nutrition

**Contraception**

Methods prevent pregnancy through various mechanisms:

- **Barrier methods**: Condoms, diaphragms (prevent sperm meeting egg)
- **Hormonal methods**: Pill, implant, injection (prevent ovulation)
- **Intrauterine devices**: Prevent implantation
- **Surgical methods**: Vasectomy (males), sterilisation (females)
- **Natural methods**: Abstinence, rhythm method

### Plant Reproduction

**Sexual Reproduction**

Flowering plants reproduce sexually:

- **Pollination**: Transfer of pollen from anther to stigma (self or cross)
- **Fertilisation**: Pollen tube grows to ovule, two male nuclei fuse with egg and polar nuclei
- **Seed development**: Embryo and food store form within seed coat
- **Fruit formation**: Ovary develops into fruit aiding dispersal

**Asexual Reproduction**

Plants can reproduce vegetatively:

- **Runners**: Horizontal stems producing new plants (strawberries)
- **Tubers**: Swollen underground stems (potatoes)
- **Bulbs**: Underground buds with fleshy leaves (daffodils)

Commercial applications include taking cuttings and tissue culture (micropropagation).

**Vaccination**

Vaccines stimulate active immunity:

- Contains weakened pathogens or antigens
- Stimulates antibody production without disease
- Memory cells provide rapid response to future infection
- Herd immunity protects vulnerable unvaccinated individuals

**Antibiotics and Antibiotic Resistance**

- Antibiotics kill bacteria (not viruses)
- Overuse leads to resistant strains through natural selection
- MRSA and other resistant infections pose serious threats
- Prudent antibiotic use is essential

**Risk Factors**

Lifestyle and genetic factors affect disease risk:

- **Smoking**: Lung cancer, COPD, heart disease
- **Diet**: Obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease
- **Alcohol**: Liver disease, certain cancers
- **Exercise**: Lack increases cardiovascular and diabetes risk

**Cardiovascular Disease**

- **Coronary heart disease**: Narrowed arteries due to fatty deposits (atheroma)
- **Stroke**: Blocked or burst blood vessel in brain
- Risk factors include smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, inactivity

**Cancer**

- Uncontrolled cell division forming tumours
- **Benign tumours**: Confined, not cancerous
- **Malignant tumours**: Invade tissues, spread (metastasise)
- Risk factors include smoking, UV radiation, carcinogens, genetic factors
