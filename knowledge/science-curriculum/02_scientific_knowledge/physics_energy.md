# Physics: Energy Stores, Transfers and Efficiency

## Introduction to Energy Concepts

Energy represents one of the most fundamental concepts in physics, describing the capacity of a system to do work or produce change. The contemporary approach to teaching energy, championed by the Institute of Physics and reflected in current GCSE specifications, emphasises a "stores and transfers" model that replaces earlier terminology. Rather than speaking of "types" of energy that transform into one another, physicists now describe energy as residing in identifiable stores and moving between those stores via specific transfer pathways.

## Energy Stores: Where Energy Resides

### Kinetic Energy Store

The kinetic energy store contains energy possessed by moving objects. Any object in motion holds energy proportional to both its mass and the square of its velocity. Doubling an object's velocity quadruples its kinetic energy. Students often confuse constant speed with no energy transfer; effective teaching addresses this through careful attention to language and demonstrations using rolling balls and collisions.

### Gravitational Potential Energy Store

This store contains energy possessed by objects positioned within gravitational fields. When an object is raised against gravity, work is done and stored as gravitational potential energy. A rollercoaster at the top of a hill possesses maximum gravitational potential and minimum kinetic energy; as it descends, energy transfers between stores while the sum remains approximately constant. Students must understand that only changes in gravitational potential energy—not absolute values—have physical significance.

### Elastic Potential Energy Store

Energy stored in stretched or compressed objects resides in the elastic potential store. Stretching a spring twice as far requires four times the energy—a non-linear relationship explained by the spring constant and Hooke's law. Catapults, trampolines, and wind-up toys provide practical demonstrations.

### Thermal Energy Store

Associated with random particle motion, this store requires careful teaching because students conflate temperature with thermal energy. A spark from a firework reaches 1,000°C but possesses minimal thermal energy due to its tiny mass; warm bath water contains vastly more. The thermal store plays a central role in understanding energy dissipation.

### Chemical Energy Store

Energy stored in molecular bonds powers biological systems through cellular respiration and drives combustion of fossil fuels. This store bridges physics and chemistry, with physics emphasising quantification of energy transfers rather than molecular mechanisms.

### Nuclear Energy Store

Energy stored within atomic nuclei is vastly more concentrated than chemical energy. Nuclear fission powers current stations; fusion remains under development. Teaching focuses on mass-energy equivalence and environmental implications.

## Energy Transfers: How Energy Moves

### Mechanical Working

Occurs when forces move objects. Work done equals force multiplied by distance in the direction of force. Friction dissipates energy into thermal stores. Holding a heavy object stationary involves no energy transfer despite muscular effort.

### Heating by Particles (Conduction)

Energy transfers through direct particle interactions. Metals conduct efficiently via delocalised electrons; insulators conduct poorly. Students often believe metals are "naturally cold" when they are simply effective conductors drawing thermal energy from skin.

### Heating by Radiation

Transfers energy via electromagnetic waves without material medium. Earth receives solar energy entirely through radiation. All objects emit thermal radiation depending on temperature—hotter objects emit more at shorter wavelengths.

### Electrical Working

Occurs when charge moves through potential difference. Energy transferred equals charge multiplied by voltage, leading to power equals current times voltage. This enables calculation of energy consumption and comparison of appliance efficiencies.

## Conservation and Dissipation

### Conservation Principle

Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or dissipated. In closed systems, total energy remains constant. Real systems dissipate energy into surroundings through air resistance and friction.

### Dissipation and Entropy

While conserved in quantity, energy degrades in quality through dissipation, spreading into thermal stores and becoming less available for work. The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy always increases, explaining why heat flows from hot to cold and why engines cannot achieve 100% efficiency.

### Energy Saving Clarification

When households "save energy," no energy is destroyed—electricity drawn is simply reduced. What is saved are energy resources and money. Scientifically accurate descriptions emphasise reducing consumption while recognising transferred energy still exists in thermal stores.

## Efficiency

### Definition and Calculation

Efficiency equals useful energy output divided by total input, expressed as percentage. An efficiency of 100% represents perfect conversion; real devices always operate below this. Incandescent bulbs achieve ~5% efficiency; LEDs reach 30-40%. Electric motors operate at 85-95%, while car engines achieve only 20-30%.

### Sankey Diagrams

Visual representations with arrow widths proportional to energy. Input splits into useful output and dissipation pathways. The sum of outputs equals input, embodying conservation. Students must decide what constitutes "useful" based on device purpose.

### Improving Efficiency

Strategies include lubrication reducing friction, insulation maintaining thermal energy, streamlined design reducing air resistance, and regenerative systems capturing otherwise dissipated energy. Combined heat and power plants exemplify efficiency maximisation by utilising waste heat.

## Renewable and Non-Renewable Energy Resources

### Fossil Fuels

Coal, oil, and natural gas represent stored chemical energy from ancient organisms. Combustion releases energy but produces carbon dioxide, driving climate change. These finite resources require millions of years to form, making them non-renewable on human timescales.

### Nuclear Fuels

Uranium and plutonium provide concentrated energy through fission. While low-carbon during operation, concerns include radioactive waste management, accident risks, and finite uranium supplies. Nuclear offers baseload power independent of weather conditions.

### Solar Energy

Photovoltaic cells convert sunlight directly to electricity; solar thermal systems use sunlight to heat water. Solar power is intermittent, requiring storage or backup systems, but costs have decreased dramatically making it increasingly competitive.

### Wind Energy

Turbines convert kinetic energy of moving air to electrical energy. Like solar, wind is intermittent but highly scalable. Offshore wind farms exploit stronger, more consistent winds while minimising land use conflicts.

### Hydroelectric Power

Utilises gravitational potential energy of elevated water. Offers dispatchable renewable energy, though suitable sites are limited and large dams create significant environmental and social impacts.

### Geothermal and Tidal

Geothermal energy exploits Earth's internal heat; tidal harnesses gravitational effects of Moon and Sun. Both provide predictable renewable energy but are geographically constrained.

## Power: Rate of Energy Transfer

Power measures how quickly energy is transferred, defined as energy transferred divided by time. The unit of power, the watt, equals one joule per second. Understanding power enables comparison of appliance consumption and calculation of electricity costs.

Higher power devices transfer energy more rapidly, completing tasks faster but consuming more energy overall. A high-power kettle boils water quickly; a lower-power kettle achieves the same temperature change using the same total energy but taking longer.

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Addressing Misconceptions

Common misconceptions include: energy being "used up" (rather than conserved and dissipated), temperature measuring total energy, and force and energy being interchangeable. The stores and transfers model explicitly addresses these through consistent language and conceptual framing.

### Practical Work

Effective practical work includes: rollercoaster demonstrations showing energy transfers, Sankey diagram construction, efficiency measurements of simple machines, and comparisons of appliance power ratings. Real-world contexts—household energy bills, transport efficiency, renewable energy debates—motivate student engagement.

### Progression from KS3 to KS4

Key Stage 3 focuses on qualitative understanding: identifying stores, describing transfers, and appreciating conservation. Key Stage 4 introduces quantitative calculations: kinetic and gravitational potential energy equations, efficiency percentages, and power calculations. This progression builds secure foundations before mathematical demands increase.

## Conclusion

Understanding energy stores, transfers, and efficiency provides essential scientific literacy for contemporary citizenship. Climate change, energy security, and sustainable development all require citizens who can reason quantitatively about energy. Physics education in this domain prepares students for informed participation in debates about energy policy and personal energy choices.
