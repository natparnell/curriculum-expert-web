# Reading Pedagogy in English Education

## Overview and Curriculum Context

Reading lies at the heart of English education, serving simultaneously as a fundamental skill, a gateway to learning across the curriculum, and a source of lifelong pleasure and enrichment. The Department for Education's Reading Framework (July 2023) establishes that reading comprises two distinct but interrelated processes: word reading (decoding) and comprehension. Effective reading pedagogy must address both dimensions systematically while fostering the disposition to read independently and with enjoyment.

The National Curriculum for English (2014) establishes reading as one of the three core strands alongside writing and spoken language. Programmes of Study require pupils to read fluently and with good understanding, develop the habit of reading widely and often, and appreciate our rich and varied literary heritage. These statutory requirements place significant pedagogical demands on teachers, who must balance the teaching of phonics and decoding in early years with the development of sophisticated comprehension strategies as pupils progress through key stages.

Ofsted's Education Inspection Framework includes a mandatory 'reading deep dive' for infant and primary schools, reflecting the inspectorate's recognition that reading proficiency underpins success across all curriculum areas. This scrutiny requires schools to demonstrate coherent reading pedagogy, from early phonics instruction through to sustained independent reading, with particular attention to how schools support struggling readers and foster reading for pleasure.

This knowledge base addresses the major pedagogical approaches for teaching reading: systematic synthetic phonics, guided and whole-class reading, reciprocal reading, reading aloud, independent reading, and reading for pleasure interventions. Each approach serves distinct purposes within a comprehensive reading curriculum, and effective teachers understand when and how to deploy each strategy for maximum impact.

## Systematic Synthetic Phonics

### Principles and Evidence Base

Systematic synthetic phonics (SSP) represents the evidence-informed approach to teaching word reading adopted by the Department for Education and mandatory in all state-funded primary schools in England. The approach is 'systematic' because phonemes (sounds) and graphemes (letter patterns) are taught in a carefully planned sequence, and 'synthetic' because pupils learn to synthesise (blend) sounds together to read unfamiliar words.

The evidence base for SSP derives substantially from the work of the National Reading Panel (2000) and subsequent reviews, including the Rose Review (2006) which established the approach for England. Research consistently demonstrates that explicit phonics instruction produces superior outcomes in word reading accuracy and fluency compared to implicit or incidental approaches, particularly for pupils at risk of reading difficulties.

The DfE's Validation of Systematic Synthetic Phonics Programmes (updated 2023) establishes core criteria for effective SSP programmes. Validated programmes must provide complete coverage of the alphabetic code, including the 44 phonemes of English and their common grapheme representations. They must include direct teaching of blending for reading and segmenting for spelling, with cumulative progression ensuring that pupils secure earlier learning before encountering more complex elements.

### Validated SSP Programmes

The DfE maintains a list of validated SSP programmes that schools may adopt. While schools are not statutorily required to select from this list, Ofsted expects schools to demonstrate that their chosen approach meets the core criteria with fidelity. Popular validated programmes include:

**Read Write Inc. Phonics** (Ruth Miskin): Used in over 8,000 UK schools, this programme provides a comprehensive approach with integrated comprehension, handwriting, spelling, and composition. The programme includes rigorous assessment, grouping pupils by attainment for daily phonics sessions, and specific intervention for pupils who fall behind.

**Little Wandle Letters and Sounds Revised**: This programme updates the original Letters and Sounds framework with enhanced resources and training. It provides week-by-week lesson plans, assessments, and keep-up/intervention materials designed to ensure all pupils reach the expected standard by the phonics screening check.

**Bug Club Phonics** (Pearson) and **Big Cat Phonics** (Collins): These programmes combine systematic phonics teaching with fully decodable reading books that align precisely with the grapheme-phoneme correspondences being taught.

Schools adopting SSP programmes must ensure 'fidelity'—using the resources exactly as designed, without supplementation from incompatible approaches. Mixed methods, where phonics is combined with cueing systems that encourage guessing from pictures or context, undermine the systematic approach and are specifically discouraged by the Reading Framework.

### Pedagogical Implementation

Effective SSP teaching follows consistent structural principles across programmes:

**Daily sessions**: Phonics is taught for approximately 20-30 minutes every day, ensuring regular spaced practice that supports retention and automaticity.

**Whole-class teaching with grouping**: While initial instruction is typically whole-class, most programmes incorporate grouping by attainment so that pupils work at the appropriate level for their current knowledge. Groups should be fluid, with regular reassessment enabling pupils to move quickly when they demonstrate mastery.

**Active engagement**: Effective phonics sessions involve all pupils actively—responding in chorus, using physical actions for sounds, writing on whiteboards, and reading aloud. Passive listening is minimised.

**Application to reading and writing**: Phonics learning is immediately applied to reading fully decodable texts and to spelling. This application ensures that phonics is understood as a tool for authentic literacy purposes, not an isolated skill.

**Keep-up and catch-up**: The strongest programmes include specific intervention for pupils who struggle to keep pace with their peers. The DfE emphasises that waiting to fail is unacceptable; early identification and immediate support are essential.

### The Phonics Screening Check

The Year 1 phonics screening check provides a light-touch assessment of pupils' phonics decoding ability. Pupils read 40 words—20 real words and 20 pseudo-words (alien words)—demonstrating their ability to apply phonics to unfamiliar words without relying on memory or context. The check focuses exclusively on decoding, not comprehension.

The expected standard (typically 32/40 words correct) was achieved by 79% of Year 1 pupils nationally in 2024. Schools with high-quality SSP provision and rigorous keep-up intervention typically achieve pass rates exceeding 90%. The check serves as a diagnostic tool, identifying pupils who require additional phonics support in Year 2.

### Limitations and Critiques

While the evidence for SSP in establishing word reading is robust, teachers should understand its limitations:

**Comprehension requires separate attention**: Phonics instruction enables accurate decoding but does not automatically produce comprehension. The simple view of reading (Gough and Tunmer, 1986) posits that reading comprehension is the product of word recognition and language comprehension. SSP addresses the first component; rich language experience and explicit comprehension instruction address the second.

**English orthography complexity**: While SSP teaches regular correspondences, English contains many irregular words (the, was, one) that cannot be decoded phonetically. High-frequency irregular words require direct teaching alongside phonics.

**Older struggling readers**: Pupils who reach Key Stage 2 without secure phonics knowledge require intervention, but approaches must be age-appropriate and dignified. The DfE's Reading Framework provides specific guidance for supporting older pupils with decoding difficulties.

## Guided Reading and Whole-Class Reading

### Guided Reading: The Traditional Approach

Guided reading has been the dominant approach to teaching reading comprehension in English primary schools since the 1990s. In this model, the teacher works with a small group of pupils (typically 6-8) who are reading at similar levels, while other pupils engage in independent activities (the 'carousel' or 'rotations' system).

**Structure of guided reading sessions**:
- Introduction to the text (vocabulary, context, prediction)
- Pupils read independently, either silently or in quiet voices
- Teacher listens to individual pupils, provides prompts and support
- Group discussion focusing on comprehension questions
- Follow-up activity to consolidate learning

**Grouping considerations**: Groups are typically organised by reading attainment, using book band levels or similar levelling systems. Groups should be reassessed regularly to ensure appropriate challenge and to enable movement between groups as pupils progress.

**Teacher role**: During guided reading, the teacher's attention is focused intensively on a small group. This enables precise formative assessment, immediate feedback, and targeted questioning at an appropriate level. However, the teacher is unavailable to support the rest of the class during this time.

**Challenges with guided reading**: Critics identify several limitations of the carousel model:
- Limited teacher time per pupil: With five groups meeting weekly, each pupil receives only 20-30 minutes of teacher-led reading per week
- Quality of independent activities: Research suggests that independent carousel activities often lack challenge and may not advance reading skills
- Management complexity: Organising multiple simultaneous activities demands significant classroom management skill
- Pupil engagement: Pupils working independently may become disengaged or off-task

### The Shift to Whole-Class Reading

Many schools have moved to whole-class reading (also called whole-class guided reading), where all pupils study the same text together under teacher direction. This approach, championed by consultants like Solomon Kingsnorth, addresses several limitations of the carousel model.

**Rationale for whole-class reading**:
- **Equity**: All pupils access high-quality, teacher-led reading instruction every day, not just once per week
- **Challenge**: Pupils can access texts above their independent reading level when supported by teacher scaffolding, shared reading, and partner discussion
- **Efficiency**: No time is lost to carousel transitions and management of independent activities
- **Text quality**: Teachers can use ambitious, engaging texts that would be impractical to provide in sets for six different groups

**Pedagogical structure**: Whole-class reading sessions typically follow a consistent pattern:
1. **Text introduction** (5 minutes): Context, vocabulary pre-teaching, prediction
2. **Teacher reading aloud** (10-15 minutes): Modelling fluent, expressive reading with thinking aloud
3. **Pupil reading** (10-15 minutes): Choral reading, partner reading, or selected pupils reading aloud
4. **Comprehension focus** (10 minutes): Explicit teaching of comprehension strategy, discussion questions, vocabulary exploration
5. **Independent response** (10-15 minutes): Written answers, vocabulary work, or creative response

**Differentiation within whole-class reading**: Rather than differentiating by text difficulty, whole-class reading differentiates by support and expected outcome. Struggling readers may work with teaching assistant support, use text-to-speech technology, or focus on specific aspects of the text. Extension activities provide challenge for fluent readers.

### Choosing Between Approaches

The Education People (Kent County Council) advises that both guided and whole-class reading can be effective when implemented well. The choice depends on school context, teacher expertise, and pupil needs. Some schools successfully combine approaches:
- Whole-class reading for core English lessons, focusing on high-quality literature
- Guided reading for targeted intervention with specific groups
- Independent reading for practice and reading for pleasure

Ofsted's inspection framework does not mandate either approach. What matters is that schools help children become fluent, independent readers with strong comprehension, using methods that achieve results for all pupils including the most disadvantaged.

## Reciprocal Reading

### Origins and Theoretical Basis

Reciprocal reading, developed by Annemarie Palincsar and Ann Brown (1984), is an instructional approach that teaches comprehension strategies through collaborative dialogue. The approach aims to help pupils actively construct meaning from text by applying four key strategies: predicting, questioning, clarifying, and summarising.

The theoretical foundation lies in Vygotskian social constructivism—pupils learn comprehension strategies through scaffolded interaction with more knowledgeable others (initially the teacher, then peers). As pupils internalise the strategies, they become self-regulated readers who can monitor their own comprehension.

### The Four Strategies

**Predicting**: Before and during reading, pupils anticipate what will happen next based on their existing knowledge, text features, and what they have read so far. Prediction activates prior knowledge, sets purposes for reading, and creates expectation that engages attention.

**Questioning**: Pupils generate questions about the text—both literal (retrieval) and inferential. Self-questioning focuses attention on key information and establishes purposes for reading. The ability to ask good questions indicates deep engagement with text.

**Clarifying**: When encountering confusing vocabulary, concepts, or text structure, pupils identify what they do not understand and use fix-up strategies: rereading, reading ahead, using context clues, or consulting resources. Clarifying develops metacognitive awareness of comprehension breakdown.

**Summarising**: Pupils identify the most important information and restate it concisely. Summarising requires discriminating essential from non-essential information and synthesising across the text.

### Pedagogical Implementation

Reciprocal reading is typically implemented in small groups (4-8 pupils) with sessions lasting 20-30 minutes. The approach follows a structured sequence:

**Teacher modelling**: Initially, the teacher demonstrates all four strategies while thinking aloud, showing how skilled readers actively construct meaning. The teacher explains why each strategy is useful and when to apply it.

**Guided practice**: The teacher gradually releases responsibility, prompting pupils to use the strategies. A key technique is the 'reciprocal' structure where pupils take turns leading the discussion in the role of 'teacher', applying the four strategies to segments of text.

**Independent application**: As pupils become proficient, they apply the strategies independently during their own reading, internalising the comprehension monitoring process.

### Evidence and Current Use

The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) identifies reciprocal reading as a promising approach, with studies showing positive effects on reading comprehension. The EEF's trial of FFT Reciprocal Reading found that the approach produced additional progress for pupils, particularly when delivered by trained teaching assistants.

In UK schools, reciprocal reading is often used as:
- A targeted intervention for pupils who struggle with comprehension
- A teaching approach for small groups within whole-class reading sessions
- A peer tutoring approach where trained older pupils support younger readers

Reciprocal reading is particularly valuable for teaching pupils to monitor their own comprehension and use fix-up strategies when understanding breaks down—skills essential for independent reading.

## Reading Aloud

### Purposes and Benefits

Reading aloud to pupils serves multiple pedagogical purposes that persist throughout primary and into secondary education. While often associated with early years, the Commission on Reading identified reading aloud as "the single most important activity for building knowledge required for eventual success in reading" at all ages.

**Modelling fluent reading**: When teachers read aloud with appropriate expression, pace, and intonation, they demonstrate what fluent reading sounds like. This modelling is particularly important for pupils who do not experience fluent reading at home.

**Vocabulary acquisition**: Listening to texts above their independent reading level exposes pupils to vocabulary, syntactic structures, and concepts they would not encounter otherwise. Research indicates that most vocabulary acquisition occurs indirectly through listening and reading, not through explicit instruction.

**Engagement with literature**: Reading aloud enables teachers to share engaging, challenging texts that pupils might not choose or be able to read independently. The social experience of sharing a story creates community and motivates pupils to read independently.

**Developing listening comprehension**: Listening comprehension typically exceeds reading comprehension, particularly for younger pupils. Reading aloud enables pupils to engage with complex narratives and ideas that would be inaccessible through independent reading.

### Interactive Read-Alouds

Research by Douglas Fisher and Nancy Frey distinguishes between simple reading aloud and 'interactive read-alouds' where the teacher strategically pauses to model thinking, ask questions, and engage pupils in discussion. The Read Write Think framework identifies three levels of response:

**Within the text**: Responses tied directly to text content—retrieval, literal comprehension, identifying story elements
**About the text**: Responses examining the text as a constructed object—author's craft, text structure, genre conventions
**Beyond the text**: Responses connecting the text to personal experience, other texts, or broader issues—thematic connections, intertextual links, real-world applications

Effective interactive read-alouds involve planning: the teacher identifies teaching points, vocabulary for discussion, and stopping points for pupil engagement before reading.

### Practice and Implementation

The DfE Reading Framework recommends that teachers read aloud to pupils throughout primary school, not just in early years. Suggestions include:
- Daily story time in EYFS and KS1, focusing on enjoyment and engagement
- Regular reading aloud of challenging texts in KS2, stopping to explain vocabulary and discuss ideas
- Reading aloud non-fiction, poetry, and extended narratives across the curriculum
- Using audiobooks and other recorded readings to supplement teacher reading

Reading aloud should not be limited to English lessons. Reading historical accounts in history, scientific explanations in science, and mathematical problems in maths demonstrates how reading serves learning across the curriculum.

## Independent Reading

### Sustained Silent Reading (SSR)

Sustained Silent Reading (SSR), also known as DEAR (Drop Everything and Read), USSR (Uninterrupted Sustained Silent Reading), or simply independent reading time, involves dedicating regular classroom time for pupils to read self-selected books silently. Originating in the 1960s, SSR aims to increase reading volume, build reading stamina, and foster reading for pleasure.

**Key principles of effective SSR**:
- Everyone reads: The teacher models the importance of reading by reading silently alongside pupils
- Self-selection: Pupils choose their own reading material (within appropriate parameters)
- No interruptions: The time is protected; no testing, worksheets, or written responses
- Regular scheduling: SSR occurs at the same time daily so pupils anticipate and prepare for it
- Sufficient duration: Sessions should be long enough for pupils to become absorbed (minimum 15-20 minutes)

### Evidence and Critiques

The research on SSR presents a mixed picture. Stephen Krashen and others argue that increased reading volume produces gains in vocabulary, comprehension, and writing. However, meta-analyses indicate that SSR alone produces modest effects compared to explicit instruction. The National Reading Panel (2000) found insufficient evidence to recommend independent reading as a substitute for direct teaching.

Critics identify several implementation challenges:
- **Monitoring**: Without accountability measures, some pupils may use SSR time unproductively
- **Book access**: SSR requires well-stocked classroom libraries with texts at appropriate levels and of interest to pupils
- **Reading difficulty**: Pupils who struggle with decoding may find silent reading frustrating rather than pleasurable
- **Differentiation**: A single SSR period may not meet the needs of all pupils

### Research-Informed Implementation

More recent approaches to independent reading incorporate elements that address these limitations:

**Accountability without testing**: Pupils maintain reading logs, have reading conferences with the teacher, or share book recommendations with peers. These measures provide accountability without undermining pleasure.

**Scaffolded selection**: Teachers support pupils in selecting appropriately challenging books, using 'five-finger rule' (if you miss more than five words on a page, the book is too hard) or interest inventories to match readers with texts.

**Targeted support**: Pupils who struggle with silent reading may use text-to-speech technology, read with a partner, or participate in small-group guided reading while others read independently.

**Teacher conferences**: Regular one-to-one reading conferences (2-3 minutes per pupil) enable teachers to check understanding, discuss books, and provide recommendations. These conversations provide formative assessment and personalise the reading experience.

The Education Endowment Foundation recommends that independent reading should supplement, not replace, explicit teaching. Schools should ensure that struggling readers receive intensive phonics intervention while also having access to engaging books and protected reading time.

## Reading for Pleasure Interventions

### Concept and Rationale

Reading for pleasure (RfP) refers to reading that is freely chosen and done for its own sake rather than for external rewards or assessment. Research consistently demonstrates strong correlations between reading for pleasure and educational outcomes: pupils who read frequently for enjoyment achieve higher attainment in reading, writing, and even mathematics.

However, international surveys indicate declining reading for pleasure among young people, particularly as they progress through secondary school. The OECD's PISA studies consistently find that reading enjoyment is a stronger predictor of reading achievement than socioeconomic status. These findings have prompted significant attention to fostering reading for pleasure in schools.

Teresa Cremin and colleagues at The Open University identify three interconnected elements that support RfP:
- **Reader identity**: Developing pupils' sense of themselves as readers with preferences, habits, and opinions
- **Social reading environment**: Creating communities where reading is talked about, shared, and valued
- **Access and choice**: Providing diverse, appealing texts and time to read them

### Pedagogical Approaches

The Literacy Hive identifies three layers of RfP pedagogy that build on these foundations:

**Planned time for reading aloud**: Regular teacher reading aloud introduces pupils to engaging texts, models enthusiasm for reading, and creates shared reading experiences that become reference points for classroom community.

**Independent reading with book choice**: Pupils need protected time to read self-selected books at school. This demonstrates that reading is valued and provides immediate access to books for those who lack them at home.

**Book talk and recommendations**: Creating opportunities for pupils to discuss their reading, recommend books to peers, and hear about texts others have enjoyed. This social dimension transforms reading from solitary activity to shared cultural practice.

### Teacher Knowledge and Engagement

Cremin's research emphasises that teachers who are themselves readers and who share their reading lives with pupils create more vibrant reading communities. Teacher knowledge of children's literature enables knowledgeable recommendations that match readers with appropriate and appealing texts. The UKLA Teachers as Readers research found that many teachers lack confidence in their knowledge of children's books, limiting their ability to recommend texts effectively.

Professional development for RfP should focus on:
- Building teachers' knowledge of children's and young adult literature
- Creating opportunities for teachers to read and discuss books collaboratively
- Developing strategies for creating reading communities in classrooms
- Understanding the reading lives and preferences of pupils

### Practical Interventions

**Reading corners and classroom libraries**: Well-stocked, inviting reading areas signal that reading matters. Books should be displayed attractively, with covers visible, regularly refreshed, and organised to help pupils find appealing texts.

**Reading buddies and peer recommendation**: Pairing younger pupils with older reading buddies, creating book recommendation displays by pupils, and using book talk to share reading experiences all build social engagement with reading.

**Author visits and book events**: Encounters with authors, World Book Day celebrations, book fairs, and reading challenges create excitement and community around reading.

**Parental engagement**: Involving parents through reading workshops, book lending libraries, and guidance on supporting reading at home extends the reading culture beyond school.

### Measuring Reading for Pleasure

The DfE's Reading for Pleasure Audit provides a framework for evaluating school provision. Key indicators include:
- Pupil surveys asking about reading frequency, preferences, and attitudes
- Analysis of library borrowing data
- Observations of reading behaviour during independent reading time
- Book corner quality audits
- Staff surveys on professional knowledge of children's literature

Schools should avoid relying solely on easily measured but misleading indicators such as book review completion or reading scheme progression, which may capture compliance rather than genuine engagement.

## Reading Comprehension Strategies

### Explicit Strategy Instruction

While phonics teaches word reading, comprehension requires separate pedagogical attention. The National Reading Panel identified explicit comprehension strategy instruction as one of five essential components of reading instruction. Effective approaches teach strategies directly, explaining what the strategy is, why it is useful, when to use it, and how to apply it.

Research by the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) identifies seven strategies with strong evidence bases:

**Monitoring comprehension**: Teaching pupils to notice when understanding breaks down and use fix-up strategies (rereading, reading ahead, using context, consulting resources).

**Metacognition**: Developing pupils' awareness of their own thinking processes and ability to regulate their reading strategically.

**Graphic organisers**: Using visual representations (story maps, Venn diagrams, flow charts) to organise text information and show relationships.

**Question answering**: Teaching pupils to locate or construct answers to different question types (literal, inferential, evaluative).

**Question generation**: Supporting pupils to formulate their own questions about texts, which focuses attention and establishes purposes for reading.

**Summarising**: Teaching pupils to identify main ideas and supporting details, discriminating essential from non-essential information.

**Multiple strategies**: Combining several strategies within reciprocal reading or similar integrated approaches.

### Teaching Text Structures

Comprehension is enhanced when pupils understand how different text types are structured. Explicit teaching of narrative structure (setting, character, plot, resolution) and non-fiction structures (chronological, cause-effect, problem-solution, compare-contrast) provides frameworks for organising information.

Text structure instruction includes:
- Identifying signal words that indicate structure (because, therefore, however, similarly)
- Using graphic organisers that match text structure
- Teaching pupils to preview text structure before reading
- Writing using target structures to reinforce understanding

### Vocabulary Instruction

Vocabulary knowledge is strongly predictive of reading comprehension. While most vocabulary is acquired indirectly through reading and listening, explicit instruction addresses essential academic vocabulary and strategies for inferring word meanings.

Effective vocabulary instruction:
- Pre-teaches essential words before reading
- Uses student-friendly definitions and contextual examples
- Provides multiple exposures across different contexts
- Teaches word-learning strategies (using context clues, analysing word parts)
- Develops word consciousness and curiosity about language

## Progression Across Key Stages

### Early Years and Key Stage 1 (Ages 4-7)

Priority: Establishing word reading through systematic synthetic phonics and building positive relationships with reading.

**EYFS**: Daily story time, phonics games, environmental print exploration, talking about books and stories. The EYFS Framework's Literacy area of learning emphasises enjoyment of books and developing phonological awareness.

**Year 1**: Daily SSP teaching with grouping by attainment. Phonics screening check in June. Reading books that are fully decodable using taught grapheme-phoneme correspondences. Daily story time continuing.

**Year 2**: Consolidation of phonics for most pupils. Shift toward increasing comprehension focus. Pupils who did not meet the phonics screening standard receive targeted intervention while studying the Year 2 curriculum.

### Key Stage 2 (Ages 7-11)

Priority: Developing reading fluency, comprehension strategies, and reading for pleasure.

**Years 3-4**: Continued support for pupils with weak decoding. Building reading stamina and fluency through regular practice. Explicit teaching of comprehension strategies. Increasing range of text types.

**Years 5-6**: Sophisticated comprehension work using challenging texts. Analysis of authorial technique and text structure. Preparation for secondary reading demands. Sustained focus on reading for pleasure and independence.

By the end of Key Stage 2, pupils should read fluently and with good understanding, drawing inferences and justifying these with evidence. They should read widely across fiction and non-fiction, demonstrating preferences and engaging in critical discussion.

### Key Stage 3 and Beyond (Ages 11-16)

Priority: Reading for learning across the curriculum, critical analysis, and maintaining reading for pleasure.

**Secondary transition**: Many pupils experience a 'dip' in reading engagement and attainment during the transition to secondary school. Maintaining reading for pleasure programmes, ensuring library access, and continuing teacher reading aloud can mitigate this.

**Disciplinary literacy**: Reading instruction in secondary school must address the specific reading demands of different subjects—reading like a historian, scientist, or mathematician. This requires explicit teaching of subject-specific text structures and vocabulary.

**Academic reading**: As examinations approach, pupils need strategies for reading extended texts efficiently, identifying relevant information, and managing complex syntax and vocabulary.

## Assessment and Monitoring

### Formative Assessment

Effective reading pedagogy depends on continuous formative assessment:

**Running records**: Systematic observation of pupils' oral reading, recording accuracy, fluency, and strategies used. Running records identify whether errors are meaning-based, visual, or syntactic, informing targeted teaching.

**Comprehension checks**: Regular questioning during and after reading, using a mix of literal, inferential, and evaluative questions. Teachers note which pupils struggle with which question types.

**Reading conferences**: Brief one-to-one conversations about books pupils are reading. Conferences reveal engagement, understanding, and ability to articulate responses.

**Phonics assessments**: Regular assessments of grapheme-phoneme knowledge, blending, and segmenting identify pupils who need keep-up or catch-up intervention.

### Standardised Assessment

**Phonics Screening Check**: Year 1 statutory check of phonics decoding ability.

**National Curriculum Tests**: End of Key Stage 1 (optional) and Key Stage 2 statutory tests assess reading comprehension through multiple-choice and short-answer questions based on unseen texts.

**Reading Ages**: Standardised tests (such as New Group Reading Test, Suffolk Reading Scale) provide norm-referenced measures of reading attainment. These can identify pupils falling behind and track progress over time.

### Reading for Pleasure Assessment

Attitude surveys, reading diaries, and engagement observations assess reading for pleasure. The UKLA Reading for Pleasure survey provides validated instruments for measuring attitudes and behaviours.

## Ofsted Reading Deep Dive: Implications for Pedagogy

Ofsted's mandatory reading deep dive in primary inspections examines seven aspects of early reading, with implications for pedagogical practice:

1. **Leadership and management of reading**: Leaders should demonstrate clear understanding of reading pedagogy and ensure consistent implementation across the school.

2. **Intent, implementation, and impact**: Schools should articulate clear ambitions for reading (intent), demonstrate how these are enacted through curriculum and teaching (implementation), and show evidence of outcomes (impact), particularly for disadvantaged pupils.

3. **Phonics and early reading**: Inspectors expect to see rigorous SSP taught with fidelity, effective grouping, and immediate intervention for pupils who fall behind.

4. **Reading across the curriculum**: Reading should be taught and used in all subjects, not just English.

5. **Reading for pleasure**: Schools should demonstrate commitment to fostering reading enjoyment through library provision, story time, book talk, and teacher knowledge of children's literature.

6. **Assessment**: Assessment should identify pupils who need additional support promptly, with effective interventions in place.

7. **Support for struggling readers**: Older pupils who have not mastered decoding should receive age-appropriate phonics intervention alongside access to the wider curriculum.

Schools preparing for inspection should ensure that reading pedagogy is consistent with the Reading Framework and that all teachers understand and implement the agreed approaches.

## Conclusion

Effective reading pedagogy requires a comprehensive approach addressing word reading, comprehension, and reading for pleasure. Systematic synthetic phonics provides the foundation for word reading, while explicit comprehension strategy instruction develops understanding. Reading aloud, guided reading, and whole-class reading provide scaffolded access to challenging texts. Independent reading and reading for pleasure interventions build the habits and dispositions that sustain lifelong reading.

The evidence suggests that no single approach is sufficient. Schools need coherent reading curricula that combine these elements appropriately for different ages and needs. What matters is that approaches are implemented with fidelity, that teachers understand the rationale for their practice, and that assessment identifies pupils who need additional support without delay.

Reading opens doors to learning, enjoyment, and participation in society. The pedagogical choices teachers make profoundly influence whether pupils develop the skills and desire to walk through those doors. By grounding practice in evidence while attending to the particular needs of their pupils, teachers can ensure that all children become confident, capable, and enthusiastic readers.
