# Oracy: Spoken Language Across the Curriculum

## Introduction: The Neglected Pillar of Education

For generations, the English education system has prioritised literacy and numeracy as the foundational pillars of learning, while oracy—the ability to communicate effectively through spoken language—has received considerably less attention. This imbalance is striking given that speaking and listening are the primary modes through which humans communicate, learn, and participate in society. As Neil Mercer and colleagues at Oracy Cambridge have observed, oracy has historically been education's "neglected pillar," despite its fundamental importance to both academic success and life outcomes.

The renewed focus on oracy in recent years reflects growing recognition of its transformative potential. High-quality oracy education enables pupils not merely to learn to talk but to learn through talk. Through carefully structured spoken language opportunities, pupils develop deeper subject knowledge, more sophisticated thinking, and the communication skills essential for employment, citizenship, and personal fulfilment.

This knowledge file explores the theoretical foundations, frameworks, and practical strategies for developing oracy across the curriculum. Drawing on the research of Neil Mercer, the work of Voice 21 and Oracy Cambridge, and established drama conventions, it provides guidance for implementing oracy-rich pedagogy in primary and secondary classrooms.

## Defining Oracy: Learning Through Talk and Learning to Talk

### The Dual Nature of Oracy

Oracy encompasses two interconnected dimensions that must both be addressed in effective pedagogy:

**Learning to Talk (Development of Speaking Skills)**

This dimension focuses on developing pupils' capacity to communicate effectively through spoken language. It involves teaching the knowledge, skills, and dispositions required for successful oral communication across a range of contexts. This includes:

- Linguistic competence: vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and articulation
- Cognitive engagement: reasoning, argumentation, and critical thinking
- Social and emotional awareness: listening, turn-taking, empathy, and audience awareness
- Physical presence: voice projection, posture, and non-verbal communication

**Learning Through Talk (Talk as a Pedagogical Tool)**

This dimension recognises that talk is a powerful medium for learning. When pupils engage in purposeful discussion, they articulate and refine their thinking, build on others' ideas, and develop deeper understanding of curriculum content. As Voice 21 emphasises, high-quality oracy education involves "students learning through talk, whilst also learning to talk."

### Why Oracy Matters

The case for prioritising oracy rests on multiple compelling foundations:

**Academic Achievement**

Research consistently demonstrates strong links between oracy development and academic outcomes. The Education Endowment Foundation identifies oral language interventions as having significant positive impact on learning, with average gains of several months of additional progress. Through talk, pupils process new ideas, clarify understanding, and engage more deeply with subject content.

**Cognitive Development**

Speaking and listening are not merely vehicles for transmitting knowledge but are fundamental to thinking itself. Vygotskian theory posits that language and thought are inextricably linked, with social interaction (particularly talk) playing a crucial role in cognitive development. Through discussion, pupils externalise their thinking, making it available for reflection and refinement.

**Social Mobility and Life Outcomes**

Oracy skills are strongly predictive of life outcomes. Communication skills consistently rank among the most sought-after attributes by employers, yet surveys repeatedly identify gaps between the skills young people possess and those required in the workplace. For pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, who may have fewer opportunities to develop formal communication skills outside school, oracy education is particularly crucial for social mobility.

**Civic Participation**

Democratic citizenship requires the capacity to participate in discussion, listen to diverse perspectives, articulate views, and engage in reasoned debate. Oracy education prepares pupils for active participation in democratic society.

## Theoretical Foundations: Sociocultural Perspectives on Talk

### Vygotsky and the Social Nature of Learning

The theoretical foundations of oracy education draw heavily on sociocultural theory, particularly the work of Lev Vygotsky. Vygotsky emphasised that learning is fundamentally social, occurring through interaction with more knowledgeable others and participation in cultural practices. Language, as the primary tool of thought and communication, mediates this learning.

Key concepts from Vygotsky relevant to oracy include:

**The Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)**

The ZPD describes the distance between what a learner can do independently and what they can achieve with appropriate support. In oracy terms, this means providing scaffolded opportunities for pupils to develop communication skills that are just beyond their current capabilities, with the support of teachers and peers.

**Scaffolding**

Effective talk-based learning requires appropriate scaffolding—temporary support that enables pupils to participate in activities they could not manage alone. This might include sentence stems, talk guidelines, modelling, or structured discussion formats.

### Neil Mercer and Interthinking

Neil Mercer's research at the University of Cambridge has been particularly influential in shaping understanding of how talk supports learning. Mercer's concept of **"interthinking"** captures the ways in which thinking occurs not only within individual minds but between people engaged in joint activity.

Mercer's research identified three distinct types of classroom talk:

**Disputational Talk**

Characterised by disagreement, individualised decision-making, and a lack of collaboration. Pupils in disputational talk tend to reject others' ideas without constructive engagement. While disagreement can be productive, disputational talk in its pure form is not conducive to learning.

**Cumulative Talk**

Characterised by agreement, uncritical acceptance, and accumulation of ideas without sufficient challenge or development. Pupils in cumulative talk build positively on what others say but without critical evaluation or deep exploration.

**Exploratory Talk**

The gold standard for learning through talk. Exploratory talk is characterised by:
- Critical but constructive engagement with others' ideas
- Explicit reasoning: claims are supported with evidence and justification
- Joint consideration of options before decisions are reached
- All participants contributing and being listened to

Mercer's research demonstrates that when teachers establish **ground rules for exploratory talk** and explicitly teach the skills involved, pupils engage in higher-quality discussion and achieve better learning outcomes.

## The Voice 21 Oracy Framework

Voice 21, working in partnership with Oracy Cambridge, has developed a comprehensive framework for oracy education that has been implemented in schools across the UK. This framework provides a structured approach to developing oracy across four strands.

### The Four Strands of Oracy

**Physical Strand**

This strand addresses the physical aspects of spoken communication:
- Voice: projection, pace, pitch, pause, intonation, and clarity
- Language: pronunciation, articulation, fluency, and register
- Non-verbal communication: gesture, eye contact, facial expression, and posture

Teaching the physical strand involves helping pupils develop conscious control over their vocal and physical presence, adapting these elements appropriately for different contexts.

**Linguistic Strand**

This strand encompasses the formal structures of language:
- Vocabulary: choosing precise, appropriate words for purpose and audience
- Grammar and syntax: constructing clear, coherent utterances
- Rhetorical devices: using language effectively for persuasion, emphasis, and effect
- Genre awareness: adapting language for different purposes (explaining, persuading, narrating)

The linguistic strand connects directly to the English curriculum while also drawing on subject-specific language across the curriculum.

**Cognitive Strand**

This strand addresses the thinking that underlies effective communication:
- Content: knowledge and understanding relevant to the topic
- Reasoning: providing explanations, evidence, and justifications
- Structuring: organising ideas coherently and signposting clearly
- Clarifying and summarising: making ideas accessible to others

The cognitive strand is where talk most directly supports learning, as pupils articulate, develop, and refine their thinking.

**Social and Emotional Strand**

This strand encompasses the interpersonal dimensions of talk:
- Listening: active, attentive engagement with others
- Turn-taking: managing the flow of conversation
- Empathy and rapport: building positive relationships through talk
- Confidence: developing self-assurance in communication

The social and emotional strand recognises that effective communication requires emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills alongside technical competence.

### Assessing Oracy

The Voice 21 framework includes assessment tools that evaluate pupil performance across the four strands. Assessment can be formative (ongoing, supporting development) or summative (providing information about achievement). Key principles for assessing oracy include:

- Assessing talk in authentic contexts rather than artificial performances
- Using clear criteria that are shared with pupils
- Involving pupils in self-assessment and peer assessment
- Focusing on progress over time rather than one-off performances

## Types of Talk in the Classroom

Effective oracy education involves deliberately staging different types of talk for different educational purposes. Understanding the purposes and characteristics of different talk types enables teachers to make informed pedagogical decisions.

### Exploratory Talk

As discussed above, exploratory talk is talk for thinking and learning. It is characterised by openness, questioning, and the collaborative development of ideas. Exploratory talk is essential for:

- Developing understanding of new concepts
- Problem-solving and reasoning
- Generating and evaluating ideas
- Clarifying thinking

**Teaching Exploratory Talk**

To develop exploratory talk, teachers should:
- Establish ground rules that encourage questioning, reasoning, and joint consideration
- Model exploratory talk through think-alouds and teacher demonstration
- Use "talk prompts" that scaffold exploratory engagement ("What makes you think that?", "Can you give an example?", "What alternative explanations might there be?")
- Provide sufficient time for genuine exploration rather than rushing to conclusions
- Create safe classroom cultures where uncertainty and partial understanding can be expressed

### Presentational Talk

Presentational talk involves communicating to an audience with clarity, confidence, and appropriate structure. Unlike exploratory talk, presentational talk involves polished, rehearsed communication of established ideas. Presentational talk is important for:

- Developing confidence in formal communication
- Learning to structure ideas for an audience
- Building audience awareness and adapting communication accordingly
- Preparing pupils for real-world communication demands

**Teaching Presentational Talk**

Effective presentational talk instruction involves:
- Providing models of effective presentation (both teacher and recorded examples)
- Teaching explicit structures for different presentation types
- Scaffolding preparation (planning templates, rehearsal opportunities)
- Building gradually from small, low-stakes presentations to larger, more formal occasions
- Teaching specific techniques for managing nerves and projecting confidence

### Dialogic Teaching

Dialogic teaching, as conceptualised by Robin Alexander and developed by Neil Mercer, involves teachers using talk strategically to engage pupils in sustained dialogue that advances learning. Key features include:

- Questions that extend thinking rather than merely testing recall
- Contributions that build on and develop pupils' responses
- Genuine exchange of ideas between teacher and pupils
- Structuring of classroom talk to ensure broad participation

Dialogic teaching moves beyond the traditional Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) pattern toward more extended, intellectually productive exchanges.

### Debate and Argumentation

Formal debate provides a structured context for developing argumentation skills. Debate requires pupils to:

- Construct logical arguments supported by evidence
- Anticipate and respond to counter-arguments
- Listen carefully to opposing views
- Use rhetorical strategies effectively
- Accept that reasonable people can disagree

**Teaching Debate**

Effective debate instruction involves:
- Teaching the formal structures of debate (proposition, opposition, rebuttal, etc.)
- Scaffolding argument construction (claim-evidence-reasoning frameworks)
- Establishing clear rules for respectful disagreement
- Starting with informal, low-stakes discussions before moving to formal debates
- Emphasising that the goal is reasoned discussion rather than winning at all costs

## Drama Conventions for Oracy Development

Drama provides powerful tools for developing oracy, offering structured contexts for speaking and listening that are both purposeful and engaging. Dorothy Heathcote's work on Mantle of the Expert and process drama has been particularly influential.

### Mantle of the Expert

Mantle of the Expert is a dramatic inquiry approach in which pupils take on the role of experts responsible for solving a problem or completing a commission. The teacher manages the fictional context while pupils work within it, drawing on and developing their knowledge while engaging in purposeful talk.

**Key Features**

- **Fictional context**: Learning is situated within a meaningful fictional scenario (e.g., a team of archaeologists excavating a site, a committee planning a new park)
- **Expert framing**: Pupils are positioned as capable, knowledgeable experts, which builds confidence and generates purposeful talk
- **Client or commission**: The fictional context typically involves a client who needs the experts' help, creating genuine purpose for communication
- **Teacher in role**: The teacher participates in the drama, sometimes managing from outside, sometimes taking roles within the fiction

**Oracy Benefits**

Mantle of the Expert develops oracy by:
- Providing authentic purposes for talk
- Positioning pupils as competent communicators
- Requiring explanation, discussion, and collaborative decision-making
- Building vocabulary and register appropriate to the expert context

### Process Drama Conventions

Process drama uses a range of conventions to structure dramatic experience and generate purposeful talk:

**Teacher in Role**

The teacher adopts a role within the drama, creating opportunities for pupils to engage in dialogue with a character who has particular knowledge, attitudes, or needs. This can involve questioning an eyewitness, interviewing an expert, or challenging a decision-maker.

**Hot-Seating**

A pupil (or the teacher) takes on the role of a character and answers questions from the class. Hot-seating develops questioning skills, empathy, and the ability to maintain a consistent perspective.

**Thought-Tracking**

The drama is paused to explore characters' inner thoughts and feelings. This can be done verbally (pupils speak their characters' thoughts) or through writing/drawing. Thought-tracking develops metacognitive awareness and emotional vocabulary.

**Conscience Alley**

Pupils line up in two rows to represent opposing views on a dilemma. A character walks between them, hearing arguments from both sides. This develops persuasive language and empathetic consideration of multiple perspectives.

**Freeze Frames and Tableaux**

Groups create frozen images representing moments, relationships, or concepts. When "brought to life," these can generate dialogue or narration. Tableaux develop visual literacy and collaborative decision-making.

**Soundscape and Voice Collage**

Groups create soundscapes representing environments, emotions, or events. These can be debriefed through discussion or used to generate descriptive language.

**Forum Theatre**

A scene is presented, then replayed with audience members able to stop the action and suggest or demonstrate alternatives. This develops critical evaluation and creative problem-solving through talk.

## Oracy Across the Curriculum

While oracy is most obviously connected to English, effective oracy education extends across all curriculum areas. Each subject has its own oracy demands and opportunities.

### Mathematics

Mathematical oracy involves:
- Explaining reasoning and problem-solving strategies
- Using precise mathematical vocabulary
- Constructing and critiquing mathematical arguments
- Collaborative problem-solving through talk

**Strategies**
- "Convince me" activities where pupils must justify mathematical claims
- Talk partners for discussing problem-solving approaches
- Whole-class discussion of solution strategies
- Mathematical vocabulary explicitly taught and practised through talk

### Science

Scientific oracy involves:
- Discussing observations and forming hypotheses
- Explaining scientific concepts and processes
- Evaluating evidence and constructing arguments
- Collaborative investigation and inquiry

**Strategies**
- Discussion of scientific phenomena before formal explanation
- Collaborative planning of investigations
- Presenting findings to peers
- Structured scientific argumentation

### Humanities

Oracy in history, geography, and religious studies involves:
- Discussing and evaluating sources and evidence
- Constructing and defending interpretations
- Exploring diverse perspectives and ethical issues
- Collaborative research and presentation

**Strategies**
- Source analysis through structured discussion
- Debates on historical or ethical questions
- Role-play and simulation activities
- Collaborative research projects with oral presentation

## Implementing Oracy: Practical Strategies for Teachers

### Establishing Ground Rules for Talk

Clear ground rules provide the foundation for productive classroom talk. These should be developed collaboratively with pupils and explicitly taught. Example ground rules for exploratory talk include:

- Everyone listens carefully to others
- Everyone is encouraged to contribute
- Questions are welcomed and respected
- Reasons are given for statements
- Alternatives are discussed before decisions are made
- Everyone is prepared to accept challenges and change their mind

### Using Talk Partners and Group Structures

Different talk structures serve different purposes:

**Think-Pair-Share**
Pupils think individually, discuss with a partner, then share with the wider group. This ensures broad participation and gives pupils time to formulate ideas before public sharing.

**Talk Partners**
Regular, assigned talk partners provide a safe context for trying out ideas. Partners can be matched or mixed by ability, language background, or other factors depending on purpose.

**Triads**
Groups of three allow for more complex interaction than pairs while still ensuring all can participate. Triads can be structured with specific roles (e.g., speaker, questioner, summariser).

**Structured Group Discussion**
Larger groups require more explicit structure to ensure equitable participation. Strategies include round-robins, talking tokens, or assigned roles.

### Scaffolding Talk

Sentence stems and talk frames provide scaffolding that helps pupils participate in sophisticated discussion:

**For Exploratory Talk**
- "I think... because..."
- "I agree with X, and I'd add..."
- "I see it differently because..."
- "An example of this is..."
- "Could you explain what you mean by...?"

**For Presentational Talk**
- "There are three main points..."
- "This is important because..."
- "To illustrate this..."
- "In conclusion..."

**For Argumentation**
- "The evidence suggests..."
- "One counter-argument is..."
- "However, this overlooks..."
- "On balance, I believe..."

### Creating Oracy-Rich Classroom Environments

Beyond specific activities, oracy development requires classroom cultures that value and support talk:

- **Time for talk**: Build in sufficient time for genuine discussion rather than rushing through material
- **Physical environment**: Arrange furniture to facilitate face-to-face interaction
- **Inclusive participation**: Use strategies to ensure all pupils participate, not just the most confident
- **Valuing talk**: Model interest in pupils' ideas and explicitly value spoken contributions
- **Safe spaces**: Create environments where pupils feel safe to express partial understanding, change their minds, and take risks

## Progression in Oracy Across Key Stages

### Early Years Foundation Stage (Ages 3-5)

In the EYFS, oracy is the primary mode of learning and communication. The focus is on:

**Listening and Attention**
- Listening to stories and responding
- Following increasingly complex instructions
- Sustaining attention during group activities

**Understanding**
- Following instructions involving several ideas or actions
- Understanding questions and responding appropriately
- Making sense of longer explanations and narratives

**Speaking**
- Extending vocabulary through experience and talk
- Using language to imagine and recreate roles and experiences
- Building longer, more complex sentences

**Social Interaction**
- Initiating and joining in conversations
- Taking turns in talk
- Adjusting talk to different listeners

**Teaching Approaches**
- Rich, language-rich environment with extensive adult-child interaction
- Storytelling and role-play as central activities
- Circle time and small group discussions
- Modelling and extending children's language

### Key Stage 1 (Ages 5-7)

At KS1, the foundations of formal oracy are established while maintaining the exploratory, play-based approach of the EYFS.

**Developing Skills**
- Articulating ideas clearly and audibly
- Beginning to organise thoughts for simple presentations
- Participating in collaborative discussions
- Listening and responding appropriately to others

**Curriculum Expectations**
The National Curriculum for English at KS1 requires pupils to:
- Listen and respond appropriately to adults and peers
- Ask relevant questions to extend understanding and knowledge
- Articulate and justify answers, arguments, and opinions
- Use spoken language to develop understanding through speculating, hypothesising, imagining, and exploring ideas
- Participate in discussions, presentations, performances, role-play, improvisations, and debates

**Teaching Approaches**
- Circle time for social and emotional development
- Show and tell with structured questioning
- Simple debates on age-appropriate issues
- Role-play and drama activities
- Collaborative storytelling and story mapping

### Key Stage 2 (Ages 7-11)

At KS2, pupils develop greater sophistication in their spoken language use, with increasing formal demands.

**Developing Skills**
- Presenting to audiences with growing confidence and structure
- Engaging in more sustained collaborative discussion
- Using spoken language to explore and develop ideas in depth
- Beginning to adapt register for different purposes and audiences

**Curriculum Expectations**
The National Curriculum for English at KS2 builds on KS1 foundations, with expectations for:
- Greater depth in discussion and presentation
- More formal debate and argumentation
- Use of standard English where appropriate
- Consideration of audience and purpose in spoken communication

**Teaching Approaches**
- Formal presentations with preparation and rehearsal
- Structured debates on curriculum-related topics
- Collaborative projects with oral reporting
- Drama and role-play across the curriculum
- Explicit teaching of discussion skills and ground rules

### Key Stage 3 (Ages 11-14)

KS3 sees pupils developing increasing independence and sophistication in their oracy, preparing for the demands of GCSE.

**Developing Skills**
- Sustained, structured presentations
- Sophisticated argumentation and debate
- Collaborative work with complex tasks

**Developing Skills**
- Polished, confident presentations
- Sophisticated argumentation and rhetorical awareness
- Independent organisation and management of group work
- Strategic adaptation of communication for maximum effect

**GCSE Assessment**
GCSE English Language includes a spoken language endorsement, requiring pupils to:
- Demonstrate presentation skills in a formal setting
- Use spoken standard English effectively
- Listen and respond to questions and feedback

While the endorsement is reported separately and does not contribute to the 9-1 grade, preparation for it provides valuable oracy development opportunities.

**Teaching Approaches**
- Formal presentations with rigorous preparation
- Competitive and collaborative debate
- Speaking and listening for real purposes and audiences beyond the classroom
- Explicit analysis of rhetorical techniques

## Common Misconceptions about Oracy

### Misconception 1: "Oracy is just speaking and listening by another name"

**The issue**: Oracy is sometimes dismissed as a rebranding of existing speaking and listening provision.

**The reality**: While oracy encompasses speaking and listening, it represents a more comprehensive, evidence-informed approach that integrates learning to talk with learning through talk. It involves deliberate, structured pedagogy rather than merely providing opportunities for talk.

### Misconception 2: "Oracy takes time away from 'real' learning"

**The issue**: Some teachers view talk-based activities as luxuries that detract from covering curriculum content.

**The reality**: Research demonstrates that well-structured talk enhances learning rather than detracting from it. Through talk, pupils process, articulate, and deepen their understanding of content. Oracy is not an add-on but a fundamental pedagogy.

### Misconception 3: "Oracy only benefits confident pupils"

**The issue**: Teachers may worry that oracy activities privilege already-confident speakers while leaving shy pupils behind.

**The reality**: High-quality oracy education benefits all pupils, including those who are initially less confident. Structured approaches with appropriate scaffolding ensure inclusive participation. Indeed, pupils who struggle with writing often find that oracy provides an alternative route to demonstrating and developing understanding.

### Misconception 4: "We already do oracy"

**The issue**: Schools may assume that because pupils talk in lessons, they are already providing oracy education.

**The reality**: While pupils inevitably talk, high-quality oracy education requires deliberate planning, explicit teaching of skills, and structured opportunities for development. Not all classroom talk is equally valuable for learning.

## Assessment and Monitoring Oracy

### Formative Assessment

Formative assessment of oracy involves ongoing observation and feedback that supports development:

- **Observation**: Teachers observe pupil talk during lessons, noting strengths and areas for development
- **Targeted feedback**: Specific, actionable feedback on oracy skills
- **Self-assessment**: Pupils reflect on their own oracy using clear criteria
- **Peer assessment**: Structured peer observation and feedback

### Summative Assessment

Summative assessment provides information about attainment:

- **Recorded presentations**: Audio or video recording of presentations for assessment
- **Discussion assessment**: Structured observation of group discussions
- **Portfolio approaches**: Collections of oral work demonstrating progress

### Using the Voice 21 Assessment Framework

The Voice 21 framework provides detailed assessment criteria across the four strands (physical, linguistic, cognitive, social and emotional). These can be used to:
- Identify starting points and track progress
- Set targets for development
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of oracy skills
- Moderate assessment across teachers and schools

## Conclusion: A Call to Action for Oracy

The evidence for oracy is compelling. Talk is not merely a medium for transmitting learning but is fundamental to learning itself. Pupils who develop strong oracy skills achieve better academically, enjoy enhanced life chances, and are better prepared for democratic citizenship.

Yet oracy remains underdeveloped in many schools. Implementing high-quality oracy education requires:

1. **Leadership commitment**: School leaders recognising oracy as a priority and resourcing it appropriately

2. **Professional development**: Teachers equipped with the knowledge and skills to implement oracy-rich pedagogy

3. **Deliberate planning**: Oracy embedded in curriculum planning rather than left to chance

4. **Inclusive practice**: Ensuring all pupils, regardless of background or confidence, benefit from oracy education

5. **Assessment**: Systems for monitoring and recognising oracy development

As Neil Mercer argues, oracy is not an educational luxury but a fundamental entitlement. Every pupil deserves the opportunity to develop their voice—to learn through talk and to learn to talk. In prioritising oracy, schools invest not only in academic achievement but in the communication skills, confidence, and democratic participation that will serve pupils throughout their lives.

The frameworks and strategies outlined in this knowledge file provide a foundation for this work. What remains is the commitment to implementation—the daily decisions teachers make to prioritise talk, structure it effectively, and ensure that every pupil finds their voice.
