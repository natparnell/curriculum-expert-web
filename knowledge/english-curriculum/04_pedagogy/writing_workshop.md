# Writing Workshop: Approaches to Teaching Writing

## Overview

The writing workshop represents a fundamental organisational structure for teaching writing in English classrooms across the primary and secondary phases. Moving beyond discrete composition lessons, the writing workshop establishes sustained, regular time for pupils to engage authentically with the writing process—planning, drafting, revising, editing, and publishing their work. This approach reflects professional writers' practices while providing structured support appropriate to developing writers at different stages.

Contemporary writing instruction in UK schools draws upon multiple complementary traditions: the process writing movement emanating from North American composition studies, the genre-based approaches informed by Systemic Functional Linguistics, and the Talk for Writing framework developed by Pie Corbett and Julia Strong. Understanding these traditions—and how teachers synthesise them in classroom practice—equips educators to design writing curricula that develop both technical competence and creative confidence.

## The Writing Process

### Understanding Process Writing

The process writing movement, emerging prominently in the 1970s–80s through the work of Donald Graves, Donald Murray, and others at the University of New Hampshire, fundamentally reconceptualised writing instruction. Rather than treating writing as the production of correct texts, process writing positioned composition as a recursive, exploratory activity involving multiple stages.

The classic process writing sequence comprises:

**Prewriting/Planning**: Generating ideas, gathering information, considering audience and purpose, and making organisational decisions. For young writers, this might involve discussion, drawing, or story mapping; for older pupils, research, outlining, or freewriting.

**Drafting**: Getting ideas down on paper without excessive concern for correctness. The emphasis on fluency over accuracy at this stage liberates writers from premature self-censorship that can inhibit composition.

**Revising**: Making substantial changes to content, organisation, and style. Revision addresses the big picture—whether the writing achieves its purpose, engages its audience, and presents ideas coherently—rather than surface corrections.

**Editing**: Addressing conventions—spelling, punctuation, grammar, and handwriting—once content and structure are established. Editing prepares writing for public reading.

**Publishing**: Sharing finished work with audiences beyond the teacher, whether through display, performance, publication, or digital sharing.

### Process Writing in the UK Context

While the process writing movement originated in North American higher education, its principles profoundly influenced UK primary practice through the National Writing Project (1985–88) and subsequent National Literacy Strategy. The Primary Framework for Literacy and Mathematics (2006) embedded process elements within its teaching sequences, though with greater attention to genre features than the original process writing advocates typically emphasised.

The Department for Education's statutory programmes of study (2014) require pupils to "plan, draft, evaluate, revise, and proof-read" their writing, encoding process writing principles within national curriculum requirements. Teachers must translate these statutory requirements into classroom practices appropriate to their pupils' developmental stages.

## Modelled Writing

### The Teacher as Writer

Modelled writing involves the teacher composing text aloud in front of pupils, articulating the thinking processes that guide writing decisions. As Andy Tharby observes in *Making Every English Lesson Count*, modelling "holds a microscope to the mysterious, private experience of a writer who is transforming thoughts into words."

Effective modelled writing makes visible:

**Decision-making processes**: Why choose this word rather than that? Why construct the sentence this way? Why organise ideas in this sequence?

**Metacognitive strategies**: How do writers overcome blocks? How do they monitor whether their writing achieves intended effects?

**Technical expertise in action**: How do spelling patterns, grammatical structures, and punctuation conventions operate within authentic composition?

**The experience of writing as hard work**: Modelling normalises struggle, false starts, and revision as inherent to writing, countering pupils' assumption that competent writers produce perfect first drafts.

### Structuring Modelled Writing Sessions

Research from the Chartered College of Teaching suggests that effective modelled writing requires careful planning to ensure metacognitive processes are made explicit rather than assumed. Teachers should:

**Prepare thoroughly**: While modelling should appear spontaneous, effective demonstration requires advance planning of what to make explicit. Teachers might script the thinking they will articulate alongside the text they will produce.

**Position pupils as observers**: Ensure all pupils can see the writing surface clearly and establish expectations for focused observation. Some teachers use "writer's glasses" or similar devices to signal when pupils should watch particularly carefully.

**Think aloud continuously**: Verbalise internal dialogue—"I'm not sure how to start this paragraph... perhaps I could... no, that doesn't work because..."—demonstrating that writing involves constant decision-making.

**Build in brief engagement points**: Short pause points where pupils discuss options with partners or suggest vocabulary prevent passive observation and maintain attention.

**Create artefacts for reference**: Display modelled texts for later consultation; some teachers create "writing toolkits" from modelled examples that pupils reference during independent work.

## Shared Writing

### Collaborative Composition

Shared writing moves from teacher demonstration to collaborative composition. The teacher still holds the pen (or controls the keyboard), but pupils contribute ideas, vocabulary, and structural suggestions. This scaffolded approach supports pupils in producing text beyond their independent capabilities while making the composition process visible and discussable.

The Primary English Education Consultancy distinguishes modelled and shared writing helpfully: modelled writing is "writing in front of children" while shared writing is "writing with children." The teacher relinquishes some "pen power" to enable pupil contributions while maintaining guidance over the overall direction.

### Functions of Shared Writing

Shared writing serves multiple pedagogical purposes:

**Bridging from modelling to independence**: Pupils contribute ideas within a teacher-supported structure, developing confidence before facing blank pages independently.

**Making writing discussable**: Because the text belongs to the collective, pupils can critique and refine it without personal vulnerability. The shared text becomes a site for investigating writing decisions.

**Differentiated support**: Teachers can direct specific questions to individual pupils based on their needs—asking one child to suggest an adjective while requesting a complex sentence from another.

**Addressing common difficulties**: When multiple pupils struggle with similar challenges, shared writing allows the teacher to address these explicitly within authentic composition contexts.

**Generating success criteria**: The shared text, once complete, provides material for identifying what makes effective writing in the genre being studied. Pupils can articulate quality indicators they then apply to their own work.

### Technical Considerations

Effective shared writing requires classroom management strategies that enable participation while maintaining focus:

**Clear participation protocols**: Establish how pupils offer contributions—raised hands, think-pair-share sequences, or teacher nomination—tailored to the activity's purpose.

**Recording pupil contributions faithfully**: Write exactly what pupils suggest (even if awkward) to validate their participation, then discuss improvements collaboratively.

**Maintaining compositional momentum**: Balance thorough discussion with forward movement; shared writing sessions can bog down in excessive deliberation.

**Creating distance for evaluation**: Periodically step back from the shared text to read it aloud and evaluate its effectiveness, modelling the self-assessment writers must eventually internalise.

## Talk for Writing

### Origins and Principles

Talk for Writing (TfW), developed by Pie Corbett and Julia Strong, represents the most influential writing pedagogy in contemporary UK primary education. Based on observations of how children learn language, TfW recognises that oral rehearsal precedes and supports written composition. The approach is founded on three fundamental principles:

**Imitation**: Children learn to write by imitating models—internalising patterns, structures, and vocabulary from quality texts before attempting independent variation.

**Innovation**: Once patterns are internalised, children adapt and innovate, making changes to content while maintaining structural frameworks.

**Invention**: Finally, children apply learned patterns creatively to generate original compositions.

This progression—from imitation through innovation to invention—structures TfW units and provides a developmental trajectory for writing development.

### The Three Phases of Talk for Writing

**Phase One: Imitation**

The imitation phase establishes deep familiarity with a model text through multiple engagement strategies:

- **Text mapping**: Creating visual representations (story maps, text maps) that capture the text's structure and key content without demanding reading fluency
- **Actions and rehearsal**: Embodying texts through physical actions and repetitive oral rehearsal until pupils can "perform" texts fluently
- **Text analysis**: Identifying underlying patterns, language features, and organisational structures—the "toolkit" that makes the text effective

Corbett emphasises that pupils should know texts "by heart" before attempting writing. This internalisation provides the linguistic resource base from which independent composition draws.

**Phase Two: Innovation**

The innovation phase supports pupils in adapting the model text:

- **Substitution**: Changing characters, settings, or objects while maintaining the same structure
- **Addition**: Inserting extra elements—additional description, dialogue, or events
- **Alteration**: Modifying elements—changing endings, shifting viewpoints, adjusting settings
- **Retaining**: Keeping elements that work well

Teachers create "boxing up" grids that visualise the model text's structure, enabling pupils to plan innovations systematically.

**Phase Three: Invention**

The invention phase involves applying learned patterns to new contexts:

- Drawing on the toolkit developed through text analysis
- Using structural patterns flexibly for new purposes
- Making independent decisions about content, organisation, and style

### Critiques and Considerations

While Talk for Writing enjoys widespread adoption, educators should consider potential limitations:

**Genre range**: TfW works most straightforwardly with narrative and predictable non-fiction structures (instructions, recounts). More complex genres—argumentation, nuanced exposition—may require additional approaches.

**Creativity concerns**: Critics argue excessive focus on imitation may constrain individual voice. Proponents counter that internalised patterns provide resources for creative expression rather than restricting it.

**Secondary transition**: TfW is primarily a primary pedagogy. Secondary teachers must consider how to build upon pupils' TfW experiences while developing more sophisticated compositional independence.

## Genre-Based Approaches

### Theoretical Foundations

Genre-based pedagogy, drawing upon Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) developed by Michael Halliday and educational linguists including Jim Martin and Joan Rothery in Australia, approaches writing as social action. Genres represent "socially recognised ways of using language in response to recurring communicative situations"—text types that have evolved to achieve specific purposes within particular contexts.

Unlike purely process-oriented approaches that focus on individual expression, genre pedagogy emphasises that effective writing requires understanding how text types function socially. To write effectively, pupils must control the linguistic features that characterise different genres.

### Genre Teaching and Learning Cycle

The Australian genre-based teaching and learning cycle, influential in UK practice particularly through the National Literacy Strategy, comprises four stages:

**Building the field**: Developing subject knowledge and vocabulary relevant to the writing topic. This might involve reading, research, discussion, or experience.

**Modelling and deconstruction**: Analysing exemplar texts to identify how particular genres achieve their purposes. Teachers guide pupils in identifying structural patterns and language features—the "genre toolkit."

**Joint construction**: Teacher and pupils collaboratively compose texts in the target genre, with the teacher scaffolding decisions about content and form.

**Independent construction**: Pupils write independently, applying learned genre knowledge to new contexts.

### Key Genres in the Primary Curriculum

The National Literacy Strategy Framework for Teaching (1998) and subsequent guidance identified key genres for primary writing instruction:

**Recounts**: Retelling events in chronological sequence. Language features include past tense, temporal connectives (first, then, next, finally), and personal pronouns.

**Instructions**: Directing actions through imperative verbs, sequenced steps, and second-person address. Organisation features numbered or bulleted sequences and clarity of expression.

**Explanations**: Explaining processes or phenomena through causal connectives, present tense, and logical sequencing. Often employ diagrams or flow charts.

**Persuasion**: Influencing opinions or actions through rhetorical questions, emotive language, conditional structures, and evidence presentation.

**Discussion**: Exploring multiple perspectives through balanced presentation of arguments, contrastive connectives, and evaluative conclusions.

**Non-chronological reports**: Presenting factual information through generalised participants, present tense, and organised paragraphing with subheadings.

### Grammar in Context

A distinctive contribution of genre-based approaches is attention to grammar as meaning-making resource rather than arbitrary rule system. SFL identifies three "metafunctions" of language that teachers can make explicit to developing writers:

**Ideational function**: How language represents experience—processes (verbs), participants (nouns), and circumstances (adverbials).

**Interpersonal function**: How language enacts social relationships—modality (degrees of certainty and obligation), evaluation (attitudes expressed), and mood (statements, questions, commands).

**Textual function**: How language creates coherent texts—theme/rheme organisation (how information flows), cohesion (connecting devices), and text structure (generic stages).

Making these dimensions explicit enables pupils to make informed choices about how their writing achieves intended effects.

## Editing and Redrafting

### Developing Revision Capabilities

The distinction between revision (making substantive changes to content and organisation) and editing (correcting surface features) proves crucial in writing instruction. Many pupils conflate the two, believing that "improving writing" means correcting spelling and punctuation while neglecting bigger-picture improvements.

**Teaching revision** requires:

- **Modelling the difference**: Demonstrating how writers make substantial changes—reordering paragraphs, deleting sections, adding elaboration, adjusting tone
- **Providing specific revision prompts**: "Add sensory detail to this paragraph" or "Experiment with beginning the story at a different point" rather than vague "improve your work"
- **Creating distance**: Time between drafting and revision enables more objective evaluation; peer reading provides external perspectives
- **Focusing on effects**: Asking "What do you want readers to feel/think/know here?" and "Does this achieve that?" rather than simply identifying errors

**Teaching editing** requires:

- **Delayed attention to conventions**: Ensuring editing follows substantial revision so pupils don't prematurely fixate on correctness
- **Systematic approaches**: COPS (Capitalisation, Organisation, Punctuation, Spelling) or similar frameworks that structure editing processes
- **Tools and references**: Providing dictionaries, spellcheckers, punctuation guides, and editing checklists that enable independent correction
- **Specific instruction**: Teaching spelling patterns, punctuation functions, and grammatical concepts explicitly so pupils have knowledge to apply

### Peer Response

Peer response, when structured effectively, provides authentic audience feedback while developing pupils' critical reading capabilities:

**Setting clear parameters**: Specify what peers should attend to—description effectiveness, clarity of instructions, persuasiveness of argument—rather than general evaluation.

**Training response protocols**: Teach pupils to offer specific, constructive comments ("I particularly liked... because..." or "I wondered about...") rather than vague praise or destructive criticism.

**Establishing safety**: Create classroom cultures where honest feedback supports rather than humiliates; some teachers use anonymous submission or focus on extract feedback before whole-text response.

**Teacher modelling**: Demonstrate how to respond constructively to writing, including how to raise concerns without discouraging the writer.

## Publishing Pupil Work

### The Purpose of Publication

Publishing—the sharing of finished writing with audiences beyond the teacher—provides essential motivation and authentic purpose for composition. When pupils know their work will be read by others, they attend more carefully to clarity, interest, and presentation.

Publication possibilities include:

**Classroom displays**: Creating visually appealing presentations that celebrate achievement and provide models for other pupils

**Class anthologies**: Compiling collections of writing that demonstrate collective achievement and can be shared with families

**Performance**: Reading aloud, assemblies, or recorded performances that bring writing to life through oral delivery

**School publications**: Newsletters, magazines, or websites that share pupil writing with the broader school community

**External publication**: Local newspapers, writing competitions, online platforms, or book creation services that provide authentic external audiences

**Digital sharing**: Blogs, podcasts, video presentations, or social media (where appropriate) that expand potential readership

### Developing Presentation Skills

Publication involves not merely producing text but presenting it effectively:

**Handwriting and word processing**: The statutory curriculum requires attention to legibility and, in upper key stage 2, word processing skills that enable professional presentation

**Layout and design**: Understanding how visual elements—headings, images, white space, font choices—support reading and create tone

**Performance skills**: For spoken publication, developing vocal variety, pacing, and audience awareness that brings written text to life

### Authentic Audiences

The most powerful publication provides genuine, responsive audiences:

- Writing shared with younger pupils who respond authentically
- Letters sent to real recipients (local councillors, authors, businesses) who may reply
- Writing posted online that attracts comments from unknown readers
- Performance before audiences whose reactions provide immediate feedback

Teachers should seek publication opportunities that connect pupil writing with real readers, recognising that writing is fundamentally a social act of communication.

## Organising the Writing Workshop

### Structure and Routine

The writing workshop requires organisational structures that support sustained, independent work while enabling teacher conferencing and peer collaboration:

**Mini-lessons (10–15 minutes)**: Brief, focused instruction addressing specific writing techniques, conventions, or processes relevant to current work

**Independent writing time (20–30 minutes)**: Pupils working on individual projects with teacher circulating to confer individually or with small groups

**Sharing/closing (5–10 minutes)**: Whole-class or small-group sharing of writing in progress, celebrating achievements and reinforcing workshop norms

### The Writing Environment

Effective writing workshops require:

**Access to resources**: Dictionaries, thesauruses, word walls, genre toolkits, and reference materials readily available

**Flexible organisation**: Furniture arrangements that enable both independent concentration and peer collaboration as needed

**Display of process**: Visual reminders of writing process stages, genre features, and quality criteria that support independent decision-making

**Time**: Regular, protected time for writing—daily where possible—rather than sporadic composition lessons

### Teacher Conferencing

Individual or small-group conferences provide differentiated instruction within the workshop structure:

**Research phase**: Observing or reading to understand what the writer is attempting and where they might need support

**Decide phase**: Identifying the most important teaching point based on research—what will most help this writer progress?

**Compliment phase**: Opening with specific, genuine praise that names what the writer is doing well, reinforcing effective strategies

**Teach phase**: Explicit instruction addressing the identified need—modelling a technique, explaining a concept, or demonstrating a revision strategy

**Coach phase**: Supporting the pupil in applying the teaching point immediately to their own writing, with scaffolding gradually reduced

**Link phase**: Connecting the conference learning to ongoing work, establishing next steps the pupil can pursue independently

Conferences typically last 3–5 minutes, enabling teachers to meet with multiple pupils during independent writing time.

## Progression Across Key Stages

### Key Stage 1 Foundations

At Key Stage 1, writing workshop principles manifest through:

**Oral rehearsal emphasis**: Extensive talk before writing, with pupils articulating sentences aloud before attempting transcription

**Heavy scaffolding**: Modelled and shared writing predominating over independent composition, with pupils gradually taking on more control

**Transcription focus**: Developing handwriting fluency and spelling knowledge alongside composition, recognising that mechanical demands constrain young writers

**Short, frequent sessions**: Brief writing periods that match young children's concentration spans, with multiple opportunities to complete pieces

The National Curriculum requires pupils to "write sentences by sequencing sounds to words" and compose short narratives and non-fiction texts, providing foundations for more extended composition in Key Stage 2.

### Key Stage 2 Development

Key Stage 2 writing workshops develop greater independence and sophistication:

**Extended composition**: Longer writing sessions producing more substantial texts, with pupils managing the writing process with decreasing scaffolding

**Genre knowledge**: Explicit teaching of increasingly complex genre structures and language features, building pupils' repertoire of text types

**Revision emphasis**: Moving beyond first-draft writing to genuine redrafting, with pupils learning to evaluate and improve their work substantially

**Audience awareness**: Greater attention to writing for specific purposes and audiences, with publication providing authentic motivation

By the end of Key Stage 2, pupils should write effectively across multiple genres, selecting appropriate forms and drawing independently on reading as models.

### Secondary Transition

Secondary English teachers inherit pupils with varying writing workshop experiences:

**Building on primary foundations**: Recognising and valuing the genre knowledge and process understanding pupils bring from Key Stage 2

**Developing disciplinary writing**: Moving beyond general narrative and non-fiction toward subject-specific writing—literary analysis, persuasive argument, technical exposition

**Increasing independence**: Reducing scaffolding as pupils internalise writing processes and genre knowledge

**Digital composition**: Incorporating word processing, digital media, and multimodal composition into writing workshop structures

### Common Pupil Misconceptions

Teachers should anticipate and address recurring misconceptions about writing:

**The perfect first draft**: Many pupils believe good writers produce polished text immediately, leading to anxiety about mistakes. Modelling that demonstrates revision and editing as normal practice counters this.

**Writing equals handwriting**: Pupils may conflate the physical act of writing with composition itself, limiting their conceptualisation of what writing involves.

**Correctness over communication**: Premature focus on spelling and punctuation can inhibit composition. Pupils need explicit permission to prioritise ideas during drafting.

**One approach fits all**: Pupils may expect uniform writing processes rather than recognising that different tasks require different approaches—planning extensively for some pieces, discovering through drafting for others.

**Teacher as only audience**: Pupils who see writing as exclusively for teacher evaluation miss the communicative purposes that motivate authentic composition.

## Assessment and Progress Monitoring

### Formative Assessment in the Writing Workshop

Ongoing assessment embedded within writing workshop routines:

**Conferring notes**: Teachers maintain records of individual conference content, tracking development over time and identifying patterns across the class

**Writing samples**: Regular collection of work in progress and finished pieces provides evidence of growth and identifies instructional needs

**Pupil self-assessment**: Rubrics, checklists, and reflection prompts that develop pupils' evaluative capabilities and metacognitive awareness

**Peer feedback quality**: Observing how pupils respond to each other's writing reveals their developing understanding of writing quality

### Summative Assessment

While the writing workshop emphasises process, summative assessment remains necessary:

**Portfolio assessment**: Collections of writing across genres and time periods demonstrate range and development more effectively than single samples

**Moderation processes**: Collaborative assessment with colleagues ensures consistent standards and professional development

**External benchmarks**: Reference to national standards (Teacher Assessment Frameworks, GCSE criteria) maintains alignment with expected outcomes

## Conclusion

The writing workshop synthesises multiple pedagogical traditions into coherent classroom practice that develops both technical competence and writerly identity. By making writing processes visible through modelling and shared composition, providing structured support through genre teaching, and motivating authentic engagement through publication, teachers create conditions where all pupils can develop as confident, capable writers.

The most effective writing instruction combines explicit teaching of genre knowledge and writing strategies with ample opportunity for independent application. Teachers must balance the scaffolded support that enables success with the gradual release that builds genuine independence. When writing workshops function well, pupils internalise not merely specific text types but the dispositions and strategies of writers who can navigate unfamiliar compositional challenges with confidence and skill.
