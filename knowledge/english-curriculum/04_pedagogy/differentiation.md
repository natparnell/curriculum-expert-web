# Differentiation and Adaptive Teaching in English

## Introduction: From Differentiation to Adaptive Teaching

The landscape of inclusive pedagogy in English teaching has undergone significant transformation over the past decade. Where once teachers were encouraged to plan multiple parallel activities for different ability groups within the same classroom, contemporary practice has shifted decisively toward **adaptive teaching**—an approach characterised by responsive, just-in-time adjustments to whole-class instruction rather than pre-planned differentiation.

As Matt Bromley (2025) articulates in *SecEd*, the distinction is profound: "It is the difference between teaching up to 30 different lessons at once—matching the pace and pitch to each individual learner and providing different tasks and resources to different learners—and teaching the same lesson to all 30 learners by 'teaching to the top' while providing scaffolds to those who need additional initial support in order to access the same ambitious curriculum and meet our high expectations."

The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF, 2022) has been instrumental in promoting this shift, defining adaptive teaching as "being responsive to information about learning, then adjusting teaching to better match pupil need." This represents a move away from the problematic practice of differentiating by outcome, where lower-attaining pupils were routinely given less demanding tasks that limited their progress and entrenched achievement gaps.

Ofsted's inspection framework now expects teachers to provide an ambitious curriculum for all pupils, including those with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) and those learning English as an additional language (EAL). The inspectorate has been critical of approaches that inadvertently lower expectations for certain groups, noting in a 2013 report on the most able that successful schools "established clear expectations that high-attaining students would achieve their goals, for example by ensuring that the most able students were given challenging and stretching targets."

This knowledge file explores the practical application of adaptive teaching principles in English, examining evidence-based strategies for scaffolding reading and writing, supporting SEND and EAL learners, pre-teaching vocabulary, and providing stretch and challenge for high attainers.

## Theoretical Foundations: Vygotsky and Bruner

### The Zone of Proximal Development

At the heart of adaptive teaching lies Lev Vygotsky's concept of the **Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)**—the gap between what a learner can do independently and what they can achieve with guidance from a more knowledgeable other. In the English classroom, this translates to teaching at the upper edge of pupils' capabilities while providing the support structures necessary for success.

Vygotsky's work emphasises the social nature of learning. In English, this means that talk—structured discussion, collaborative analysis, and peer interaction—is not merely a classroom management tool but a fundamental mechanism for developing understanding. The skilled English teacher creates opportunities for pupils to rehearse ideas orally before committing them to writing, to debate interpretations before analysing independently, and to work alongside peers who model sophisticated language use.

### Bruner's Scaffolding

Jerome Bruner's concept of **scaffolding** extends Vygotsky's ideas into practical classroom application. Where Vygotsky emphasised social interaction with a skilled partner, Bruner focused on how tasks themselves can be structured to support learning. As The Literacy Company (2024) explains, Bruner's approach involves "tasks being broken down into smaller or more manageable steps (resources, pictures, models, tasks broken into smaller chunks)."

Both theoretical traditions inform contemporary adaptive teaching. Effective English teachers combine social scaffolding (teacher modelling, guided practice, peer collaboration) with material scaffolding (writing frames, word banks, graphic organisers) to create multiple pathways to ambitious learning objectives.

## Scaffolding Reading in English

### Establishing a Comprehension Canopy

Before pupils encounter challenging texts, effective teachers establish what Wanzek (2021) terms a "**comprehension canopy**"—a framework that prepares learners to engage successfully with complex material. This canopy consists of three essential elements: establishing a purpose for reading, posing an overarching question that will guide comprehension, and priming relevant background knowledge.

In the English classroom, this might translate to:

- **Establishing purpose**: "Today we are reading this opening chapter not merely for enjoyment but to understand how the author establishes an atmosphere of unease through specific linguistic choices."
- **Overarching question**: "How does the writer manipulate our expectations through the way they introduce the setting?"
- **Background knowledge**: Brief exploration of Victorian London before reading *Oliver Twist*, or discussion of the context of the Civil Rights Movement before encountering *To Kill a Mockingbird*.

### The EEF Reading Comprehension Strategies

The Education Endowment Foundation's guidance on improving literacy identifies seven core comprehension strategies that should be explicitly taught and scaffolded:

1. **Prediction**: Encouraging pupils to anticipate what might happen next based on textual evidence
2. **Questioning**: Teaching pupils to generate questions before, during, and after reading
3. **Clarifying**: Developing the habit of identifying confusing elements and seeking resolution
4. **Summarising**: Distilling the essence of what has been read
5. **Inference**: Reading between the lines to understand implicit meanings
6. **Activating prior knowledge**: Connecting new texts to existing understanding
7. **Visualising**: Creating mental images from textual descriptions

These strategies are not innate; they must be modelled, practised with support, and applied independently. The gradual release of responsibility model—I do, we do, you do—provides a structure for this scaffolding.

### Tiered Texts Approach

For mixed-attainment classes, the **tiered texts approach** offers a powerful means of maintaining ambitious content while providing differentiated access. Rather than giving different pupils different texts, teachers provide the same complex text alongside supplementary materials at varying levels of difficulty that illuminate the same concepts.

In practice, this might involve:

- A challenging whole-class novel as the anchor text
- Accompanying non-fiction articles that provide context at different reading levels
- Extracts from critical essays that model analytical thinking, with some heavily scaffolded and others more demanding
- Visual materials (films, artworks, photographs) that convey thematic content without relying solely on linguistic decoding

### Directed Activities Related to Text (DARTs)

For pupils who struggle with reading comprehension, **Directed Activities Related to Text (DARTs)** provide structured ways of engaging with material without requiring fluent independent reading. These include:

- **Sorting activities**: Categorising quotations, events, or characters according to criteria
- **Matching tasks**: Connecting quotations to meanings, characters to descriptions, or events to consequences
- **Sequencing**: Reordering events from a text
- **Labelling**: Annotating diagrams or text extracts
- **Gap-filling**: Completing missing words in passages
- **Substitution tables**: Using provided structures to create sentences about the text

These activities, recommended by the Headteacher Update (2023) for supporting EAL learners, are equally valuable for pupils with reading difficulties or those new to the linguistic demands of secondary English.

## Scaffolding Writing in English

### Writing Frames and Sentence Starters

The blank page presents a formidable barrier for many pupils. **Writing frames** and **sentence starters** provide initial support that helps pupils begin the writing process without the cognitive burden of simultaneously generating content and formulating appropriate language structures.

The Teacher Toolkit's widely-used **sentence stems** technique "gives students the opportunity to respond in the form of a complete sentence to effectively communicate. Sentence stems provide scaffolding to help students get started in speaking or writing without the added pressure of thinking about how to correctly formulate a response."

Effective sentence starters in English might include:

**For analysis:**
- "The writer uses [technique] to suggest..."
- "This metaphor implies that..."
- "The connotations of [word] suggest..."
- "By describing [feature] as [adjective], the author creates a sense of..."

**For comparison:**
- "Whilst both writers address [theme], [Author A] focuses on... whereas [Author B] emphasises..."
- "A key similarity between the texts is..."
- "In contrast to [Text A], the presentation of [theme] in [Text B] suggests..."

**For evaluation:**
- "The most significant factor is... because..."
- "This interpretation is persuasive because..."
- "However, a limitation of this view is..."

The goal is always to fade these scaffolds over time, moving from heavily supported early attempts to independent, sophisticated writing.

### Word Banks and Vocabulary Support

Vocabulary-rich writing requires vocabulary-rich teaching. **Word banks**—co-constructed lists of useful vocabulary displayed in the classroom—provide pupils with the linguistic tools they need to express complex ideas.

As the Teaching Channel (2024) recommends, "Develop an interactive word wall before assigning the rough draft. This can be useful for assisting students with word finding and increasing their oral language and writing skills especially if they are involved in the co-creation of the word wall."

Effective word banks in English should:
- Be organised thematically rather than alphabetically
- Include tier 2 vocabulary (academic words like 'conveys', 'juxtaposition', 'evokes') alongside tier 3 subject-specific terminology
- Provide definitions and example sentences
- Be actively used, not merely decorative

### The Fading Scaffold Model

Research by The Literacy Architects (2025) emphasises that scaffolding must be temporary. Teachers should plan for the gradual removal of supports:

1. **Heavy scaffolding**: Writing frames with multiple sentence starters, word banks, modelled examples
2. **Medium scaffolding**: Fewer sentence starters, partially completed planning frames
3. **Light scaffolding**: Planning prompts, success criteria, checklists
4. **Independent writing**: Pupils apply learned structures without explicit scaffolds

The rate at which scaffolds are faded should be responsive to individual progress, not predetermined by the calendar.

## Supporting SEND Pupils in English

### Cognition and Learning Needs

Pupils with cognition and learning needs, including dyslexia and moderate learning difficulties, may require specific adaptations to access the English curriculum while maintaining appropriate challenge.

The Community Schools Trust (2023) identifies effective written scaffolds for these learners:

- **Class notes** that record key learning from discussion, providing a reference point for independent work
- **Word banks** that reduce the cognitive load of word retrieval
- **Writing frames** that provide structural support
- **Sentence starters** that model academic language patterns
- **Visual organisers** that help pupils sequence ideas before writing

### Processing Time and Instructions

Many pupils with SEND benefit from additional processing time. Adaptive teaching for these learners includes:

- Pausing after questions to allow thinking time before expecting responses
- Breaking complex instructions into sequential steps
- Providing written instructions alongside verbal explanations
- Checking understanding before releasing pupils to independent work

### Assistive Technology

The SEND Code of Practice (2015) emphasises the role of assistive technology in removing barriers to learning. In English, this might include:

- **Text-to-speech software** for pupils with reading difficulties
- **Speech-to-text tools** for those whose writing fluency is impaired
- **Predictive text** that supports vocabulary recall
- **Graphic organisers** in digital formats that can be manipulated and revised

However, technology should supplement, not replace, quality first teaching. The most effective use of assistive technology occurs when teachers explicitly teach pupils how to use these tools strategically.

## EAL Considerations in English

### The EAL Landscape

The term **English as an Additional Language (EAL)** encompasses pupils with diverse linguistic profiles: new arrivals with no English; pupils developing conversational fluency but struggling with academic language; and long-term EAL learners who may appear orally fluent but require continued support with the linguistic demands of written academic English.

The Bell Foundation (2025), a leading authority on EAL in UK schools, emphasises that "interventions for learners using EAL aimed at explicitly teaching academic and/or general vocabulary were particularly successful in terms of pupils' learning of the target vocabulary or in terms of wider literacy-based measures."

### Pre-Teaching Vocabulary

**Pre-teaching**—introducing key vocabulary before pupils encounter it in the main lesson—is one of the most effective strategies for supporting EAL learners. The British Council's TeachingEnglish resource explains that "In order to pre-teach vocabulary effectively, the teacher needs to identify what the learners already know and what might cause problems."

Effective pre-teaching involves:

1. **Identifying high-utility vocabulary**: Not every unfamiliar word warrants pre-teaching. Focus on tier 2 words that appear across academic contexts and are essential to understanding the specific text.

2. **Providing multiple exposures**: Research suggests pupils need 12-14 meaningful exposures to a new word before it becomes part of their productive vocabulary.

3. **Using visual supports**: Images, gestures, and real objects help create direct connections between words and meanings without translation.

4. **Exploring word morphology**: Breaking words into roots, prefixes, and suffixes helps pupils recognise patterns and make connections to other words they know.

5. **Creating opportunities for use**: Pre-taught words should be encountered and used in meaningful contexts shortly after introduction.

### Language-Rich Classrooms

As ClickView (2024) recommends, "Creating a language-rich environment in the classroom reinforces language learning. Teachers can label objects around the room in both English and learners' native language(s). Labelling students' drawings in both English and native languages also supports language learning."

Effective language-rich environments include:
- **Word walls** displaying current vocabulary with definitions and images
- **Bilingual resources** that validate pupils' home languages while developing English
- **Visual timelines** and story maps that support narrative comprehension
- **Sentence substitution tables** that show how grammatical structures work

### Seating and Grouping

High Speed Training (2022) advises that "So that your EAL students can better hear and see during the lesson, sit them near the front of the classroom. You could also consider who they are sitting next to. A native English speaker with high ability (i.e. one who uses a wide vocabulary and complex sentence structures) will be a good language role model for those learning English."

Strategic grouping can provide EAL learners with:
- Exposure to advanced language use
- Models of academic discourse
- Opportunities for collaborative learning in less intimidating contexts
- Structured talk partners who can clarify and extend understanding

### The Cummins Framework

Jim Cummins' theoretical framework distinguishes between:
- **Basic Interpersonal Communicative Skills (BICS)**: Conversational fluency that typically develops within 1-2 years
- **Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP)**: The abstract, decontextualised language of academic learning that may take 5-7 years to develop

Many pupils who appear fluent in social English continue to struggle with the linguistic demands of analysing literature or constructing academic arguments. Adaptive teaching for EAL learners recognises this distinction and continues to provide scaffolding even for orally fluent pupils.

## Stretch and Challenge for High Attainers

### Moving Beyond "More of the Same"

Ofsted's 2013 report on the most able noted that too often, high-attaining pupils were given "more of the same" rather than genuinely challenging work. True stretch and challenge requires not just additional quantity but increased cognitive demand.

As the National Association for Able Children in Education (NACE, 2024) emphasises, "Planning for stretch and challenge aims to move every learner beyond their comfort zone, no matter where that zone starts. Rather than focusing only on high achievers, a focus on stretch encourages teachers to set the right level of challenge for all."

### The "Pitch It Up" Approach

Alex Quigley (2025), writing for the Education Endowment Foundation, advises teachers to "pitch it up"—selecting challenging texts, setting audacious levels of challenge, and "eliminating any easy, gentle, simplified tasks that high attainers are not challenged by."

In English, this translates to:
- Selecting texts that demand sophisticated interpretation
- Setting questions that require evaluation and synthesis rather than mere retrieval
- Expecting extended analytical writing that draws connections across texts and contexts
- Providing access to critical scholarship and theoretical frameworks

### Depth Over Breadth

Rather than rushing high attainers through additional content, effective stretch and challenge emphasises **depth of engagement**. Strategies include:

- **Critical reading**: Introducing pupils to conflicting interpretations and asking them to evaluate evidence
- **Intertextual analysis**: Exploring how texts connect to broader literary traditions, cultural movements, and historical contexts
- **Creative response**: Asking pupils to write in the style of studied authors, demonstrating deep understanding of craft
- **Independent research**: Supporting pupils in pursuing lines of inquiry beyond the specified curriculum

### Metacognitive Challenge

High attainers benefit from explicit focus on **metacognition**—thinking about thinking. This includes:
- Reflecting on how they constructed interpretations
- Evaluating the effectiveness of different analytical approaches
- Considering how their own perspectives and assumptions shape their readings

## Practical Implementation: The Adaptive Teaching Cycle

### Responsive Planning

Adaptive teaching is not merely reactive; it involves **responsive planning** that anticipates likely areas of difficulty and prepares flexible scaffolds. This includes:

1. **Predictive assessment**: Before teaching, gathering information about pupils' existing knowledge and likely barriers
2. **Checkpoint questions**: Planning formative assessment moments that reveal developing understanding
3. **Contingency resources**: Preparing scaffolded materials that can be deployed if monitoring reveals need
4. **Fading plans**: Considering how supports will be gradually removed over sequences of lessons

### In-Lesson Adaptation

The heart of adaptive teaching occurs in the **moment-by-moment decisions** teachers make during lessons. This includes:

- **Questioning strategies**: Using targeted questioning to probe understanding and provide thinking time
- **Live modelling**: Responding to observed difficulties by demonstrating thinking processes
- **Strategic grouping**: Temporarily bringing together pupils with similar needs for focused support
- **Resource deployment**: Making scaffolds available without requiring their use (reducing stigma while ensuring access)

### The Role of Teaching Assistants

The deployment of teaching assistants is critical to effective adaptive teaching. Research by the
