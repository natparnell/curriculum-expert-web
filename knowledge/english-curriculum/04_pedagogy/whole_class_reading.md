# Whole-Class Reading: Approaches to Shared Texts and Close Reading Strategies

## Introduction: The Shift to Whole-Class Reading

Whole-class reading (also known as whole-class guided reading) represents a significant shift in how primary schools approach the teaching of reading comprehension in the United Kingdom. Rather than organising pupils into ability groups for guided reading sessions while others complete independent tasks, whole-class reading brings all children together to engage with the same rich text simultaneously. This approach aligns with the Department for Education's (DfE) Reading Framework (2021, updated 2023), which emphasises that "reading lessons need to create readers, not just pupils who can read" (DfE, 2023, p. 108).

The transition from traditional guided reading to whole-class approaches has been gathering momentum across English primary schools since approximately 2015, driven by concerns about the limitations of ability-grouped instruction and the potential of shared text experiences to elevate expectations and engagement for all pupils. As the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) notes, reading comprehension strategies taught through whole-class instruction can yield significant benefits, particularly when combined with metacognitive approaches that help pupils monitor and regulate their own understanding (EEF, 2023).

This knowledge base entry examines the theoretical foundations, practical implementation strategies, and evidence base for whole-class reading approaches in UK primary education, with particular attention to close reading strategies that enable deep engagement with shared texts.

## The Evidence Base for Whole-Class Reading

### Ofsted Research Review Series: English (2022)

Ofsted's Research Review Series for English, published in July 2022, provides substantial evidence for the effectiveness of whole-class approaches to reading instruction. The review emphasises that "comprehension depends on understanding whole sentences and the connections between them, in addition to understanding the meaning of individual words in those sentences" (Ofsted, 2022, p. 138). This insight underpins the rationale for whole-class reading: when all pupils engage with the same complex text, supported by expert teacher modelling and scaffolded discussion, they develop the syntactic awareness and inference-making capabilities necessary for deep comprehension.

The Ofsted review highlights several critical findings that support whole-class reading:

- **Vocabulary acquisition is context-dependent**: Pupils learn vocabulary more effectively when they encounter words in rich, meaningful contexts rather than through isolated instruction.
- **Background knowledge significantly influences comprehension**: Whole-class reading allows teachers to build collective knowledge that supports subsequent understanding.
- **Discussion enhances comprehension**: High-quality dialogue about texts improves pupils' ability to construct mental models of what they read.

### The DfE Reading Framework (2023)

The updated DfE Reading Framework, published in July 2023, significantly expands upon the original 2021 document to provide guidance extending through Key Stage 2 and beyond. The framework explicitly endorses whole-class approaches, noting that "sections nine and ten of the framework highlight how reading 'across the curriculum supports the knowledge and vocabulary to be learnt in each subject'" (VNET Education, 2023). This cross-curricular dimension is particularly important: whole-class reading techniques can be applied in history, geography, science, and other subjects to develop disciplinary literacy.

The framework provides specific guidance on whole-class session structures, emphasising:

- The importance of the teacher reading aloud with expert prosody (expressive, fluent reading that demonstrates meaning through intonation and phrasing)
- The role of repeated reading in developing fluency
- The balance between explicit strategy instruction and rich text-based discussion
- The need for all pupils to access the same challenging texts with appropriate scaffolding

### Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) Evidence

The EEF's Teaching and Learning Toolkit identifies reading comprehension strategies as having a high impact on pupil outcomes, with an average effect size of +6 months' additional progress (EEF, 2023). The EEF emphasises that these strategies are most effective when taught explicitly through whole-class instruction, with opportunities for pupils to apply them independently.

Crucially, the EEF's guidance on metacognition and self-regulated learning connects directly to whole-class reading approaches: "Through this, pupils learn to plan, monitor and evaluate their own comprehension and/or their own use of the comprehension strategies" (EEF, 2023). The EEF notes that metacognitive strategies are effective in whole-class, large group, small group, and one-to-one settings, but whole-class approaches offer the advantage of collective modelling and shared dialogue.

### Research on Reciprocal Reading

Reciprocal teaching, developed by Palincsar and Brown (1984), provides a structured framework for teaching comprehension strategies that translates effectively to whole-class settings. The approach focuses on four key strategies: predicting, questioning, clarifying, and summarising. The EEF-funded evaluation of FFT's Reciprocal Reading programme found that "a structured approach to teaching reading comprehension strategies" delivered at least twice weekly for 20–30 minutes can improve outcomes, particularly for disadvantaged pupils (EEF, 2023).

O'Hare's (2023) study comparing reciprocal reading interventions in disadvantaged primary schools found effect sizes consistent with earlier meta-analyses by Rosenshine and Meister (1994), which reported average effect sizes of 0.32 for reading and 0.88 for reading comprehension across 16 reciprocal teaching studies. While the EEF notes that UK-based evaluations sometimes show lower effects than international (primarily US) literature, the evidence base nonetheless supports the structured, explicit teaching of comprehension strategies within whole-class contexts.

## Key Principles of Effective Whole-Class Reading

### Principle 1: Creating Readers, Not Just Pupils Who Can Read

Aidan Chambers' seminal work "Tell Me" (1991, reprinted 2011) provides a philosophical foundation for whole-class reading that prioritises authentic reader response. Chambers proposes four key questions that readers should encounter with any text:

1. Was there anything you liked about this?
2. Was there anything you disliked?
3. Was there anything that puzzled you?
4. Were there any patterns – any connections – that you noticed?

These questions position pupils as genuine readers who bring their own experiences, preferences, and insights to texts, rather than merely as students performing comprehension exercises. The fourth question, in particular, sets up deeper analytical work by encouraging pupils to identify textual patterns and intertextual connections.

Effective whole-class reading implementation preserves this authentic reader response while also developing the comprehension strategies necessary for sophisticated textual analysis. As the DfE Reading Framework (2023) emphasises, "reading lessons need to create readers, not just pupils who can read" (p. 108). This means balancing the technical teaching of comprehension strategies with opportunities for personal response and aesthetic engagement.

### Principle 2: Teaching Comprehension Strategies, Not Generic Skills

Timothy Shanahan (2018) makes a crucial distinction between comprehension strategies and comprehension skills that has significant implications for whole-class reading pedagogy. Comprehension strategies are "actions that may help a reader to figure out and remember the information from a text" – metacognitive processes that readers can consciously deploy. Comprehension skills, by contrast, are often conceptualised as generic abilities (such as "finding the main idea" or "making inferences") that can be taught through repetitive worksheets.

Shanahan argues that "each text presents information in its own way, and reading comprehension is heavily bound up in the readers' knowledge of the topic covered by the text." Inference, for example, is not a generic skill but an outcome of reading that emerges from the interplay between textual information and reader knowledge. Effective whole-class reading therefore focuses on teaching pupils how to deploy strategies (activating background knowledge, questioning, visualising, monitoring comprehension, summarising) in response to specific textual demands, rather than practising decontextualised "skills."

The six core comprehension strategies identified in the research literature are:

1. **Activating and using background knowledge**: Connecting text content to existing knowledge and experiences
2. **Generating and asking questions**: Formulating queries that drive deeper engagement with the text
3. **Making predictions**: Anticipating what will come next based on textual cues and prior knowledge
4. **Visualising**: Creating mental images of what is being described
5. **Monitoring comprehension**: Recognising when understanding breaks down and deploying repair strategies
6. **Summarising**: Distilling the essential content of a passage or text

In whole-class reading, these strategies are modelled explicitly by the teacher through think-alouds, practised collaboratively through structured discussion, and applied independently by pupils with gradually reducing scaffolding.

### Principle 3: Layered Reading and Text Re-engagement

Doug Lemov, Colleen Driggs, and Erica Woolway's "Reading Reconsidered" (2016) introduces the concept of "layered reading" – approaching the same text multiple times with different purposes and at different depths. This approach is fundamental to whole-class reading pedagogy. Rather than reading a text once and moving to comprehension questions, pupils engage with the text repeatedly:

- **First encounter**: Building familiarity, establishing literal comprehension, and generating initial responses
- **Second encounter**: Examining specific passages in detail, analysing language choices and authorial craft
- **Third encounter**: Making connections across the text, identifying patterns and themes, and developing global inferences

Each re-engagement builds upon and deepens previous understanding. As Lemov et al. (2016) note, this approach treats texts as "inexhaustible resources" rather than material to be consumed and discarded. The teacher's role is to design purposeful re-reading opportunities that illuminate different textual layers.

### Principle 4: The Gradual Release of Responsibility

The gradual release of responsibility model (Pearson and Gallagher, 1983) provides the instructional architecture for whole-class reading sessions. This model progresses through four stages:

1. **Teacher modelling**: The teacher demonstrates expert reading behaviours, thinking aloud to make internal processes visible
2. **Guided practice**: Pupils attempt strategies with teacher support, through collaborative discussion and scaffolded questioning
3. **Collaborative practice**: Pupils work in pairs or small groups to apply strategies with peer support
4. **Independent application**: Pupils deploy strategies autonomously, monitoring and regulating their own comprehension

In a whole-class reading lesson, these stages may occur sequentially across a single session or across a sequence of lessons focused on the same text. The key is that pupils move from observation through supported practice to independent application, with the teacher continuously monitoring progress and adjusting scaffolding.

## Structuring Whole-Class Reading Lessons

### Phase 1: Pre-Reading Preparation

Effective whole-class reading lessons begin before the text is encountered. The pre-reading phase establishes the foundations for comprehension by addressing three key areas: prior knowledge activation, vocabulary preparation, and text orientation.

#### Activating Prior Knowledge

Research consistently demonstrates that comprehension depends significantly on the reader's relevant background knowledge (Willingham, 2006). The pre-reading phase should therefore identify what pupils already know about the topic, context, or genre of the text, and fill critical gaps that would impede understanding.

Strategies for activating prior knowledge include:

- **KWL charts**: Recording what pupils Know, Want to know, and (after reading) have Learned
- **Concept maps**: Exploring relationships between key concepts that will appear in the text
- **Image analysis**: Examining photographs, illustrations, or artefacts related to the text's content or setting
- **Anticipation guides**: Presenting statements related to text themes for pupils to agree or disagree with before reading

The teacher must make informed decisions about which background knowledge is essential for comprehension and which can be developed through the reading itself. As Shanahan (2018) notes, "inference is an outcome of reading" – some connections should emerge from the text encounter rather than being pre-taught.

#### Pre-Teaching Vocabulary

Vocabulary knowledge is one of the strongest predictors of reading comprehension (Beck and McKeown, 2007). The DfE Reading Framework (2023) emphasises that "explicit teaching needs to be planned with the intentional delivery of specific vocabulary" to ensure learners acquire word meanings effectively.

In the pre-reading phase, teachers should identify potentially challenging vocabulary and decide on an instructional approach:

- **Tier 2 words** (high-utility academic vocabulary such as "reluctant," "examine," "conclude") warrant explicit instruction using strategies such as:
  - Providing student-friendly definitions
  - Examining word morphology (prefixes, roots, suffixes)
  - Exploring etymology and word histories
  - Creating visual representations or gestures
  - Using the word in multiple contexts

- **Tier 3 words** (domain-specific vocabulary such as "photosynthesis," "democracy," "metaphor") require clear definition and may benefit from visual support or concrete examples

- **Words best left to context**: Some vocabulary is either not critical to comprehension or can be sufficiently inferred from context; these should not be pre-taught

Alex Quigley (2020), in "Closing the Reading Gap," advocates for a nuanced approach that considers the utility of vocabulary beyond the immediate text. Words that pupils are likely to encounter again in academic contexts warrant more substantial instructional investment.

#### Orienting to Text Structure

Before reading, pupils should understand what kind of text they are encountering and how its structure can support comprehension. Questions to explore include:

- What genre is this text? What features do we expect to find?
- How is the text organised? (chronological, cause-effect, problem-solution, compare-contrast)
- What textual features (headings, subheadings, diagrams, captions) can help us navigate the content?
- Who is the intended audience? How does this influence the text's language and presentation?

This structural orientation provides a mental framework for organising information as it is encountered during reading.

### Phase 2: First Reading – Building the Mental Model

The first reading aims to establish a basic mental model of the text – a coherent representation in working memory of what the text describes. This phase prioritises fluency and literal comprehension over deep analysis.

#### Teacher Read-Aloud with Expert Prosody

During the first reading, the teacher typically reads aloud while pupils follow along in their own copies or on a shared display. This approach, advocated in the DfE Reading Framework (2023), ensures that:

- All pupils access the text regardless of their decoding ability
- The teacher models fluent, expressive reading (prosody) that conveys meaning through intonation, phrasing, and emphasis
- Pupils can focus on comprehension without the cognitive burden of decoding unfamiliar words

The framework explicitly cautions against the practice of asking individual pupils to read aloud in front of the class, noting that this "tends to create a league of readers, where some are asked to read and others are not" (DfE, 2023, p. 112). Instead, techniques such as "jump-in" reading (where the teacher pauses and all pupils read the next word chorally) can be used to check engagement without singling individuals out.

#### Echo and Choral Reading

Echo reading and choral reading provide additional fluency support within whole-class contexts:

- **Echo reading**: The teacher reads a phrase or sentence with expert prosody, and pupils echo it back. This technique, recommended by Hampshire Inspection and Advisory Service (HIAS, 2025), allows pupils to "mimic the teacher's expressive and fluent reading of the text so that they become familiar with what fluency sounds like in their own voices." Echo reading is particularly effective for short, complex passages where prosody significantly affects meaning.

- **Choral reading**: The whole class reads a passage aloud together. This provides a "safe" environment for reluctant readers to participate without individual exposure, while the group voice supports those who might struggle with independent reading.

Research has shown that "echo reading with a fluent adult model improved reading accuracy rates on familiar passages" (Brookes Publishing, 2024), supporting its inclusion in whole-class reading repertoires.

#### Initial Comprehension Monitoring

During the first reading, the teacher should pause periodically to model comprehension monitoring through think-alouds. These metacognitive demonstrations make visible the normally invisible processes of expert reading:

- "I'm confused here – let me re-read that sentence to check I understood."
- "This word 'reluctant' – I think it means hesitant or unwilling, based on the context."
- "I'm making a prediction about what will happen next based on this clue..."

These think-alouds introduce the comprehension strategies that pupils will later apply independently. However, the teacher must balance explicit modelling with maintaining engagement in the text; excessive interruption can disrupt the flow of reading and spoil narrative immersion.

### Phase 3: Re-Reading for Depth and Analysis

The second encounter with the text focuses on close reading – examining specific passages in detail to analyse language choices, develop inferences, and construct deeper meaning. This phase exemplifies the "layered reading" approach (Lemov et al., 2016).

#### Zooming In: Local Inferences

Close reading involves "zooming in" on particular words, phrases, or sentences to make local inferences – connections between adjacent pieces of information. Key techniques include:

- **Pronoun resolution**: Identifying what pronouns (he, she, it, they) refer back to, which is often a source of comprehension breakdown
- **Sentence-level summarising**: Distilling the essential meaning of individual sentences or short paragraphs
- **Word choice analysis**: Examining why the author chose particular words and what connotations they carry
- **Syntax examination**: Analysing how sentence structure contributes to meaning

Tim Shanahan (2019) describes summarising as capturing "both language skills and content knowledge: a powerful combination." At the paragraph level, effective summarising involves deleting unnecessary information, grouping related ideas, and composing a sentence that captures what remains.

#### Zooming Out: Global Inferences

Close reading also involves "zooming out" to make global inferences – connections across larger sections of the text and beyond. This includes:

- **Tracing themes and patterns**: Following how motifs, symbols, or ideas develop across the text (what Michael Rosen calls identifying "secret strings")
- **Intertextual connections**: Linking the current text to other texts the class has read
- **Contextual connections**: Connecting the text to historical, cultural, or personal contexts
- **Authorial intent**: Considering why the author made particular choices and what effects they intended

The teacher facilitates this by asking questions that promote elaboration and flexible thinking, supporting pupils to "integrate new ideas and knowledge into their existing schema" (DfE Reading Framework, 2023, p. 118). These questions should be text-specific
