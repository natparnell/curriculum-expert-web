# Teaching Grammar in Context: Embedded Grammar and Myhill's Approach

## Introduction: Rethinking Grammar Pedagogy

For much of the twentieth century, grammar teaching in English classrooms followed a largely decontextualised, rules-based approach. Pupils were taught to identify parts of speech, parse sentences, and memorise grammatical rules in isolation from meaningful language use. This approach, often characterised by the study of Latin grammatical frameworks applied to English, dominated until research began to question its efficacy for developing writing proficiency.

The pivotal shift in thinking came with the recognition that grammar is not merely a set of rules to be learned and applied prescriptively, but rather a **meaning-making resource** that writers deploy deliberately to achieve particular effects. This reconceptualisation of grammar as functional and contextual has profound implications for how teachers approach grammar instruction in the primary and secondary classroom.

Research by Debra Myhill and colleagues at the University of Exeter has provided robust evidence for the first time that grammar teaching, when embedded within the context of writing instruction, can positively impact student outcomes. Their large-scale national studies demonstrated that **contextualised grammar teaching**—grammar taught in relation to the writing being developed rather than as a separate skill—improves both writing quality and metalinguistic understanding.

This knowledge file explores the theoretical foundations, research evidence, and practical classroom applications of embedded grammar teaching, with particular focus on Myhill's Grammar for Writing approach and its implications for curriculum design and pedagogy across the key stages.

## The Research Foundation: Myhill's Grammar for Writing Studies

### The Problem with Decontextualised Grammar

Before examining Myhill's research contributions, it is essential to understand the context of grammar teaching in English schools. The statutory National Curriculum introduced in 2014 significantly increased the explicit grammar content pupils were expected to learn, with the introduction of a dedicated English grammar, punctuation, and spelling (GPS or SPaG) test at Key Stage 2. This policy shift raised fundamental questions about the relationship between grammatical knowledge and writing development.

Debra Myhill, in her extensive body of research, has identified a persistent problem in English education: **"grammar is error and error is grammar in the public mind"**. This conflation of grammar with correctness has led to approaches that focus primarily on error detection and correction, rather than on developing pupils' capacity to use grammatical structures purposefully and effectively.

Decontextualised grammar teaching typically involves:
- Learning grammatical terminology in isolation from texts
- Identifying parts of speech in decontextualised sentences
- Memorising rules without understanding their functional application
- Focusing on error correction rather than purposeful language choices
- Separating grammar instruction from the writing process

Research has consistently failed to demonstrate that such approaches improve writing quality. As Myhill and Watson (2014) note in their comprehensive review of the literature, the evidence for traditional grammar teaching leading to improved writing is "weak to non-existent."

### The Grammar for Writing Randomised Controlled Trial

The landmark study that shifted the debate was the **Grammar for Writing** project, a large-scale randomised controlled trial conducted across England involving over 700 pupils in 31 schools.

**Study Design and Methodology**

The study set out to investigate whether contextualised teaching of grammar, linked explicitly to the teaching of writing, would improve pupil outcomes in both writing quality and metalinguistic understanding. The intervention was designed with several key features:

1. **Embeddedness**: Grammar was taught within the context of pupils' own writing and through analysis of authentic texts, not through abstract exercises.

2. **Explicitness**: Teachers used explicit metalanguage (grammatical terminology) but always in relation to effects and choices, not rules.

3. **Discussion**: Lessons incorporated substantial discussion about language choices, encouraging pupils to articulate their understanding of how grammar functions.

4. **Playful experimentation**: Pupils were encouraged to try out grammatical structures, revise their choices, and reflect on the effects achieved.

The intervention was delivered over 11 weeks to Year 8 pupils (age 12-13), with teaching materials designed in collaboration with participating teachers.

**Key Findings**

The study yielded significant findings that have shaped subsequent grammar pedagogy:

- **Writing improvement**: Pupils in the intervention group showed statistically significant improvements in writing quality compared to the control group.
- **Metalinguistic understanding**: Pupils developed more sophisticated understanding of how grammatical choices affect meaning.
- **Transfer to unfamiliar genres**: Improved writing was evident not only in the genres explicitly taught but in unfamiliar writing tasks, suggesting genuine development of transferable knowledge.

Importantly, teacher interviews and lesson observations revealed that teachers found the **explicitness**, the **use of discussion**, and the emphasis on **playful experimentation** to be the most salient and effective features of the intervention.

### Types of Grammatical Knowledge

A follow-up investigation examined the relationship between grammatical knowledge and writing development more precisely. This research distinguished between:

- **Declarative knowledge**: Knowing grammatical terminology and being able to identify structures
- **Procedural knowledge**: Being able to use grammatical structures effectively in writing
- **Conditional knowledge**: Understanding when and why to use particular structures (the writer's decision-making)

The study found that while declarative knowledge alone does not improve writing, the combination of declarative, procedural, and **conditional knowledge**—knowing when particular grammatical choices are appropriate—is what enables pupils to write more effectively.

## Theoretical Foundations: Systemic Functional Linguistics

While Myhill's research has provided the empirical evidence for contextualised grammar teaching, the theoretical foundation draws significantly on **Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL)**, developed by Michael Halliday. Understanding SFL helps teachers grasp why embedded grammar teaching works and how to design effective instruction.

### Language as a Meaning-Making Resource

The fundamental insight of SFL is that language is not a system of rules but a **system of choices**. Every time we use language, we make choices from available options, and these choices are meaningful. This contrasts sharply with traditional grammar approaches that treat language as a set of prescriptive rules governing correct usage.

Halliday's model identifies three interconnected **metafunctions** of language:

1. **Ideational metafunction**: Language represents our experience of the world—how we construct reality through clauses and processes.

2. **Interpersonal metafunction**: Language enables us to interact with others—how we negotiate relationships, express attitudes, and influence behaviour.

3. **Textual metafunction**: Language allows us to create coherent and cohesive texts—how we organise information flow and structure discourse.

For teachers of writing, this framework is powerful because it shifts focus from grammatical correctness to **grammatical choice**. Instead of asking "Is this sentence grammatically correct?" we ask "What meaning is this grammatical choice making? Could a different choice make a different meaning?"

### The Teaching and Learning Cycle

SFL-informed pedagogy employs what is known as the **Teaching and Learning Cycle** or "genre pedagogy." This cycle provides a structured approach to teaching writing that integrates grammar instruction naturally:

1. **Building the field**: Developing knowledge of the topic and context through reading, discussion, and research.

2. **Modelling and deconstruction**: Analysing mentor texts to understand how expert writers use language, including examination of grammatical choices and their effects.

3. **Joint construction**: Teacher and pupils collaboratively compose a text, making language choices explicit and discussing alternatives.

4. **Independent construction**: Pupils write independently, applying what they have learned.

5. **Review and revision**: Critically examining the effectiveness of language choices and revising accordingly.

Grammar instruction is embedded throughout this cycle, particularly in the deconstruction and joint construction phases where pupils examine how grammatical choices create meaning and practise making similar choices themselves.

## Key Principles of Embedded Grammar Teaching

Drawing together the research evidence and theoretical foundations, we can identify key principles that should guide embedded grammar teaching in the classroom.

### Grammar as Choice, Not Rule

The central principle is that grammar should be taught as a **system of choices** rather than a set of rules. This has profound implications for classroom language and activity:

- Instead of: "You must use a fronted adverbial here."
- Try: "What happens if we move this phrase to the beginning? How does it change the emphasis?"

- Instead of: "That's wrong—you cannot start a sentence with 'because'."
- Try: "Writers sometimes start sentences with 'because' to create a particular effect. When might that work? When might it cause confusion?"

This approach positions pupils as **decision-makers** who make informed choices about language, rather than as rule-followers who simply apply prescriptions.

### Explicit Discussion and Articulation

Myhill's research highlights the importance of **explicitness** and **discussion**. Pupils benefit from being able to articulate their understanding of how language works. This involves:

- Using grammatical metalanguage precisely but accessibly
- Encouraging pupils to explain their language choices
- Discussing alternatives and their different effects
- Making the invisible (mental processes of writing) visible through dialogue

Classroom discussion should move beyond "right or wrong" to explore "how and why." Questions like "What effect does this structure create?" and "How else could we express this idea?" open up productive exploration of grammatical choices.

### Exploration and Experimentation

The principle of **playful experimentation** emerged as particularly significant in teacher feedback from the Grammar for Writing study. Pupils need opportunities to try out grammatical structures, see what effects they create, and revise their choices.

This contrasts with approaches where pupils are expected to "get it right first time." Writing development involves exploration, risk-taking, and learning from attempts that do not work as intended. Teachers should create classroom cultures where experimentation is encouraged and where "mistakes" are reframed as learning opportunities.

Practical strategies include:
- Trying multiple versions of a sentence and comparing effects
- "Messing about" with mentor texts to see what happens when structures are changed
- Collaborative writing where decisions are made transparently and debated
- Revision focused specifically on grammatical choices and their impact

### Contextual Authenticity

Grammar must be taught in **authentic contexts**—in relation to real writing tasks and authentic texts. This means:

- Using mentor texts written by expert writers, not artificial examples created for grammar exercises
- Connecting grammar instruction to pupils' own writing processes
- Examining how grammatical choices serve particular purposes in particular genres
- Avoiding decontextualised worksheets and exercises

When pupils examine how professional writers use passive voice to shift focus, or how fronted adverbials create cohesion across paragraphs, they see grammar functioning purposefully in authentic communication.

### Integration with the Writing Process

Grammar instruction should be **integrated throughout the writing process**, not bolted on as a separate activity. This includes:

- **Planning**: Considering how sentence structures might serve the intended purpose and audience
- **Drafting**: Making grammatical choices deliberately as part of composition
- **Revision**: Critically examining the effectiveness of grammatical choices and revising for impact
- **Editing**: Checking that grammatical choices have been executed accurately

The traditional model of teaching grammar first and then hoping it transfers to writing has been shown not to work. Grammar must be taught **in and through** writing.

## Progression Across the Key Stages

Embedded grammar teaching must be adapted to pupils' developmental stages while maintaining consistent principles. The following outlines progression from Early Years through Key Stage 4.

### Early Years Foundation Stage (Ages 3-5)

In the EYFS, grammar development is implicit and embedded within rich language experiences. The focus is on:

**Spoken Language Foundations**
- Hearing and using a wide range of sentence structures through stories, songs, and conversation
- Developing vocabulary that supports increasingly complex expression
- Playing with language through rhymes, word games, and imaginative play
- Listening to and discussing stories that model varied sentence structures

**Emergent Writing**
- Experiencing writing as meaningful communication through shared writing activities
- Beginning to hear and represent sentence boundaries in emergent writing
- Developing understanding of how spoken language maps onto written forms

**Adult Role**
- Modelling rich and varied language use throughout the day
- Extending children's utterances by recasting in more complex forms
- Reading aloud a wide range of texts that model grammatical variety
- Engaging children in dialogic talk that supports language development

At this stage, explicit grammatical terminology is not appropriate, but the foundations for later explicit teaching are being laid through rich language experience.

### Key Stage 1 (Ages 5-7)

The National Curriculum for Years 1 and 2 introduces grammatical terminology and concepts that should be taught in the context of reading and writing.

**Year 1 Expectations**
- Word classes: nouns, adjectives, verbs
- Sentence boundaries: capital letters and full stops
- Singular and plural
- Joining words and clauses using "and"

**Year 2 Expectations**
- Expanded noun phrases for description
- Different sentence types (statements, questions, exclamations, commands)
- Present and past tense consistently
- Subordination (using "when," "if," "that," "because") and coordination (using "or," "but," "so")

**Embedded Teaching Approaches**

At KS1, grammar should be taught primarily through:

- **Shared reading**: Discussing how authors use particular structures in familiar texts
- **Shared writing**: Making grammatical choices visible and audible as the teacher models writing
- **Oral rehearsal**: Helping children compose sentences orally before writing
- **Sentence composition games**: Playing with sentence structures in low-stakes contexts

For example, when reading a familiar story, the teacher might pause to discuss: "The author says 'the enormous, scary giant.' Those are adjectives describing the giant. What other adjectives could we use? How would they change the picture in our minds?"

### Key Stage 2 (Ages 7-11)

KS2 sees significant expansion in grammatical content and the introduction of the grammar, punctuation, and spelling test. The challenge is to meet statutory requirements while maintaining embedded, purposeful grammar teaching.

**Lower KS2 (Years 3-4)**
- Extending the range of sentences with more than one clause
- Recognising and using nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions
- Choosing nouns and pronouns for clarity and cohesion
- Fronted adverbials
- Inverted commas for direct speech
- Apostrophes for possession and contraction

**Upper KS2 (Years 5-6)**
- Relative clauses beginning with who, which, where, when, whose, that
- Modal verbs and adverbs indicating degrees of possibility
- Expanded noun phrases conveying complicated information concisely
- Active and passive voice
- Subject and object
- Hyphens, dashes, colons, semi-colons
- Layout devices (headings, bullet points)

**Teaching for Understanding, Not Just Identification**

The GPS test assesses recognition and identification of grammatical structures, but teaching should go beyond this to develop understanding of how these structures function:

- **Fronted adverbials**: Not just "Can you identify the fronted adverbial?" but "Why has the writer started with this phrase? How does it link to the previous paragraph?"

- **Relative clauses**: Not just "Add a relative clause to this sentence" but "How does adding this information change the noun? Why might the writer want to do this?"

- **Passive voice**: Not just "Change this to passive voice" but "When might a writer want to shift focus from who did something to what was done?"

**KS2-3 Transition**

The transition to secondary school often sees a regression in writing quality as pupils struggle to apply their grammatical knowledge in more sophisticated contexts. To support transition:

- Maintain focus on grammatical choices and their effects, not just identification
- Ensure pupils can apply knowledge across different genres and purposes
- Develop metalinguistic vocabulary for discussing language choices
- Build confidence with conditional knowledge (when and why to use structures)

### Key Stage 3 (Ages 11-14)

KS3 should build on KS2 foundations, deepening understanding of grammatical concepts and developing more sophisticated application. The Grammar for Writing research was conducted at this level and provides a model for effective practice.

**Developing Sophistication**
- Understanding how different sentence structures create different effects
- Exploring authorial voice and how grammatical choices construct persona
- Analysing how writers manipulate cohesion and coherence through grammar
- Making deliberate choices about formality and register through grammatical structures

**Teaching Approaches**
- Close analysis of mentor texts examining grammatical choices
- Sentence combining and expansion activities
- Revision workshops focused on grammatical transformation for effect
- Exploration of how grammar functions differently across genres

**Common Misconceptions at KS3**

Pupils at this stage often exhibit several misconceptions that need addressing:

- **Complexity equals quality**: Pupils may believe that longer, more complex sentences are always better. Teachers need to explore how sentence variety (including short, simple sentences) creates effect.

- **There is one right way**: Pupils may have internalised that grammar is about correctness rather than choice. Explicit work on alternatives and their effects is essential.

- **Grammar is just punctuation and spelling**: Pupils may not appreciate the broader scope of grammatical choices in creating meaning. Exploring process types, voice, and theme/rheme organisation helps broaden understanding.

### Key Stage 4 (Ages 14-16)

At KS4, pupils should be able to use grammatical knowledge with increasing independence and sophistication, applying it to the demands of GCSE English Language and Literature.

**GCSE English Language**
- Analysing how writers use grammatical structures for specific effects (Paper 1, Question 2 and Paper 2, Question 3)
- Making deliberate grammatical choices in own writing to achieve intended effects (Paper 1 and Paper 2 Section B)
- Understanding how register and formality are constructed through grammar

**GCSE English Literature**
- Analysing how dramatists and poets use grammatical structures
- Understanding how grammatical choices contribute to characterisation, voice, and theme

**Developing Independence**
- Pupils should be able to discuss their own grammatical choices using appropriate metalanguage
- Self-directed revision of grammatical choices in their own writing
- Critical analysis of grammatical choices in unseen texts

## Practical Classroom Strategies

The following strategies support embedded grammar teaching across all key stages.

### Mentor Text Analysis

Using authentic texts as models:

1. **Select strategically**: Choose texts that demonstrate specific grammatical features relevant to the writing pupils are working on.

2. **Focus on effects**: Guide analysis beyond identification to consideration of effects. "The writer uses passive voice here—what is the effect of shifting attention away from who is acting?"

3. **Connect to pupils' writing**: Always bridge back to how pupils might use similar structures in their own writing.

### Sentence Combining and Expansion

Activities that build syntactic awareness:

- Combine short, choppy sentences into more fluent constructions
- Expand kernel sentences by adding detail through adverbials and modification
- Experiment with different ways of expressing the same idea
- Compare the effects of different combinations

### Dictogloss and Reconstruction

1. Teacher reads a short text aloud while pupils listen
2. Pupils reconstruct the text from memory, working in groups
3. Groups compare versions and discuss the grammatical choices they made
4. Class examines the original and discusses the writer's choices

### Grammar in Revision

Teach grammar explicitly as part of the revision process:

- **Highlighters**: Use different colours to track sentence openings, clause structures, or process types
- **Transformation**: Take a paragraph and systematically transform grammatical features (e.g., change all active verbs to passive) to observe effects
- **Targeted revision**: Focus revision specifically on grammatical choices—"Revise this opening for greater cohesion" or "Vary your sentence structures to create tension"

### Dialogic Teaching

Myhill's research emphasises the importance of classroom talk about grammar:

- Use open questions that invite exploration: "Why might a writer choose this structure?"
- Encourage pupils to articulate their thinking: "Explain why you made that choice."
- Model the language of grammatical choice: "I am choosing passive voice here because I want to focus on..."
- Create spaces for collaborative decision-making about language

## Common Misconceptions and How to Address Them

Understanding common misconceptions helps teachers anticipate and address them proactively.

### Misconception 1: "Grammar is just about being correct"

**The issue**: Pupils (and sometimes teachers) view grammar as a set of rules for avoiding errors rather than as a toolkit for creating meaning.

**Addressing it**:
- Consistently frame grammar as choice rather than rule
- Discuss why writers break "rules" for effect
- Focus lessons on what grammar can do, not just what it should be

### Misconception 2: "More complex grammar is always better"

**The issue**: Pupils believe that sophisticated writing means using the most complex structures possible, leading to over-elaborate, unclear writing.

**Addressing it**:
- Analyse how effective writers use simple sentences for impact
- Explore how sentence variety (not just complexity) creates rhythm and emphasis
- Provide models where short, punchy sentences are effective

### Misconception 3: "I need to learn all the terminology before I can write well"

**The issue**: Pupils become overwhelmed by metalanguage and lose sight of purposeful writing.

**Addressing it**:
- Introduce terminology in context, as needed for discussion
- Focus first on effects and choices; terminology serves the discussion, not vice versa
- Allow pupils to describe grammatical features in their own words before introducing technical terms

### Misconception 4: "Grammar is separate from what I want to say"

**The issue**: Pupils see grammar as an extra layer applied after content is determined.

**Addressing it**:
- Teach grammar as integral to meaning-making
- Show how different grammatical choices express different meanings
- Emphasise that form and content are inseparable

### Misconception 5: "Once I've learned a structure, I should always use it"

**The issue**: Pupils overuse newly learned structures (e.g., fronted adverbials in every sentence) without considering appropriateness.

**Addressing it**:
- Discuss the concept of appropriateness and register
- Analyse when particular structures enhance or detract from meaning
- Encourage conscious, deliberate selection from a range of options

## Assessment Considerations

Assessing embedded grammar presents particular challenges, as traditional tests tend to assess declarative knowledge in isolation from writing.

### Formative Assessment

- **Writing conferences**: Discuss grammatical choices with pupils during drafting and revision
- **Targeted feedback**: Focus feedback on specific grammatical features relevant to current learning
- **Self-assessment**: Teach pupils to evaluate their own grammatical choices using clear criteria

### Summative Assessment

- **Integrated assessment**: Evaluate grammatical choices as part of holistic writing assessment
- **Commentary tasks**: Ask pupils to explain the grammatical choices they made in a piece of writing
- **Comparative analysis**: Provide pupils with two versions of a text and ask them to compare grammatical choices and effects

### National Curriculum Assessment

The GPS tests at KS1 and KS2 assess recognition and identification skills. While teachers must prepare pupils for these assessments, the evidence suggests that:

- Teaching to the test (decontextualised grammar exercises) does not improve writing
- Embedded grammar teaching prepares pupils for the test while also developing writing
- A balanced approach addresses both declarative and conditional knowledge

## Conclusion: Towards a Grammar-Rich Writing Curriculum

The research evidence is clear: grammar teaching improves writing only when it is **embedded**, **explicit**, **discussed**, and **purposeful**. Decontextualised grammar exercises, no matter how well-intentioned, do not transfer to writing improvement.

Implementing embedded grammar teaching requires:

1. **Subject knowledge**: Teachers need confident understanding of grammatical concepts to teach them in context.

2. **Pedagogical shift**: Moving from transmission models to inquiry-based, dialogic approaches where pupils explore and discuss grammatical choices.

3. **Curriculum coherence**: Integrating grammar instruction within a coherent writing curriculum, not treating it as a separate strand.

4. **Authentic contexts**: Using real texts and meaningful writing tasks as the basis for grammar instruction.

5. **Assessment alignment**: Developing assessment practices that evaluate conditional knowledge (when and why to use structures) alongside declarative knowledge.

The Grammar for Writing research provides a robust foundation for this approach, demonstrating that when grammar is taught as a meaning-making resource within the context of writing instruction, pupils do write better. The challenge for teachers and curriculum leaders is to resist the pull of decontextualised, worksheet-based approaches and instead commit to the richer, more complex work of embedded grammar teaching.

As Myhill argues, grammar is "a way of making meaning, a resource for expressing our experience of the world and our relationships with others." When we teach grammar in this spirit, we equip pupils not merely to avoid errors but to craft their writing with purpose, precision, and power.
