# Key Stage 3 English: Statutory Requirements

## Introduction

The Key Stage 3 (KS3) English programme of study applies to Years 7, 8, and 9 in maintained schools in England. Established under the National Curriculum framework first introduced in 1988 and subsequently revised—notably in 2014—the KS3 English curriculum sets out the statutory requirements that all pupils must be taught during these crucial years of secondary education. The programme of study is designed to build upon the foundations laid at Key Stages 1 and 2, preparing students for the demands of GCSE English Language and English Literature at Key Stage 4.

The overarching aim for English in the National Curriculum, as stated by the Department for Education, is "to promote high standards of language and literacy by equipping pupils with a strong command of the spoken and written language, and to develop their love of literature through widespread reading for enjoyment." This dual focus on language competence and literary appreciation characterises the distinctive contribution of English education to the broader school curriculum.

At KS3, the statutory programme of study is organised into three interrelated domains: **Reading**, **Writing**, and **Grammar and Vocabulary**. Unlike at Key Stages 1 and 2, Spoken Language is not a separate programme of study at KS3, though the importance of oracy continues to be emphasised through the requirements for discussion, presentation, and dramatic performance embedded within the three statutory areas. Schools are expected to integrate spoken language development across all aspects of English teaching.

This document provides a comprehensive account of the statutory requirements for Key Stage 3 English, drawing upon the official National Curriculum documentation published by the Department for Education, alongside interpretations from professional bodies such as the English Association and the National Association for the Teaching of English (NATE). It also references insights from Ofsted's 2022 Curriculum Research Review: English, which examined the factors contributing to high-quality English provision in secondary schools.

## Aims of the National Curriculum for English

Before examining the specific statutory requirements for Key Stage 3, it is important to understand the broad aims that underpin the English programme of study across all key stages. The National Curriculum for English aims to ensure that all pupils:

1. **Read easily, fluently and with good understanding**: This foundational aim recognises that reading proficiency is essential for access to the whole curriculum and for participation in democratic society. At KS3, this involves developing the ability to read increasingly challenging texts independently, including whole books, short stories, poems, and plays.

2. **Develop the habit of reading widely and often, for both pleasure and information**: The distinction between reading for pleasure and reading for information is significant. The curriculum recognises that different purposes for reading require different approaches, and that both are valuable. The emphasis on developing a "habit" of reading suggests that the curriculum aims to inculcate dispositions and practices that will persist beyond formal schooling.

3. **Acquire a wide vocabulary, an understanding of grammar and knowledge of linguistic conventions for reading, writing and spoken language**: This aim establishes the importance of explicit knowledge about language—knowing how language works, not merely being able to use it. The reference to "linguistic conventions" encompasses understanding of register, tone, and the expectations associated with different genres and contexts.

4. **Appreciate our rich and varied literary heritage**: This aim signals the importance of cultural transmission, ensuring that students encounter significant works from the English literary tradition, including those from before 1914.

5. **Write clearly, accurately and coherently, adapting their language and style in and for a range of contexts, purposes and audiences**: The emphasis here is on writing as a purposeful, rhetorical activity. The requirement to "adapt" language and style recognises that effective writing requires awareness of context and audience, not merely technical correctness.

6. **Use discussion in order to learn**: This aim establishes the importance of oracy as a tool for learning. The curriculum expects that pupils will "elaborate and explain clearly their understanding and ideas" through discussion, making their thinking visible and subject to refinement.

7. **Are competent in the arts of speaking and listening**: The final aim addresses the importance of oracy as a domain of competence in its own right, not merely as a means to other learning. Pupils should be able to "make formal presentations, demonstrate to others and participate in debate," recognising that these are skills required for civic and professional participation.

These aims inform the specific statutory requirements for Key Stage 3, providing the rationale for the content and approaches that schools are required to implement.

## Statutory Requirements: Reading

### The Range of Reading

The National Curriculum requires that at Key Stage 3, pupils should be taught to **read a wide range of fiction and non-fiction**. This requirement encompasses several specific categories of text that schools must include in their curriculum:

#### Whole Books, Short Stories, Poems and Plays

The requirement to read "whole books" is significant, distinguishing the KS3 curriculum from approaches that rely exclusively on extracts or anthologised selections. Reading whole texts enables students to understand how texts are structured and paced, to follow the development of characters and themes over extended narratives, and to experience the satisfactions of sustained reading. This requirement applies to fiction, poetry, and drama.

#### Wide Coverage of Genres, Historical Periods, Forms and Authors

The curriculum explicitly requires "wide coverage" across multiple dimensions:

- **Genres**: Pupils should encounter texts from different genres, including but not limited to: the novel, short story, poetry (lyric, narrative, dramatic, and contemporary forms), drama (tragedy, comedy, history), and non-fiction genres such as autobiography, travel writing, journalism, and digital texts.

- **Historical periods**: The curriculum requires that pupils read texts from different historical periods, including pre-1914 literature. This ensures that students encounter the literary heritage referenced in Aim 4, developing understanding of how English literature has developed over time and how texts reflect the periods in which they were produced.

- **Forms**: The reference to "forms" encompasses both literary forms (poetry, prose, drama) and the various sub-forms within these categories (sonnet, ode, epic; novel, novella, short story; tragedy, comedy, history, modern drama).

- **Authors**: The requirement for "wide coverage" of authors implies that pupils should encounter works by different writers, including both established canonical figures and contemporary writers.

#### High-Quality Works from English Literature

The curriculum requires that pupils read "high-quality works from English literature." The term "high-quality" is deliberately evaluative, implying that not all texts are equally valuable for educational purposes. Schools must exercise professional judgment in selecting texts that offer linguistic richness, thematic depth, and opportunities for developing appreciation of literary craft.

The requirement for works "from English literature" encompasses:

- **Pre-1914 literature**: Pupils must study texts written before 1914. This requirement ensures engagement with the literary heritage, including works from the medieval period (in modern translation or adaptation where appropriate), the Renaissance, the eighteenth century, and the Victorian period.

- **Contemporary literature**: Pupils must also study contemporary works, ensuring that their reading is not confined to the past and that they encounter literature addressing contemporary themes and employing contemporary forms.

#### Shakespeare

The National Curriculum makes specific statutory provision for the study of Shakespeare. At Key Stage 3, pupils **must study two plays by Shakespeare**. This requirement reflects Shakespeare's central place in English literary and cultural heritage, as well as the distinctive challenges and rewards that Shakespearean drama presents to young readers and theatre-goers.

The requirement for two plays provides opportunities for students to develop familiarity with Shakespearean language, dramatic conventions, and thematic concerns across different works. Schools typically select plays that offer contrasts in genre (e.g., a comedy and a tragedy), historical setting, or thematic focus.

#### Seminal World Literature

The requirement for "seminal world literature" ensures that pupils' reading is not confined to works from the English-speaking world. "Seminal" implies works that have had significant influence or that exemplify important literary traditions. This might include works in translation from European, Asian, African, or American literary traditions, as well as works from indigenous and postcolonial literatures.

### Reading Skills and Strategies

Beyond specifying the range of reading, the National Curriculum sets out statutory requirements for the skills and strategies that pupils should develop:

#### Reading for Understanding

Pupils should be taught to **read critically**, which involves:

- Understanding increasingly challenging texts through:
  - Learning new vocabulary, relating it explicitly to known vocabulary and understanding it with the help of context and dictionaries
  - Making inferences and referring to evidence in the text
  - Knowing the purpose, audience for and context of the writing and drawing on this knowledge to support comprehension
  - Checking their understanding to make sure that what they have read makes sense

These requirements establish that reading is an active, constructive process. The reference to "making inferences" recognises that texts do not explicitly state all their meanings, and that skilled readers must draw implications from what is stated. The requirement to "refer to evidence" establishes the importance of grounding interpretations in textual specifics.

#### Critical Reading

The curriculum requires that pupils engage in critical reading, which involves:

- Discussing and evaluating how authors use language, including figurative language, considering the impact on the reader
- Distinguishing between statements of fact and opinion
- Comparing different texts, considering themes, characterisation, style, and linguistic choices

This emphasis on critical reading moves beyond comprehension to evaluation. Pupils are expected not merely to understand what texts mean, but to analyse how they produce their effects and to assess their quality and significance.

#### The Study of Literature

The curriculum requires that pupils be taught to:

- Make critical comparisons across texts
- Study setting, plot, and characterisation, and the effects of these
- Understand how the work of dramatists is communicated effectively through performance and how alternative staging allows for different interpretations of a play
- Study a range of authors, including at least two authors in depth each year

The requirement to study "at least two authors in depth each year" establishes a minimum expectation for depth of study, ensuring that pupils have opportunities for detailed engagement with literary texts rather than only superficial coverage.

## Statutory Requirements: Writing

### Writing for Different Purposes and Audiences

The National Curriculum requires that at Key Stage 3, pupils should be taught to **write accurately, fluently, effectively and at length for pleasure and information**. This overarching requirement encompasses several specific purposes for writing:

#### Writing for a Wide Range of Purposes and Audiences

The curriculum requires that pupils write for:

- **Pleasure**: This includes creative writing, personal writing, and writing that expresses or explores ideas and experiences. The requirement to write "for pleasure" recognises that writing can be intrinsically rewarding, not merely a functional skill.

- **Information**: This includes explanatory writing, instructional writing, and informative non-fiction genres. The requirement to write "for information" establishes the importance of writing that communicates clearly and efficiently.

The reference to "a wide range of purposes and audiences" implies that pupils should experience writing in different genres and registers, adapting their language and style to suit different contexts.

#### Specific Writing Requirements

The curriculum sets out specific types of writing that pupils must practise:

- **Stories, scripts, poetry and other imaginative writing**: This creative writing requirement recognises the importance of developing pupils' imaginative and expressive capacities. The reference to "scripts" specifically requires that pupils engage with dramatic writing, connecting to the drama requirements in reading.

- **Notes and polished scripts for talks and presentations**: This requirement connects writing to speaking, recognising that effective presentations often require preparation and scripting. The distinction between "notes" and "polished scripts" recognises that different speaking contexts require different levels of preparation.

- **A range of other narrative and non-narrative texts, including arguments, and personal and formal letters**: This requirement ensures breadth in writing experience, encompassing persuasive writing (arguments), personal correspondence, and formal communication.

### Writing Skills and Strategies

The curriculum sets out specific requirements for the skills and strategies pupils should develop:

#### Planning, Drafting, Editing and Proofreading

Pupils should be taught to:

- **Plan their writing**: This involves considering audience and purpose, selecting appropriate forms, and organising content effectively.

- **Draft their writing**: This involves getting ideas down on paper, developing and connecting ideas, and experimenting with language and style.

- **Edit their writing**: This involves reviewing and revising, considering how well the writing achieves its purposes and how it might be improved. The curriculum specifies that editing should include "assessing the effectiveness of their own and others' writing."

- **Proofread their writing**: This involves checking for errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar, and making corrections.

#### Vocabulary, Grammar and Punctuation

The curriculum requires that pupils pay attention to these aspects of writing:

- **Vocabulary**: Pupils should "consider how their writing reflects the audiences and purposes for which it was intended" through their vocabulary choices.

- **Grammar**: Pupils should "consolidate and build on their knowledge of grammar and vocabulary through... the consideration of grammar and vocabulary when analysing texts."

- **Punctuation**: Pupils should be taught to use punctuation correctly and effectively.

- **Spelling**: Pupils should be taught to "spell correctly" and to "increase [their] knowledge of regular patterns of spelling, prefixes and suffixes, and of the origins of words."

## Statutory Requirements: Grammar and Vocabulary

The Key Stage 3 programme of study includes specific statutory requirements for grammar and vocabulary that build upon the foundations established at Key Stages 1 and 2.

### Grammar

Pupils should be taught to:

- **Consolidate and build on their knowledge of grammar and vocabulary** through extending and applying the grammatical knowledge set out in English Appendix 2 (Vocabulary, Grammar and Punctuation) to the Key Stages 1 and 2 programmes of study

- **Draw on new vocabulary and grammatical constructions from their reading and listening**, and use these consciously in their writing and speech to achieve particular effects

These requirements establish that grammar should be taught both explicitly (as knowledge about language) and implicitly (through reading and writing). The reference to using grammatical constructions "consciously" to "achieve particular effects" establishes that grammar is not merely a matter of correctness but a resource for meaning-making.

### Vocabulary

Pupils should be taught to:

- **Understand and use age-appropriate vocabulary**, including linguistic and literary terminology for discussing their reading, writing and spoken language

- **Know and understand the differences between spoken and written language**, including differences associated with formal and informal registers, and between Standard English and other varieties of English

The requirement to use "linguistic and literary terminology" establishes that pupils should develop a metalanguage for talking about language and literature. This includes terms for word classes (noun, verb, adjective, etc.), sentence structures, literary devices (metaphor, simile, alliteration, etc.), and textual features.

The requirement to understand differences between spoken and written language, and between formal and informal registers, recognises that language use is context-dependent and that effective communication requires awareness of these contexts.

### Knowledge About Language

The grammar and vocabulary requirements are underpinned by an expectation that pupils will develop explicit knowledge about how language works. This includes:

- Understanding of word classes (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, determiners)
- Understanding of sentence structure (clauses, phrases, sentence types)
- Understanding of punctuation and its functions
- Understanding of vocabulary development (etymology, morphology, word families)
- Understanding of register, formality, and audience

## Spoken Language at Key Stage 3

While there is no separate programme of study for spoken language at Key Stage 3, the National Curriculum includes expectations for spoken language development within the three statutory areas. Teachers should ensure that pupils:

### Participate in Discussions and Presentations

- Make formal presentations and speak in a range of contexts
- Use discussion to elaborate and explain their understanding and ideas
- Participate in debates, demonstrating an ability to argue a point and respond to counter-arguments

### Develop Oracy Skills

- Speak audibly and fluently with an increasing command of Standard English
- Gain, maintain and monitor the interest of the listener(s)
- Consider and evaluate different viewpoints, attending to and building on the contributions of others
- Select and use appropriate registers for effective communication

### Drama and Performance

Through their reading and writing, pupils should also develop their understanding of how dramatic performance communicates meaning. The requirements to study whole plays, including two Shakespeare plays, and to write scripts, provide contexts for dramatic performance.

## Assessment and Progression

### Assessment Arrangements

At Key Stage 3, there are no statutory national tests for English. Schools are responsible for assessing pupils' progress against the National Curriculum requirements. The Department for Education expects schools to have robust assessment arrangements in place to:

- Track pupils' progress in reading, writing, and grammar/vocabulary
- Identify pupils who are falling behind and provide appropriate support
- Ensure that all pupils make appropriate progress towards the demands of GCSE English

### Progression to Key Stage 4

The KS3 programme of study is designed to prepare pupils for GCSE English Language and English Literature. The GCSE specifications build directly upon the KS3 requirements:

- **GCSE English Language** requires pupils to read and analyse unseen texts, to write for different purposes and audiences, and to demonstrate competence in spoken language
- **GCSE English Literature** requires pupils to study whole texts (including a Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, a modern text, and poetry), demonstrating knowledge and understanding and analysing writers' methods

Schools must ensure that their KS3 curriculum provides the foundations for GCSE success, including developing the reading stamina, writing fluency, and analytical skills that GCSEs demand.

## Pedagogical Implications

### Teaching Reading

The statutory requirements for reading have several implications for pedagogy:

- **Whole-class reading**: The requirement to study whole texts and to study at least two authors in depth each year suggests that whole-class study of shared texts should be a central component of the KS3 English curriculum.

- **Independent reading**: The requirement to read widely implies that pupils need opportunities for independent reading, supported by well-stocked libraries and guidance on text selection.

- **Reading aloud**: The requirements for spoken language and drama suggest that reading aloud—both by teachers and pupils—should remain important at KS3, particularly for experiencing poetry and drama.

- **Explicit vocabulary instruction**: The vocabulary requirements imply that teachers should attend explicitly to vocabulary development, including teaching academic and literary vocabulary.

### Teaching Writing

The writing requirements imply a process-oriented approach:

- **Teaching the writing process**: The requirements to plan, draft, edit, and proofread imply that writing should be taught as a process, not merely as a product. Pupils need instruction in each phase of the writing process.

- **Modelling**: The requirement to write in a range of forms for different purposes suggests that teachers should model effective writing, making explicit the decisions writers make.

- **Scaffolded practice**: The requirement to write "at length" implies that pupils need extended opportunities for writing, with appropriate scaffolding to enable success with challenging tasks.

### Teaching Grammar and Vocabulary

The grammar and vocabulary requirements have specific pedagogical implications:

- **Contextualised grammar teaching**: The requirement to draw grammatical knowledge from reading and apply it to writing suggests that grammar should be taught in context, as far as possible, rather than as an isolated component.

- **Explicit terminology**: The requirement to use "linguistic and literary terminology" implies that teachers should explicitly teach and expect pupils to use technical terms for discussing language and literature.

- **Etymology and word formation**: The reference to "origins of words" and "prefixes and suffixes" suggests that word study should include attention to morphology and etymology.

## Ofsted Research Review: Implications for KS3

Ofsted's 2022 Curriculum Research Review: English examined the factors that contribute to high-quality English provision. While not statutory, this review provides guidance on effective implementation of the National Curriculum requirements.

### Reading

The review found that high-quality English curricula:

- Prioritise the teaching of reading, recognising that reading proficiency underpins access to the whole curriculum
- Use high-quality texts that are worth reading closely and re-reading
- Teach reading explicitly, including strategies for comprehension and analysis
- Ensure that pupils read widely and often, both in and beyond the classroom

For KS3, the review emphasised the importance of ensuring that pupils who enter secondary school without secure reading skills receive effective support to catch up, noting that "when pupils enter key stages 2 and 3 unable to read fluently, they are not always supported well enough to be able to catch up quickly."

### Writing

The review found that high-quality curricula:

- Teach writing explicitly, including the processes involved in planning, drafting, and revising
- Provide rich models of effective writing
- Give pupils extended opportunities for writing practice
- Teach grammar and vocabulary in ways that support writing development

The review noted that while teaching of reading had improved markedly in many schools, "curriculum for writing and spoken language" was often "less effective."

### Grammar and Vocabulary

The review emphasised the importance of explicit instruction in grammar and vocabulary, noting that:

- Teaching vocabulary explicitly supports reading comprehension
- Teaching grammar in context can support writing development
- Pupils need to build a rich vocabulary, including academic and literary terms

## Implementing the KS3 English Curriculum

### Curriculum Planning

Schools must plan their KS3 English curriculum to ensure full coverage of the statutory requirements while also providing coherence and progression. Effective curriculum planning should:

- Map out the texts to be studied to ensure coverage of genres, periods, and the required Shakespeare plays
- Plan for progression in writing skills across the three years
- Integrate grammar and vocabulary teaching with reading and writing
- Ensure opportunities for spoken language development

### Text Selection

The requirement for "high-quality works" gives schools significant autonomy in text selection. When selecting texts, schools should consider:

- **Challenge**: Texts should be sufficiently challenging to develop pupils' reading skills
- **Diversity**: The requirement for "wide coverage" suggests that texts should represent diverse voices and perspectives
- **Coherence**: While variety is important, there should also be coherence, with texts selected to enable meaningful connections and comparisons
- **Heritage and contemporary**: The curriculum requires both pre-1914 and contemporary literature, including Shakespeare and seminal world literature

### Supporting Pupils with Weak Literacy

The Ofsted review noted that some pupils enter KS3 without secure reading and writing skills. Schools must ensure that:

- Assessment identifies pupils who need additional support
- Interventions are provided to help pupils catch up
- The mainstream curriculum is adapted to ensure accessibility for all pupils

### Assessment

While there are no statutory assessments at KS3, schools should have robust assessment systems to:

- Monitor pupils' progress against the National Curriculum requirements
- Identify pupils who are falling behind
- Inform teaching and curriculum planning
- Prepare pupils for the demands of GCSE

## Conclusion

The Key Stage 3 English programme of study establishes a statutory framework for English education in Years 7, 8, and 9. Its requirements for reading (a wide range of fiction and non-fiction, including whole books, Shakespeare, and seminal world literature), writing (for different purposes and audiences, using the full writing process), and grammar and vocabulary (building on KS1 and KS2 foundations) provide the foundation for pupils' continuing English education and for their development as confident, articulate users of language.

Effective implementation of the KS3 curriculum requires careful curriculum planning, high-quality text selection, explicit teaching of reading and writing, and attention to the development of spoken language. When implemented effectively, the KS3 programme of study prepares pupils not only for the demands of GCSE English but for lifelong engagement with literature and for effective participation in society through confident use of spoken and written language.
