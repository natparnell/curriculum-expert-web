# EYFS English: Communication, Language and Literacy

## Introduction to English in the Early Years Foundation Stage

The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) framework recognises that communication, language, and literacy are fundamental to children's development and future academic success. The 2021 revision of the EYFS framework emphasises the primacy of communication and language, positioning it as the foundation upon which all other learning is built. As James Britton observed, "Reading and writing float on a sea of talk"—a principle that continues to guide effective early years practice today.

English in the EYFS is structured across two specific areas of learning: Communication and Language, and Literacy. These areas are deeply interconnected, with spoken language providing the essential foundation for reading and writing development. The EYFS framework is clear that "language comprehension only develops when adults talk with children about the world around them and the books (stories and non-fiction) they read with them, and enjoy rhymes, poems and songs together."

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the statutory expectations, developmental progression, pedagogical approaches, and teaching strategies associated with English in the EYFS. It draws upon the statutory EYFS framework (DfE, 2021), the non-statutory Development Matters guidance, and research-informed practice in early literacy development.

## The Statutory Framework: Early Learning Goals

### Communication and Language Early Learning Goal

The Communication and Language ELG is one of the prime areas of learning, reflecting its foundational importance. Children at the expected level of development will:

**Listening, Attention and Understanding:**
- Listen attentively and respond to what they hear with relevant questions, comments and actions when being read to and during whole class discussions and small group interactions
- Make comments about what they have heard and ask questions to clarify their understanding
- Hold conversation when engaged in back-and-forth exchanges with their teacher and peers

**Speaking:**
- Participate in small group, class and one-to-one discussions, offering their own ideas, using recently introduced vocabulary
- Offer explanations for why things might happen, making use of recently introduced vocabulary from stories, non-fiction, rhymes and poems when appropriate
- Express their ideas and feelings about their experiences using full sentences, including use of past, present and future tenses and making use of conjunctions, with modelling and support from their teacher

### Literacy Early Learning Goal

The Literacy ELG is divided into two components: Comprehension and Word Reading, and Writing.

**Comprehension:**
- Demonstrate understanding of what has been read to them by retelling stories and narratives using their own words and recently introduced vocabulary
- Anticipate (where appropriate) key events in stories
- Use and understand recently introduced vocabulary during discussions about stories, non-fiction, rhymes and poems

**Word Reading:**
- Say a sound for each letter in the alphabet and at least 10 digraphs
- Read words consistent with their phonic knowledge by sound-blending
- Read aloud simple sentences and books that are consistent with their phonic knowledge, including some common exception words

**Writing:**
- Write recognisable letters, most of which are correctly formed
- Spell words by identifying sounds in them and representing the sounds with a letter or letters
- Write simple phrases and sentences that can be read by others

## Development Matters: The Progression Framework

### Overview of Development Matters

Development Matters is non-statutory guidance that supports practitioners in implementing the EYFS. For communication, language, and literacy, the progression runs from birth through Reception, with three age bands: Birth to Three, Three and Four-Year-Olds, and Children in Reception.

### Communication and Language: Birth to Three

Even in the earliest years, children are developing foundational communication skills. Development Matters identifies key characteristics:

- **Birth to Speech (0-12 months):**
  - Quieten or alert to the sound of speech
  - Move their whole bodies to sounds they enjoy, including music
  - Express feelings such as discomfort, hunger, tiredness by crying, turning away or screwing up their face
  - Begin to make themselves understood through gestures and single words

- **Early Language (12-24 months):**
  - Begin to develop speech sounds and begin to say words
  - Understand some simple questions and instructions
  - Use single words and gesture to communicate
  - Begin to put 2 or 3 words together

- **Expanding Vocabulary (24-36 months):**
  - Understand simple questions about 'who', 'what' and 'where'
  - Use longer sentences of 4 to 6 words
  - Begin to ask simple questions
  - Use talk to organise themselves and their play

### Communication and Language: Three and Four-Year-Olds

In the nursery years, children's language develops rapidly. Development Matters highlights:

- **Listening and Attention:**
  - Listen to simple stories and understand what is happening, with the help of the pictures
  - Understand a question or instruction that has two parts
  - Listen to longer stories and can remember much of what happens
  - Pay attention to more than one thing at a time

- **Understanding:**
  - Understand 'why' questions
  - Understand simple questions about 'who', 'what' and 'where'
  - Understand use of objects (e.g., "Which do we use for cutting?")
  - Follow longer instructions

- **Speaking:**
  - Start a conversation with an adult or friend
  - Continue a conversation
  - Use longer sentences of 4 to 6 words
  - Begin to use word endings (e.g., "going", "cats")
  - Use talk to work out problems and organise thinking
  - Use new vocabulary in different contexts

### Communication and Language: Children in Reception

For children in Reception, Development Matters outlines the knowledge and understanding children should develop to meet the ELGs:

- **Listening and Attention:**
  - Listen attentively and respond to what they hear with relevant questions, comments and actions
  - Listen to and talk about stories to build familiarity and understanding
  - Be exposed to a wide vocabulary through conversations and discussions about the world around them

- **Understanding:**
  - Understand and follow instructions involving several ideas or actions
  - Answer 'how' and 'why' questions about their experiences
  - Make comments and ask questions about what they have heard

- **Speaking:**
  - Use talk to work out problems and organise thinking
  - Retell the story in their own words, once they have developed a deep familiarity with it
  - Participate in discussions, offering their own ideas
  - Use new vocabulary in different contexts
  - Use longer sentences of six or more words
  - Use past, present and future tense appropriately

### Literacy: Birth to Three

Early literacy foundations are laid long before formal schooling begins:

- **Early Reading Foundations (0-12 months):**
  - Enjoy looking at books and other printed material with familiar people
  - Respond to body language, facial expressions and tone of voice

- **Exploring Print (12-24 months):**
  - Handle books carefully, understanding that they are special
  - Enjoy rhymes and demonstrate listening by remaining still or joining in with actions
  - Point to pictures of familiar objects in books

- **Developing Interest (24-36 months):**
  - Handle books with increasing care, understanding that they are read from front to back
  - Understand that print has meaning
  - Begin to develop phonological awareness through songs and rhymes
  - Recognise familiar letters such as those in their name

### Literacy: Three and Four-Year-Olds

In the nursery years, literacy development accelerates:

- **Comprehension:**
  - Enjoy an increasing range of books
  - Know that print carries meaning and is read from left to right and top to bottom
  - Develop play that involves using reading and writing in different forms
  - Begin to retell stories, using pictures as prompts

- **Word Reading:**
  - Develop phonological awareness through activities such as singing, rhyming and clapping out syllables
  - Begin to recognise some letters and the sounds they represent
  - Show awareness of rhyme and alliteration

- **Writing:**
  - Use some of their print and letter knowledge in their early writing
  - Write some letters accurately
  - Make up stories, play scenarios and building that involve reading and writing

### Literacy: Children in Reception

For children in Reception, Development Matters provides detailed guidance on literacy development:

- **Comprehension:**
  - Understand and participate in discussions about stories, non-fiction, rhymes and poems
  - Use talk to help work out problems and organise thinking and activities
  - Retell the story, once they have developed a deep familiarity with the text
  - Learn new vocabulary through reading and talking about books

- **Word Reading:**
  - Say a sound for each letter in the alphabet and at least 10 digraphs
  - Read words consistent with their phonic knowledge by sound-blending
  - Read aloud simple sentences and books that are consistent with their phonic knowledge

- **Writing:**
  - Write recognisable letters, most of which are correctly formed
  - Spell words by identifying sounds in them and representing the sounds with a letter or letters
  - Write simple phrases and sentences that can be read by others

## Phonics in the EYFS

### Phase 1 Phonics: Foundations

Phase 1 phonics, outlined in the Letters and Sounds framework, focuses on developing children's speaking and listening skills and awareness of sounds in the environment. It is designed to be taught throughout the EYFS, beginning in nursery.

Phase 1 is divided into seven aspects:

1. **Environmental Sounds:** Helping children to develop awareness of sounds around them
2. **Instrumental Sounds:** Exploring sounds made by musical instruments and other objects
3. **Body Percussion:** Using the body to make sounds (clapping, stamping, clicking)
4. **Rhythm and Rhyme:** Enjoying and recognising rhymes and rhythmic patterns
5. **Alliteration:** Recognising words that start with the same sound
6. **Voice Sounds:** Exploring the different sounds that can be made with the voice
7. **Oral Blending and Segmenting:** Hearing sounds in words and putting sounds together

Phase 1 activities are designed to be playful and engaging, integrated throughout the daily routine. They include games such as:
- Sound walks around the setting or local environment
- Making music with instruments
- Action songs and rhymes
- Playing with words and sounds
- Sound lotto and matching games

### Phase 2-4 Phonics: Systematic Synthetic Phonics

From Reception, children typically begin systematic synthetic phonics programmes such as:
- Letters and Sounds (revised 2021)
- Read Write Inc.
- Jolly Phonics
- Bug Club Phonics

These programmes teach children to:
- Learn letter-sound correspondences (grapheme-phoneme correspondences)
- Blend sounds together to read words
- Segment words into sounds for spelling
- Read and write common exception words (tricky words)

The EYFS framework expects that by the end of Reception, children will be able to say a sound for each letter in the alphabet and at least 10 digraphs (such as sh, th, ch, ng, ai, ee, igh, oa, oo, ar).

## Early Reading Development

### The Simple View of Reading

The Simple View of Reading, which underpins the National Curriculum and early reading instruction, identifies two essential components:

1. **Word Reading (Decoding):** The ability to read words accurately and fluently
2. **Language Comprehension:** The ability to understand spoken language

Both components are necessary for reading comprehension. A child who can decode words but has poor language comprehension will struggle to understand what they read. Conversely, a child with good language comprehension but poor decoding skills will also struggle to access text.

### Developing Language Comprehension

Language comprehension develops through:

**Conversations and Discussion:**
- Adults talking with children about the world around them
- Back-and-forth exchanges that extend children's thinking
- Introducing and explaining new vocabulary

**Reading Aloud:**
- Sharing stories, non-fiction, rhymes, and poems
- Talking about books before, during, and after reading
- Retelling stories in children's own words

**Play and Exploration:**
- Role-play that extends vocabulary and understanding
- Opportunities to express ideas and feelings
- Collaborative play that requires negotiation and explanation

### Developing Word Reading

Word reading develops through systematic phonics instruction, supported by:

**Phonological Awareness:**
- Recognising and producing rhymes
- Identifying initial sounds in words
- Clapping syllables
- Blending and segmenting sounds

**Grapheme-Phoneme Correspondence:**
- Learning the sounds represented by letters
- Learning digraphs and trigraphs
- Recognising that the same sound can be represented in different ways

**Blending for Reading:**
- Putting sounds together to read words
- Beginning with simple VC (vowel-consonant) and CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant) words
- Progressing to longer words with adjacent consonants and vowel digraphs

**Common Exception Words:**
- Words that cannot be fully decoded using phonics (e.g., the, said, was, you)
- Learning to read these words by sight
- Understanding that these words have unusual spellings

## Early Writing Development

### Stages of Writing Development

Children's writing develops through recognisable stages:

**Stage 1: Mark Making (Ages 2-3)**
- Children make marks on paper that are not yet related to writing
- Marks may be scribbles, patterns, or drawings
- Children explore the physical act of making marks

**Stage 2: Symbolic Writing (Ages 3-4)**
- Children begin to understand that marks can represent meaning
- They may assign meaning to their marks ("This says Mummy")
- Letter-like forms begin to appear

**Stage 3: Emergent Writing (Ages 4-5)**
- Children use letters to represent sounds in words
- They may write their name and familiar words
- Letters may not be correctly formed or oriented

**Stage 4: Phonetic Writing (Age 5+)**
- Children spell words by representing the sounds they hear
- They use phonics knowledge to encode words
- Writing becomes more readable by others

### Supporting Early Writing

Effective practice for supporting early writing includes:

**Physical Development:**
- Developing fine motor skills through play (dough, construction, threading)
- Building hand strength and coordination
- Teaching correct pencil grip

**Meaningful Contexts:**
- Providing reasons to write (lists, messages, labels, stories)
- Role-play areas that require writing
- Opportunities to see adults writing for real purposes

**Phonics for Spelling:**
- Teaching children to segment words into sounds
- Supporting children to represent sounds with letters
- Introducing common spellings for sounds

**Letter Formation:**
- Teaching correct formation of letters
- Providing multi-sensory experiences (sand, paint, large movements)
- Ensuring children can form letters before requiring extensive writing

### Mark Making to Writing

The journey from mark making to conventional writing involves:

**Physical Skills:**
- Developing the gross and fine motor skills needed for writing
- Building core strength and shoulder stability
- Developing finger dexterity and pencil control

**Conceptual Understanding:**
- Understanding that writing carries meaning
- Understanding that writing represents spoken language
- Understanding the left-to-right, top-to-bottom orientation of English writing

**Linguistic Knowledge:**
- Developing phonological awareness
- Learning letter-sound correspondences
- Building vocabulary and understanding of sentence structure

## Pedagogical Approaches for EYFS English

### The Role of the Adult

Adults play a crucial role in developing children's communication, language, and literacy. Effective adult interactions include:

**Quality Interactions:**
- Engaging in sustained shared thinking
- Using open-ended questions that extend thinking
- Modelling correct language forms
- Introducing new vocabulary in context

**Reading Aloud:**
- Sharing books with enthusiasm and expression
- Discussing stories, characters, and events
- Introducing non-fiction, rhymes, and poems
- Rereading favourite books to build familiarity

**Modelling Writing:**
- Writing in front of children for real purposes
- Thinking aloud about spelling and letter formation
- Demonstrating the writing process

### The Importance of Talk

As the EEF Teaching and Learning Toolkit demonstrates, communication and language approaches have a high impact on learning. Effective practice includes:

**Back-and-Forth Interactions:**
- Following children's interests and extending their contributions
- Using contingent talk (responding to what children say and do)
- Avoiding excessive questioning
- Allowing thinking time

**Language-Rich Environments:**
- Labelling the environment
- Providing opportunities for talk throughout the day
- Using songs, rhymes, and stories to develop vocabulary

### Play-Based Learning

The EYFS framework emphasises that learning should be play-based and child-initiated. For English, this means:

**Role-Play:**
- Providing opportunities for imaginative play that extends vocabulary
- Creating role-play areas that encourage reading and writing (shops, post offices, restaurants)
- Supporting children to develop narratives through play

**Story Play:**
- Using small world play to retell and invent stories
- Acting out stories through drama and movement
- Using puppets and props to support storytelling

**Mark Making:**
- Providing opportunities for mark making in all areas of provision
- Offering a range of tools and surfaces (chalk, paint, sand, tablets)
- Celebrating all marks as meaningful communication

### The Learning Environment

An environment that supports communication, language, and literacy includes:

**Book Areas:**
- Comfortable, inviting spaces for reading
- A wide range of books (stories, non-fiction, poetry)
- Books that reflect children's interests and experiences
- Books that reflect diversity

**Writing Areas:**
- Resources for writing (paper, pencils, envelopes, labels)
- Materials for different types of writing
- Opportunities to write in different contexts

**Print-Rich Environment- Labels and signs throughout the setting
- Opportunities to see print in use
- Environmental print that is meaningful to children

## Assessment and Observation

### The EYFS Profile

At the end of Reception, teachers complete the EYFS Profile, assessing children against the Early Learning Goals. For Communication and Language, and Literacy, this involves making holistic judgements based on observations and interactions throughout the year.

The EYFS Profile uses a three-point scale:
- **Emerging:** Not yet at the expected level
- **Expected:** Meeting the expected level
- **Exceeding:** Beyond the expected level

### Observation and Assessment Strategies

Effective assessment in EYFS English relies on:

- **Ongoing Observation:** Watching children in their play and activities to see what they can do
- **Interactions:** Talking with children about their learning
- **Documentation:** Recording examples of children's communication and literacy behaviour
- **Assessment for Learning:** Using assessment to inform planning and teaching

Development Matters is clear that assessment should not be through formal testing but should be "based on observational evidence, and on the practitioner's knowledge of the child."

### Identifying Children at Risk

Early identification of children at risk of falling behind is crucial. Practitioners should be alert to:

- Children who have limited vocabulary for their age
- Children who struggle to follow instructions
- Children who have difficulty producing clear speech
- Children who show little interest in books or stories
- Children who struggle with phonological awareness tasks

The Nuffield Early Language Intervention (NELI) is an evidence-based programme designed to improve the spoken language ability of children during the transition from Reception to Year 1.

## Transition to Key Stage 1

### Continuity from EYFS to Year 1

The EYFS provides foundations for the Key Stage 1 National Curriculum. Key areas of continuity include:

- Phonics: Continuing systematic synthetic phonics programmes
- Reading: Moving from phonically decodable books to broader range
- Writing: Developing transcription and composition skills
- Spoken Language: Continuing to develop vocabulary and grammar

### Supporting Transition

Effective transition practices include:

- Sharing information about children's attainment and characteristics of learning
- Ensuring Year 1 teachers understand EYFS pedagogy
- Gradually introducing more formal learning approaches
- Maintaining opportunities for play and exploration
- Continuing to prioritise communication and language

### The Year 1 Phonics Screening Check

At the end of Year 1, children take the Phonics Screening Check, which assesses their ability to decode words using phonics. The EYFS literacy expectations are designed to ensure children are well-prepared for this assessment, with the word reading ELG aligned with the skills required.

## Common Challenges and Strategies

### Supporting Children with English as an Additional Language (EAL)

For children learning English as an additional language:
- Value and build upon children's home languages
- Provide visual support and real objects to aid understanding
- Use gesture, mime, and demonstration
- Provide opportunities for children to hear language in context before expecting production
- Work closely with families to support language development

### Supporting Children with Speech, Language and Communication Needs (SLCN)

With 1 in 5 children starting school with speech and language delays:
- Use visual supports and gestures
- Simplify language and break instructions into steps
- Provide additional time for processing and response
- Model correct language forms without requiring repetition
- Work with speech and language therapists where involved

### Closing the Vocabulary Gap

Research shows significant differences in vocabulary size between children from different backgrounds by age five. Strategies to close the gap include:
- Reading aloud regularly using a wide range of vocabulary
- Explaining word meanings explicitly
- Providing rich, language-rich experiences
- Encouraging conversations that extend children's contributions
- Using songs, rhymes, and stories to introduce new words

## Conclusion

English in the EYFS is founded on the understanding that communication, language, and literacy are deeply interconnected. The 2021 EYFS framework emphasises the primacy of spoken language as the foundation for reading and writing. By the end of Reception, children should have developed secure foundations in communication and language, be able to read simple sentences using phonics, and be able to write recognisable letters and simple phrases.

Effective teaching in the EYFS priorities:
- High-quality interactions that extend children's language
- Reading aloud and discussing books
- Systematic phonics instruction
- Meaningful opportunities for writing
- Play-based learning that embeds literacy in engaging contexts

The foundations laid in the EYFS have lasting impact on children's literacy attainment. Children who develop strong communication, language, and literacy skills in the early years are better placed to succeed in reading and writing throughout their school careers and beyond.
