# Key Stage 2 English: Statutory Content and Teaching Guidance

## Introduction to KS2 English

Key Stage 2 (Years 3, 4, 5 and 6) represents a crucial phase in pupils' English education, building on the foundations established in Key Stage 1 and preparing students for the transition to secondary education. The National Curriculum for English at KS2 is designed to ensure that all pupils develop increasing sophistication in reading, writing, and spoken language, establishing the competencies needed for future academic success and full participation in society.

The 2014 National Curriculum for English at Key Stage 2 significantly raises expectations compared to the previous curriculum. It establishes detailed programmes of study for reading (word reading and comprehension), writing (transcription and composition), and spoken language. Two statutory appendices—Appendix 1 (Spelling) and Appendix 2 (Vocabulary, Grammar and Punctuation)—provide detailed year-by-year specifications of what should be taught.

By the end of Key Stage 2, pupils are expected to read fluently and with good understanding, write clearly and accurately for a range of purposes and audiences, and speak confidently and effectively in a variety of contexts. These expectations reflect the importance of English as both a subject in its own right and the medium through which learning across the curriculum takes place.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the statutory content, pedagogical approaches, progression expectations, and assessment arrangements associated with Key Stage 2 English education.

## The Structure of KS2 English

### Three Interconnected Strands

The KS2 English curriculum maintains the three-strand structure from KS1, with increasing sophistication:

**Reading:** Divided into word reading (decoding) and comprehension (understanding)

**Writing:** Divided into transcription (spelling and handwriting) and composition (articulating ideas and structuring them in speech and writing)

**Spoken Language:** Encompassing speaking and listening skills that underpin literacy development

The National Curriculum emphasises that these strands are interdependent, with development in one area supporting development in the others. Effective teaching makes explicit connections between reading, writing, and spoken language.

### Statutory Appendices

Two statutory appendices provide detailed content specifications:

**Appendix 1: Spelling:** Specifies spelling rules, patterns, and word lists for each year group, building systematically from KS1 foundations

**Appendix 2: Vocabulary, Grammar and Punctuation:** Details grammatical terms, concepts, and punctuation marks to be taught in each year group, along with terminology for pupils

## Reading at Key Stage 2

### Word Reading

By Key Stage 2, most pupils should have secured the phonics foundations needed for fluent reading. The focus shifts from learning to read to reading to learn, though ongoing support for decoding remains important for some pupils.

**Year 3 and 4 Word Reading:**
Pupils should be taught to:
- Apply their growing knowledge of root words, prefixes and suffixes (etymology and morphology) as listed in English Appendix 1, both to read aloud and to understand the meaning of new words they meet
- Read further exception words, noting the unusual correspondences between spelling and sound, and where these occur in the word
- Attempt pronunciation of unfamiliar words drawing on prior knowledge of similar looking words
- Re-read and read ahead to check for meaning

**Year 5 and 6 Word Reading:**
Pupils should be taught to:
- Apply their growing knowledge of root words, prefixes and suffixes (morphology and etymology), as listed in English Appendix 1, both to read aloud and to understand the meaning of new words they meet
- Continue to read further exception words, noting the unusual correspondences between spelling and sound, and where these occur in the word
- Continue to read challenging material and increase their stamina as readers

### Reading Comprehension

**Year 3 and 4 Comprehension:**
Pupils should be taught to:

## Assessment at Key Stage 2

### Key Stage 2 Tests

At the end of Key Stage 2 (Year 6), pupils take statutory national curriculum tests in:
- English grammar, punctuation and spelling
- English reading

These tests provide information about how pupils are progressing compared to national standards.

### Teacher Assessment

In addition to the tests, teachers assess pupils' writing against the Teacher Assessment Frameworks. Pupils are assessed as working towards the expected standard, working at the expected standard, or working at greater depth within the expected standard.

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Developing Reading Comprehension

Effective teaching of reading comprehension at KS2 includes:
- Daily reading aloud to pupils
- Teaching comprehension strategies explicitly (predicting, questioning, clarifying, summarising)
- Developing vocabulary systematically
- Building background knowledge
- Promoting reading for pleasure
- Using a wide range of high-quality texts

### Teaching Writing

Effective writing teaching at KS2 involves:
- Modelling the writing process
- Using high-quality texts as models
- Providing opportunities for extended writing
- Teaching grammar in context
- Using talk to support writing
- Giving focused feedback

### Developing Spoken Language

Developing spoken language at KS2 involves:
- Creating opportunities for discussion and debate
- Teaching discussion skills explicitly
- Using drama and role-play
- Encouraging formal presentations
- Modelling Standard English

## Conclusion

The Key Stage 2 English curriculum provides a comprehensive foundation for literacy development. By the end of KS2, pupils should be fluent, confident readers; competent writers for a range of purposes; and effective speakers and listeners. The curriculum's emphasis on reading for pleasure, writing for real purposes, and developing spoken language ensures that pupils are prepared for the demands of secondary education and beyond.

Effective teaching requires:
- High-quality texts that engage and challenge pupils
- Systematic teaching of spelling, grammar, and punctuation
- Opportunities for extended writing
- Development of reading comprehension strategies
- Support for spoken language development
- Assessment that informs teaching

By the end of Key Stage 2, pupils should have developed the literacy skills that will support their learning across the curriculum and throughout their lives.
## Cross-Curricular Literacy

The National Curriculum emphasises that literacy skills developed in English are applied across the curriculum:

**Reading:**
Pupils read textbooks, instructions, and information texts in other subjects, applying their reading skills in different contexts and engaging with subject-specific vocabulary.

**Writing:**
Pupils write for different purposes across the curriculum—recording in science, describing in geography, explaining in history, and analysing in mathematics. Each subject has its own conventions and genres that pupils must learn.

**Vocabulary:**
Subject-specific vocabulary is taught and reinforced across the curriculum, building pupils' academic vocabulary and enabling them to engage with disciplinary knowledge.

**Spoken Language:**
Discussion and debate across subjects develops pupils' ability to use language for learning, to articulate thinking, and to engage with complex ideas.

This cross-curricular approach recognises that literacy is not confined to English lessons but is fundamental to learning across all subjects. Teachers across the curriculum have a responsibility to support literacy development in their subject contexts.

## Supporting Pupils with English as an Additional Language

The National Curriculum is clear that pupils for whom English is an additional language (EAL) must have opportunities to develop their use of English. At Key Stage 2, this includes:

**Continuing to Develop Home Language:**
Maintaining and developing the home language supports cognitive development and can facilitate additional language learning.

**Developing Academic Language:**
EAL pupils need explicit support to develop academic language proficiency—the language of schooling that is used in textbooks, examinations, and formal instruction.

**Scaffolding Learning:**
Visual support, modified texts, and collaborative activities can help EAL pupils access the curriculum while developing their English proficiency.

**Cognitive Challenge:**
EAL pupils should be challenged cognitively even while their English is developing. Language support should not mean curriculum simplification.

## Supporting Pupils with Special Educational Needs

The National Curriculum is a benchmark for all pupils, including those with special educational needs. At Key Stage 2:

**Access to the Curriculum:**
Pupils with SEN should access the same curriculum as their peers where possible, with appropriate support and scaffolding.

**Differentiation:**
Teachers may need to differentiate content, process, or product to meet individual needs while maintaining high expectations.

**Intervention:**
Targeted intervention may be needed for pupils who are not making expected progress, particularly in reading and writing.

**Assistive Technology:**
Technology can support access to the curriculum for some pupils with SEN, including text-to-speech software, speech-to-text software, and word prediction tools.

## The Role of Parents and Carers

Parents and carers continue to play a crucial role in supporting children's English development at Key Stage 2:

**Reading at Home:**
Continued reading aloud and discussion of books supports comprehension and vocabulary development. Parents can also model reading for pleasure.

**Supporting Writing:**
Authentic writing opportunities at home—lists, messages, stories, reviews—support children's understanding of writing purposes and audiences.

**Homework:**
Homework can provide opportunities for independent practice of skills learned at school, though it should not introduce new content.

**Communication with School:**
Regular communication between home and school supports consistent approaches and enables early identification of difficulties.

## Resources and Support

Several organisations provide resources and guidance for KS2 English teaching:

**The National Literacy Trust:**
Provides resources, research, and professional development for literacy teaching, including programmes to promote reading for pleasure.

**The Centre for Literacy in Primary Education (CLPE):**
Offers professional development and resources, particularly for teaching reading and writing through quality children's literature.

**The English Association:**
Provides resources, publications, and professional development for English teachers.

**The Chartered College of Teaching:**
Provides research summaries and professional development to support evidence-based practice.

## Transition to Key Stage 3

The transition from Key Stage 2 to Key Stage 3 is significant, with implications for English teaching:

**Increased Independence:**
Key Stage 3 expects greater independence in reading, writing, and research. Year 6 teachers can prepare pupils by gradually increasing independence.

**More Complex Texts:**
Key Stage 3 involves engagement with more complex, challenging texts. Developing reading stamina and comprehension strategies in Year 6 supports this transition.

**Different Teachers:**
Moving from a single class teacher to subject specialists requires pupils to adapt to different teaching styles and expectations.

**Secondary Literacy:**
Literacy demands increase across the curriculum at Key Stage 3. The foundations laid in English at Key Stage 2 support learning in all subjects.

Effective transition requires communication between primary and secondary schools, including the transfer of assessment information and discussion of individual pupils' needs.

## Quality First Teaching in English

Effective English teaching at Key Stage 2 is characterised by:

**High Expectations:**
Teachers communicate high expectations for all pupils, believing that every child can succeed in English with appropriate support.

**Quality Texts:**
Teachers use high-quality, engaging texts that challenge and inspire pupils, exposing them to rich language and diverse perspectives.

**Explicit Instruction:**
Teachers provide explicit instruction in reading, writing, and grammar, modelling processes and making thinking visible.

**Responsive Teaching:**
Teachers use assessment to identify pupils' needs and adjust teaching accordingly, providing additional support or challenge as needed.

**Engagement:**
Teachers create engaging, purposeful learning experiences that motivate pupils to read, write, and communicate.

**Talk:**
Teachers use talk effectively, both to model language and to enable pupils to articulate and develop their thinking.

## Conclusion: Preparing for Future Success

The Key Stage 2 English curriculum provides a comprehensive foundation for literacy development that prepares pupils for success at secondary school and beyond. By ensuring that pupils can read fluently and with understanding, write clearly and effectively for a range of purposes, and speak confidently and articulately, the curriculum equips them with essential skills for learning, work, and life.

The ambitious expectations of the 2014 National Curriculum require high-quality teaching that engages pupils, develops their skills systematically, and fosters a love of language and literature. When taught effectively, English at Key Stage 2 not only develops literacy skills but also cultivates imagination, empathy, critical thinking, and cultural understanding.

The ultimate goal is that all pupils leave primary school as confident, competent communicators who can use language effectively to learn, work, and participate fully in society. The Key Stage 2 English curriculum, supported by effective teaching, provides the foundation for achieving this goal.
