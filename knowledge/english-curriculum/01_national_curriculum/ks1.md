# Key Stage 1 English: Statutory Requirements

## Introduction

The Key Stage 1 (KS1) English programme of study applies to Years 1 and 2 in maintained schools in England. This foundational stage builds upon the early communication, language, and literacy skills developed in the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), establishing the core knowledge and skills that will be developed throughout primary education and beyond. The KS1 English curriculum is crucial because these early years represent a critical window for establishing secure foundations in reading and writing.

The overarching aim for English in the National Curriculum is "to promote high standards of language and literacy by equipping pupils with a strong command of the spoken and written language, and to develop their love of literature through widespread reading for enjoyment." At Key Stage 1, this translates into focused, systematic instruction in reading and writing, supported by continued development of spoken language.

Unlike at Key Stages 2 and 3, the KS1 programme of study is organised into two main areas—**Reading** and **Writing**—with spoken language development integrated across both. The phonics programme, typically completed by the end of Year 1, is central to the KS1 reading curriculum. By the end of Key Stage 1, pupils should be able to read age-appropriate texts fluently and write for a range of purposes.

This document provides a comprehensive account of the statutory requirements for Key Stage 1 English, drawing upon the official National Curriculum documentation, guidance from the Department for Education, Ofsted research on early reading and writing, and insights from literacy education research.

## Aims of the National Curriculum for English at KS1

The National Curriculum for English aims to ensure that by the end of Key Stage 1, all pupils:

1. **Read words accurately and fluently**: Through systematic phonics instruction, pupils learn to decode words accurately and develop increasing fluency.

2. **Develop reading comprehension**: Pupils learn to understand what they read, making sense of texts and beginning to make inferences.

3. **Write words and simple sentences accurately**: Using their phonics knowledge, pupils learn to encode words for writing and construct simple sentences.

4. **Develop a love of reading and writing**: Pupils encounter high-quality texts that engage their interest and inspire them as readers and writers.

5. **Use spoken language to communicate effectively**: Building on EYFS foundations, pupils continue to develop their ability to express themselves clearly and listen to others.

These aims recognise that Key Stage 1 is a crucial period for establishing the foundational skills that underpin all later learning. The focus is on accuracy and fluency in reading and writing, supported by rich experiences with literature and purposeful communication.

## Statutory Requirements: Reading

### Word Reading

The KS1 reading curriculum is built on systematic synthetic phonics, which provides the foundation for both reading and spelling. The statutory requirements for word reading are:

**Pupils should be taught to:**

- **Apply phonic knowledge and skills** as the route to decode words
- **Respond speedily with the correct sound** to graphemes (letters or groups of letters) for all 40+ phonemes, including, where applicable, alternative sounds for graphemes
- **Read accurately by blending sounds** in unfamiliar words containing GPCs (grapheme-phoneme correspondences) that have been taught
- **Read common exception words**, noting unusual correspondences between spelling and sound and where these occur in the word
- **Read words containing taught GPCs** and –s, –es, –ing, –ed, –er and –est endings
- **Read other words of more than one syllable** that contain taught GPCs
- **Read words with contractions** (e.g. I'm, I'll, we'll) and understand that the apostrophe represents the omitted letter(s)
- **Read aloud accurately books that are consistent with their developing phonic knowledge** and that do not require them to use other strategies to work out words
- **Re-read books to build up their fluency and confidence** in word reading

### Reading Comprehension

While phonics is essential for decoding, reading comprehension requires additional skills. The statutory requirements for reading comprehension at KS1 are:

**Pupils should be taught to:**

- **Develop pleasure in reading, motivation to read, vocabulary and understanding** by:
  - Listening to and discussing a wide range of poems, stories and non-fiction at a level beyond that at which they can read independently
  - Being encouraged to link what they read or hear to their own experiences
  - Becoming very familiar with key stories, fairy stories and traditional tales, retelling them and considering their particular characteristics
  - Recognising and joining in with predictable phrases
  - Learning to appreciate rhymes and poems, and to recite some by heart
  - Discussing word meanings, linking new meanings to those already known

- **Understand both the books they can already read accurately and fluently and those they listen to** by:
  - Drawing on what they already know or on background information and vocabulary provided by the teacher
  - Checking that the text makes sense to them as they read and correcting inaccurate reading
  - Discussing the significance of the title and events
  - Making inferences on the basis of what is being said and done
  - Predicting what might happen on the basis of what has been read so far
  - Participating in discussion about what is read to them, taking turns and listening to what others say
  - Explaining clearly their understanding of what is read to them

### The Phonics Screening Check

At the end of Year 1, pupils sit the phonics screening check, a statutory assessment designed to confirm whether individual pupils have learned phonic decoding to an appropriate standard. The check comprises:

- 40 words (20 real words and 20 pseudo-words or "alien words")
- Administered one-to-one by a teacher
- Assesses decoding of grapheme-phoneme correspondences
- Pupils who do not meet the standard retake the check in Year 2

The phonics screening check reinforces the importance of systematic phonics instruction and helps identify pupils who need additional support.

## Statutory Requirements: Writing

### Transcription (Spelling and Handwriting)

The writing curriculum at KS1 focuses on transcription—getting words on the page accurately—and composition—crafting meaning. The statutory requirements for transcription are:

**Spelling**

Pupils should be taught to:

- **Spell words containing each of the 40+ phonemes** already taught
- **Spell common exception words**
- **Spell days of the week**
- **Name the letters of the alphabet** (naming letters in order and distinguishing between name and sound)
- **Add prefixes and suffixes** (using the spelling rule for adding –s or –es as the plural marker for nouns and the third person singular marker for verbs, and the prefix un–)
- **Apply simple spelling rules and guidance**, as listed in English Appendix 1
- **Write from memory simple sentences** dictated by the teacher that include words using the GPCs, common exception words and punctuation taught so far

**Handwriting**

Pupils should be taught to:

- **Sit correctly at a table, holding a pencil comfortably and correctly**
- **Begin to form lower-case letters in the correct direction, starting and finishing in the right place** (Year 1)
- **Form capital letters** (Year 1)
- **Form digits 0-9** (Year 1)
- **Understand which letters belong to which handwriting 'families'** (i.e. letters that are formed in similar ways) and to practise these (Year 1)
- **Form lower-case letters of the correct size relative to one another** (Year 2)
- **Start using some of the diagonal and horizontal strokes needed to join letters** and understand which letters, when adjacent to one another, are best left unjoined (Year 2)
- **Write capital letters and digits of the correct size, orientation and relationship to one another and to lower-case letters** (Year 2)
- **Use spacing between words that reflects the size of the letters** (Year 2)

### Composition (Articulating Ideas and Structuring Them in Speech and Writing)

The composition requirements at KS1 focus on developing pupils' ability to express ideas in writing:

Pupils should be taught to:

- **Write sentences by:**
  - Saying out loud what they are going to write about
  - Composing a sentence orally before writing it
  - Sequencing sentences to form short narratives
  - Re-reading what they have written to check that it makes sense
  - Discussing what they have written with the teacher or other pupils
  - Read aloud their writing clearly enough to be heard by their peers and the teacher (Year 2)

- **Develop positive attitudes towards and stamina for writing** by:
  - Writing narratives about personal experiences and those of others (real and fictional)
  - Writing about real events
  - Writing poetry
  - Writing for different purposes (Year 2)

- **Consider what they are going to write before beginning** by:
  - Planning or saying out loud what they are going to write about
  - Writing down ideas and/or key words, including new vocabulary
  - Encapsulating what they want to say, sentence by sentence (Year 2)

- **Make simple additions, revisions and corrections to their own writing** by:
  - Evaluating their writing with the teacher and other pupils
  - Re-reading to check that their writing makes sense and that verbs to indicate time are used correctly and consistently, including verbs in the continuous form
  - Proof-reading to check for errors in spelling, grammar and punctuation (e.g. ends of sentences punctuated correctly) (Year 2)

- **Read aloud what they have written** with appropriate intonation to make the meaning clear (Year 2)

### Vocabulary, Grammar and Punctuation

Pupils should be taught to develop their understanding of the concepts set out in English Appendix 2 by:

**Year 1**
- **Word**: Regular plural noun suffixes –s or –es (e.g. dog, dogs; wish, wishes), including the effects of these suffixes on the meaning of the noun
- **Word**: Suffixes that can be added to verbs where no change is needed in the spelling of root words (e.g. helping, helped, helper)
- **Sentence**: How words can combine to make sentences
- **Text**: Joining words and joining clauses using and
- **Punctuation**: Sequencing sentences to form short narratives
- **Punctuation**: Separation of words with spaces
- **Punctuation**: Introduction to capital letters, full stops, question marks and exclamation marks to demarcate sentences
- **Punctuation**: Capital letters for names and for the personal pronoun I
- **Terminology**: Letter, capital letter, word, singular, plural, sentence, punctuation, full stop, question mark, exclamation mark

**Year 2**
- **Word**: Formation of nouns using suffixes such as –ness, –er and by compounding
- **Word**: Formation of adjectives using suffixes such as –ful, –less
- **Word**: Use of the suffixes –er, –est in adjectives and the use of –ly in Standard English to turn adjectives into adverbs
- **Sentence**: Subordination (using when, if, that, because) and coordination (using or, and, but)
- **Sentence**: Expanded noun phrases for description and specification (e.g. the blue butterfly, plain flour, the man in the moon)
- **Text**: How the grammatical patterns in a sentence indicate its function as a statement, question, exclamation or command
- **Text**: Correct choice and consistent use of present tense and past tense throughout writing
- **Text**: Use of the progressive form of verbs in the present and past tense to mark actions in progress (e.g. she is drumming, he was shouting)
- **Punctuation**: Use of capital letters, full stops, question marks and exclamation marks to demarcate sentences
- **Punctuation**: Commas to separate items in a list
- **Punctuation**: Apostrophes to mark where letters are missing in spelling and to mark singular possession in nouns (e.g. the girl's name)
- **Terminology**: Noun, noun phrase, statement, question, exclamation, command, compound, suffix, adjective, adverb, verb, tense (past, present), apostrophe, comma

## Spoken Language

While there is no separate programme of study for spoken language at Key Stage 1, the National Curriculum states that pupils should be taught to:

- **Listen and respond appropriately to adults and their peers**
- **Ask relevant questions to extend their understanding and knowledge**
- **Use relevant strategies to build their vocabulary**
- **Articulate and justify answers, arguments and opinions**
- **Give well-structured descriptions, explanations and narratives for different purposes, including for expressing feelings**
- **Maintain attention and participate actively in collaborative conversations, staying on topic and initiating and responding to comments**
- **Use spoken language to develop understanding through speculating, hypothesising, imagining and exploring ideas**
- **Speak audibly and fluently with an increasing command of Standard English**
- **Participate in discussions, presentations, performances, role play, improvisations and debates**
- **Gain, maintain and monitor the interest of the listener(s)**
- **Consider and evaluate different viewpoints, attending to and building on the contributions of others**
- **Select and use appropriate registers for effective communication**

These spoken language requirements are developed across the curriculum, not only in English lessons, and underpin both reading comprehension and writing development.

## Assessment at Key Stage 1

### Teacher Assessment

At the end of Key Stage 1, teachers assess pupils against teacher assessment frameworks for English. For 2023-24 onwards, these are used for internal assessment only, not for statutory reporting. The frameworks describe performance at the "expected standard" for reading and writing.

### Interim Standards (for reference)

The interim standards describe what pupils should be able to do to meet the expected standard:

**Reading**
- Read accurately words of two or more syllables
- Read words containing common suffixes
- Read most common exception words
- Read age-appropriate books with increasing fluency and expression
- Answer questions and make some inferences on the basis of what is being said and done

**Writing**
- Write simple, coherent narratives about personal experiences and those of others (real or fictional)
- Write about real events, recording these simply and clearly
- Demarcate most sentences accurately with capital letters and full stops
- Use capital letters for names and the personal pronoun I
- Write sentences that are usually grammatically accurate
- Spell most common exception words correctly
- Spell most words with contractions correctly
- Add suffixes to spell most words correctly in their writing (e.g. –ment, –ness, –ful, –less, –ly)
- Use the diagonal and horizontal strokes needed to join letters in some of their writing

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Systematic Synthetic Phonics

The foundation of reading and spelling instruction at KS1 is systematic synthetic phonics. Effective phonics teaching is:

- **Systematic**: Letters and sounds are taught in a planned, sequential order
- **Synthetic**: Sounds are blended (synthesised) to read words
- **Fast-paced**: Pupils progress quickly through the programme
- **Applied**: Phonics is practised in reading and writing activities
- **Assessed**: Regular assessment identifies pupils who need additional support

The Department for Education's "Letters and Sounds" programme (now archived) and validated systematic synthetic phonics programmes provide structured approaches.

### Reading for Pleasure

Alongside phonics instruction, pupils need rich experiences with literature:

- **Reading aloud**: Teachers reading high-quality texts to the class daily
- **Independent reading**: Pupils reading books matched to their phonic knowledge
- **Reading environment**: Classrooms filled with attractive, diverse books
- **Storytime**: Regular, protected time for enjoying stories together

Research consistently shows that reading for pleasure is the single most important indicator of a child's future success.

### Talk for Writing

Oral composition precedes and supports written composition:

- **Oral rehearsal**: Pupils say sentences before writing them
- **Shared writing**: Teachers model writing, thinking aloud about choices
- **Storytelling**: Learning and retelling stories builds narrative understanding
- **Vocabulary development**: Rich talk develops the vocabulary needed for writing

### The Simple View of Reading

The KS1 reading curriculum is informed by the Simple View of Reading, which proposes that:

Reading Comprehension = Decoding × Language Comprehension

Both components are necessary:
- **Decoding** (word recognition) is developed through phonics
- **Language comprehension** is developed through talk, listening to stories, and discussion

Effective teaching addresses both components systematically.

## Common Challenges

### Ensuring Phonics Attainment

Some pupils struggle to achieve the standard in the phonics screening check. Strategies include:

- **Additional daily phonics practice**: For pupils who are struggling
- **One-to-one tutoring**: Intensive support for the lowest attaining pupils
- **Regular assessment**: Identifying gaps in knowledge and targeting teaching
- **Parental involvement**: Supporting parents to help at home

### Building Writing Stamina

Young writers often struggle to write at length. Strategies include:

- **Scaffolded support**: Writing frames, word banks, and planning formats
- **Purposeful writing**: Giving writing real purposes and audiences
- **Oral composition**: Ensuring pupils can compose orally before writing
- **Gradual increase**: Building stamina over time with regular practice

### Supporting Struggling Readers

Not all pupils progress at the same rate. Support strategies include:

- **Daily reading practice**: Additional reading with an adult
- **Matched books**: Ensuring pupils read books at the right level
- **Comprehension support**: Teaching comprehension strategies explicitly
- **Engagement**: Finding books that capture interest and motivation

## Transition to Key Stage 2

### Building Secure Foundations

By the end of Key Stage 1, pupils should have:

- Secure phonics knowledge for reading and spelling
- Fluency in reading age-appropriate texts
- Ability to write simple narratives and non-fiction texts
- Basic command of grammar, punctuation, and spelling
- Confidence in spoken language

These foundations enable pupils to access the more demanding KS2 curriculum, where they will encounter longer texts, more complex writing tasks, and greater emphasis on independent reading and writing.

### Addressing Gaps

Pupils who have not achieved the expected standard by the end of Year 2 need targeted support:

- **Catch-up phonics**: For pupils who have not mastered decoding
- **Reading fluency interventions**: To build speed and accuracy
- **Writing support**: Scaffolds and frameworks to enable success
- **Continued monitoring**: Regular assessment to ensure gaps are closing

## Conclusion

Key Stage 1 English is a critical period for establishing the foundations of literacy. The National Curriculum provides a clear framework, with systematic phonics at its heart, supported by rich experiences of literature and purposeful writing opportunities. By the end of Year 2, pupils should be able to read with increasing fluency and confidence, and to write for a range of purposes with growing accuracy.

The statutory requirements balance the technical skills of decoding and encoding with the broader purposes of literacy—enjoying literature, communicating effectively, and developing a lifelong love of reading and writing. Teachers who maintain this balance, ensuring that phonics instruction is rigorous while also fostering reading for pleasure and writing for real purposes, give their pupils the best possible start in English.

As pupils transition to Key Stage 2, the foundations laid in Years 1 and 2 enable them to tackle more complex texts, develop as independent readers, and become increasingly skilled writers. The investment in early literacy pays dividends throughout pupils' educational careers and beyond.
