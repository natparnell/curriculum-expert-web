# The National Curriculum for English: Statutory Framework Overview

## Introduction and Legal Basis

The National Curriculum for English in England is established under the **Education Act 2002**, which requires that local authorities and governing bodies of maintained schools exercise their functions with a view to securing that the National Curriculum for England is implemented. This statutory duty applies to all **local-authority-maintained schools** in England, making the programmes of study legally binding unless there is a good reason not to follow them.

The current National Curriculum framework was introduced in **September 2014**, with the exception of English and mathematics, which came into force for all year groups from **September 2016**. The majority of this curriculum represents the most significant reform of the National Curriculum since its original introduction under the Education Reform Act 1988.

The statutory framework consists of two key documents that English subject leaders and teachers must understand:
1. **The National Curriculum Framework for Key Stages 1 to 4** — setting out overarching principles, inclusion requirements, and the structure of the curriculum
2. **The English Programmes of Study** — detailing subject-specific content, attainment targets, and statutory requirements for spoken language, reading, and writing across key stages 1 to 4

All schools maintained by the local authority must teach the programmes of study from the dates specified in statutory guidance. Academy schools and free schools are not legally required to follow the National Curriculum, though many choose to do so as a foundation for their own curricula.

## The Purpose of English in the National Curriculum

The **purpose of study** statement for English establishes its pre-eminent place in education and society. According to the Department for Education (DfE, 2014):

> "English has a pre-eminent place in education and in society. A high-quality education in English will teach pupils to speak and write fluently so that they can communicate their ideas and emotions to others, and through their reading and listening, others can communicate with them."

This statement reflects the dual nature of English as both a **subject in its own right** and the **medium for teaching** across the entire curriculum. The DfE emphasises that teachers should develop pupils' spoken language, reading, writing, and vocabulary as integral aspects of the teaching of every subject, not merely within discrete English lessons.

The purpose statement highlights several critical functions of English education:

### Cultural, Emotional, and Intellectual Development
Through reading, particularly engagement with literature, pupils have opportunities to develop culturally, emotionally, intellectually, socially, and spiritually. Literature plays a key role in this development by exposing pupils to diverse perspectives, historical contexts, and the richness of human experience.

### Knowledge Acquisition
Reading enables pupils both to acquire new knowledge and to build upon existing understanding. This positions literacy as fundamental to all learning—pupils who cannot read fluently face barriers across every subject area.

### Social Participation
The framework explicitly states that "all the skills of language are essential to participating fully as a member of society." It warns that pupils who do not learn to speak, read, and write fluently and confidently are effectively **disenfranchised**, denied full participation in democratic and civic life.

## The Seven Aims of the National Curriculum for English

The overarching aim for English in the National Curriculum is to **promote high standards of language and literacy** by equipping pupils with a strong command of the spoken and written word, and to develop their love of literature through widespread reading for enjoyment.

The National Curriculum specifies **seven specific aims** that all pupils should achieve:

### Aim 1: Fluent and Comprehending Reading
Pupils should **read easily, fluently, and with good understanding**. This aim establishes automaticity and comprehension as dual goals—reading instruction must address both accurate decoding and meaningful engagement with text.

### Aim 2: Habitual and Wide Reading
Pupils should **develop the habit of reading widely and often, for both pleasure and information**. The explicit inclusion of reading for pleasure reflects research evidence showing that reading frequency and enjoyment correlate strongly with attainment (Sullivan and Brown, 2013).

### Aim 3: Linguistic Knowledge
Pupils should **acquire a wide vocabulary, an understanding of grammar, and knowledge of linguistic conventions** for reading, writing, and spoken language. This aim encompasses explicit knowledge about language structure and use.

### Aim 4: Literary Heritage
Pupils should **appreciate our rich and varied literary heritage**. This controversial aim sparked debate during curriculum reform, with critics arguing it prioritises canonical texts over diverse contemporary literature. Defenders note that understanding literary tradition provides cultural capital and historical context.

### Aim 5: Clear and Adaptable Writing
Pupils should **write clearly, accurately, and coherently, adapting their language and style in and for a range of contexts, purposes, and audiences**. This aim emphasises writing as a versatile tool for communication across domains.

### Aim 6: Learning Through Discussion
Pupils should **use discussion in order to learn**, being able to elaborate and explain clearly their understanding and ideas. This positions oracy not merely as a performance skill but as a cognitive tool for learning.

### Aim 7: Competent Speaking and Listening
Pupils should be **competent in the arts of speaking and listening**, making formal presentations, demonstrating to others, and participating in debate. This aim addresses both presentational talk and exploratory dialogue.

## Structure Across Key Stages

The National Curriculum organises schooling into **four key stages**, with English as a core subject throughout:

| Key Stage | Age Range | Year Groups | End-of-Stage Assessment |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Key Stage 1** | 5–7 years | Years 1–2 | Teacher assessment; phonics screening check (Year 1) |
| **Key Stage 2** | 7–11 years | Years 3–6 | SATs (reading and grammar, punctuation, and spelling); teacher assessment (writing) |
| **Key Stage 3** | 11–14 years | Years 7–9 | Teacher assessment against National Curriculum levels (abolished 2014; schools now use their own systems) |
| **Key Stage 4** | 14–16 years | Years 10–11 | GCSE English Language and English Literature |

### Key Stage 1 (Ages 5–7)

Key Stage 1 represents a period of rapid development in word reading. The National Curriculum reflects this pace through **year-by-year programmes of study** for Years 1 and 2, rather than the two-year blocks used in Key Stage 2.

**Statutory content for Key Stage 1 English includes:**

- **Spoken language**: foundations for all other English learning
- **Reading**: word reading (decoding through phonics) and comprehension (listening and reading)
- **Writing**: transcription (spelling and handwriting) and composition (articulating ideas)

The **Year 1 phonics screening check** is a statutory assessment administered in June. Pupils who do not meet the expected standard in Year 1 must retake the check in Year 2. While not part of the National Curriculum itself, this assessment shapes early reading instruction significantly.

### Key Stage 2 (Ages 7–11)

Key Stage 2 programmes of study are organised in **two-year blocks** (Years 3–4 and Years 5–6), recognising that development continues but at a less rapid pace than in Key Stage 1.

**Key developments in Key Stage 2:**

- Continued emphasis on **word reading** for pupils who have not achieved fluency
- Increasing focus on **comprehension** of increasingly complex texts
- Development of **writing stamina** and ability to sustain composition over longer pieces
- **Statutory spelling word lists** for Years 3–4 and Years 5–6 (Appendix 1)
- Explicit grammar, punctuation, and vocabulary teaching (Appendix 2)

By the end of Key Stage 2, the National Curriculum states that "all pupils are able to read fluently, and with confidence, in any subject in their forthcoming secondary education." This represents a clear transition point—pupils entering secondary school should have moved from "learning to read" to "reading to learn."

### Key Stage 3 (Ages 11–14)

The Key Stage 3 programme of study for English (introduced 2014) represents a significant shift from the previous curriculum. It is structured around three strands:

1. **Reading**: critical reading, comprehension, and knowledge of literature
2. **Writing**: writing for a range of purposes and audiences, accurate grammar and punctuation
3. **Grammar and Vocabulary**: explicit knowledge about language structure and use

**Key features of the Key Stage 3 programme:**

- Pupils should read **whole books**, not merely extracts
- The curriculum specifies **two Shakespeare plays** to be studied across Key Stage 3
- Requirements for **pre-1914 literature** and **seminal world literature**
- **Prescribed poets** including representative Romantic poetry
- Explicit focus on **standard English** and formal register

The Key Stage 3 programme sparked debate about curriculum narrowing and the balance between canonical texts and contemporary diverse literature. The English Association (2022) criticised the Ofsted Research Review's interpretation of these requirements as overly prescriptive.

### Key Stage 4 (Ages 14–16)

At Key Stage 4, the National Curriculum for English is delivered through **GCSE specifications**. The statutory programme of study (added July 2014) sets minimum requirements that all awarding bodies must meet:

**GCSE English Language requirements:**
- Reading: comprehension and critical evaluation of fiction and non-fiction
- Writing: clear and coherent narratives, descriptions, and expositions
- Spoken language: formal presentation and response to questions

**GCSE English Literature requirements:**
- Study of **at least one play by Shakespeare**
- Study of **at least one 19th-century novel**
- Study of **poetry since 1789** (including Romantic poetry)
- Study of **fiction or drama from the British Isles from 1914 onwards**

Schools may offer English Language alone, or both English Language and English Literature. Most pupils take both qualifications, with English Literature providing the primary vehicle for meeting the statutory requirements for literary study.

## The Three Strands of English

The National Curriculum structures English into three interconnected strands, with spoken language providing the foundation for reading and writing development.

### Spoken Language

The National Curriculum reflects the importance of spoken language in pupils' development across the whole curriculum—**cognitively, socially, and linguistically**. The framework explicitly states:

> "Spoken language underpins the development of reading and writing."

**Statutory requirements for spoken language (Years 1–6):**

- Listen and respond appropriately to adults and peers
- Ask relevant questions to extend understanding and knowledge
- Use relevant strategies to build vocabulary
- Articulate and justify answers, arguments, and opinions
- Give well-structured descriptions, explanations, and narratives
- Participate actively in collaborative conversations
- Select and use appropriate registers for effective communication

**Drama requirements:**
- Adopt, create, and sustain a range of roles
- Improvise, devise, and script drama for various audiences
- Rehearse, refine, share, and respond thoughtfully to drama and theatre performances

The spoken language programme is unusual in that **no specific year-by-year content is prescribed**. Instead, teachers are expected to integrate spoken language development across reading and writing teaching, recognising that oracy underpins all literacy learning.

### Reading

The National Curriculum specifies two dimensions of reading at key stages 1 and 2:

#### Dimension 1: Word Reading
Skilled word reading involves:
- **Decoding**: the speedy working out of pronunciation of unfamiliar printed words
- **Sight recognition**: the speedy recognition of familiar printed words

The curriculum states clearly: "phonics should be emphasised in the early teaching of reading to beginners." This reflects the evidence base for systematic synthetic phonics as the most effective approach to early reading instruction (Rose Review, 2006).

#### Dimension 2: Comprehension
Good comprehension draws from:
- Linguistic knowledge (particularly vocabulary and grammar)
- Knowledge of the world

Comprehension develops through:
- High-quality discussion with teachers
- Reading and discussing a range of stories, poems, and non-fiction
- Wide reading across fiction and non-fiction

The curriculum emphasises that reading widely and often **increases pupils' vocabulary**, feeds their **imagination**, and opens up "a treasure house of wonder and joy for curious young minds."

### Writing

The programmes of study for writing mirror the structure of reading, with two dimensions:

#### Dimension 1: Transcription
- **Spelling**: knowing the relationship between sounds and letters (phonics) and understanding morphology and orthography
- **Handwriting**: fluent, legible, and eventually speedy handwriting

#### Dimension 2: Composition
- Articulating and communicating ideas
- Organising ideas coherently for a reader
- Clarity, audience awareness, purpose, and context

The curriculum integrates **planning, revising, and evaluating** within the composition strand, recognising writing as a recursive process rather than linear production.

## Attainment Targets

The National Curriculum specifies a single, overarching **attainment target** for English:

> "By the end of each key stage, pupils are expected to know, apply, and understand the matters, skills and processes specified in the relevant programme of study."

This represents a significant departure from the previous National Curriculum, which specified discrete level descriptors for each key stage. The 2014 reform abolished National Curriculum levels, leaving schools to develop their own assessment systems for tracking progress.

**Implications for assessment:**

- Schools must determine their own approaches to measuring progress toward the end-of-key-stage expectations
- Ofsted inspectors evaluate whether schools' assessment systems are "suitably challenging"
- The national assessment system retains summative checkpoints at Year 1 (phonics), Year 2 (end of Key Stage 1), Year 6 (end of Key Stage 2), and Year 11 (GCSE)

---

## Statutory Appendices

The English programmes of study include two statutory appendices that provide specific content requirements:

### Appendix 1: Spelling
- Word lists for Years 3–4 and Years 5–6 (statutory)
- Spelling rules and patterns to be taught
- Guidance on teaching spelling strategies

### Appendix 2: Vocabulary, Grammar, and Punctuation
- Content to be taught in each year group
- Terminology that pupils should learn (e.g., "noun," "verb," "prefix," "clause")
- Guidance on Standard English usage

A **non-statutory glossary** accompanies the programmes of study, providing definitions of grammatical terms for teachers.

---

## Implementation and School Flexibility

The National Curriculum framework provides some flexibility in implementation:

### Flexibility Within Key Stages
Schools are only required to teach the relevant programme of study **by the end of the key stage**. Within each key stage, schools have flexibility to:
- Introduce content earlier or later than set out in the programme of study
- Introduce key stage content during an earlier key stage if appropriate
- Set out their school curriculum for English on a year-by-year basis

### Non-Statutory Content
Schools are **not required by law** to teach:
- Example content shown in [square brackets]
- Content indicated as being 'non-statutory'

This allows teachers to select examples and contexts appropriate to their pupils while maintaining focus on statutory learning objectives.

### Curriculum Documentation
All schools are required to **set out their school curriculum for English on a year-by-year basis** and make this information available online. This requirement for transparency supports parental engagement and accountability.

## Progression Across Key Stages

Understanding how English learning progresses across key stages is essential for curriculum coherence.

### Early Reading to Reading Fluency (KS1 to KS2 Transition)
- **Key Stage 1 focus**: Learning to decode; establishing phonemic awareness and grapheme-phoneme correspondence
- **Key Stage 2 focus**: Developing fluency; automatic word recognition freeing cognitive resources for comprehension
- **Critical transition**: By Year 3, pupils should be moving from explicit phonics instruction to application in reading

### Comprehension Development
- **KS1**: Literal comprehension; answering straightforward questions about texts
- **Lower KS2**: Inferential comprehension; reading between the lines; understanding character motivation
- **Upper KS2**: Critical evaluation; understanding authorial intent; comparing texts
- **KS3**: Analysis of writer's craft; understanding literary devices; contextual interpretation
- **KS4**: Critical perspectives; alternative readings; theoretical frameworks

### Writing Development
- **KS1**: Simple sentence construction; phonetically plausible spelling; basic punctuation
- **KS2**: Paragraphing; expanded sentence structures; growing spelling accuracy; use of punctuation for effect
- **KS3**: Conscious crafting; vocabulary and sentence variety for effect; audience adaptation
- **KS4**: Sophisticated control of register; rhetorical techniques; sustained argument and analysis

### Spoken Language Development
- **KS1**: Turn-taking; listening to instructions; simple presentations
- **KS2**: Collaborative discussion; formal presentations; improvisation and performance
- **KS3**: Structured debate; persuasive argument; analytical discussion of literature
- **KS4**: Complex rhetorical strategies; adapting language for academic and professional contexts

## Common Misconceptions and Implementation Challenges

Research and inspection evidence reveal several common misconceptions in implementing the National Curriculum for English:

### Misconception 1: "Phonics is only for Key Stage 1"
While systematic phonics instruction should be prioritised in early reading, the National Curriculum recognises that some pupils continue to need explicit decoding support beyond Year 2. The Key Stage 2 programmes of study explicitly state that pupils who are still struggling to decode need to be taught to do so urgently through rigorous and systematic phonics.

### Misconception
