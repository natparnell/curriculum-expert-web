# GCSE English Specifications: AQA, Edexcel, OCR and WJEC

## Introduction

The landscape of GCSE English in England is dominated by four awarding bodies: AQA (Assessment and Qualifications Alliance), Pearson Edexcel, OCR (Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations), and WJEC Eduqas. Each board offers specifications for both English Language and English Literature that comply with the Department for Education's subject content requirements published in 2013 and amended subsequently. Whilst all specifications share common structural elements mandated by the DfE, each awarding body interprets these requirements differently, offering distinct approaches to assessment, text choices, and pedagogical emphasis. Understanding these variations is essential for curriculum leaders, teachers, and school leaders making specification decisions that will shape students' educational experiences and outcomes across Years 10 and 11.

This knowledge file provides a comprehensive analysis of all four awarding bodies' specifications, their assessment objectives, set text choices, and non-examined assessment requirements. It draws upon the official specifications, DfE subject content documentation, and Ofsted research into effective English teaching to support informed curriculum decision-making.

## AQA Specification (8700 English Language / 8702 English Literature)

### Overview

AQA is the largest awarding body for GCSE English, with the majority of students in England sitting AQA examinations. The specification is characterised by clear structure, extensive resource provision, and well-established assessment materials. AQA's dominance means that a wealth of published resources, training materials, and online support is available, though this can also lead to over-reliance on commercial materials rather than subject expertise.

### English Language (8700)

#### Structure and Assessment

AQA English Language comprises two equally weighted examination papers, each worth 50% of the final grade:

**Paper 1: Explorations in Creative Reading and Writing** (1 hour 45 minutes, 80 marks)
- Section A: Reading (40 marks) – one literature fiction text with four questions
- Section B: Writing (40 marks) – descriptive or narrative writing

**Paper 2: Writers' Viewpoints and Perspectives** (1 hour 45 minutes, 80 marks)
- Section A: Reading (40 marks) – two linked non-fiction texts with four questions
- Section B: Writing (40 marks) – writing to present a viewpoint

The reading questions across both papers follow a consistent structure: a short retrieval question (4 marks), language analysis (8 marks), structural analysis (8 marks), and an extended evaluative comparison (20 marks on Paper 2, 20 marks on Paper 1 requiring critical evaluation).

#### Assessment Objectives Coverage

AQA's Language papers distribute assessment objectives as follows:

- **AO1** (Identify and interpret information): Primarily Paper 1 Q1 and Paper 2 Q1-2
- **AO2** (Language analysis): Paper 1 Q2 and Paper 2 Q3
- **AO3** (Comparison): Paper 2 Q4 only
- **AO4** (Writing): Section B on both papers
- **AO5** (Technical accuracy): Section B on both papers

### English Literature (8702)

#### Structure and Assessment

AQA English Literature comprises two examination papers:

- Section A: Shakespeare (34 marks) – one essay question on a set text
- Section B: The 19th-Century Novel (30 marks) – one essay question on a set text

Both sections require students to write in detail about an extract from the text and then write about the text as a whole.

**Paper 2: Modern Texts and Poetry** (2 hours 15 minutes, 96 marks, 60% of GCSE)
- Section A: Modern Texts (34 marks) – one essay on a set text
- Section B: Poetry (30 marks) – comparative essay on two poems from the AQA Anthology
- Section C: Unseen Poetry (32 marks) – one question on a single unseen poem, one comparative question

## Pearson Edexcel Specification (1EN0 English Language / 1ET0 English Literature)

### Overview

Edexcel's specifications emphasise skills-based assessment and offer a slightly different approach to text coverage. The International GCSE specification is also popular in independent schools and internationally, though state schools must follow the 1EN0/1ET0 specifications for league table purposes.

### English Language (1EN0)

#### Structure and Assessment

**Paper 1: Fiction and Imaginative Writing** (1 hour 45 minutes, 64 marks, 40% of GCSE)
- Section A: Reading (24 marks) – one fiction text with three questions
- Section B: Writing (40 marks) – imaginative writing task

**Paper 2: Non-Fiction and Transactional Writing** (2 hours 5 minutes, 96 marks, 60% of GCSE)
- Section A: Reading (24 marks) – two thematically linked non-fiction extracts with three questions
- Section B: Writing (72 marks) – two transactional writing tasks

A distinctive feature of Edexcel's Paper 2 is the requirement for students to complete two transactional writing tasks rather than one extended piece. This assesses a broader range of non-fiction writing forms but means less depth for any single piece.

#### Assessment Approach

Edexcel uses a skills-based mark scheme that explicitly rewards specific reading and writing competencies. The specification emphasises the ability to synthesise information across texts and produce writing for different purposes and audiences.

## Assessment Objectives: Cross-Board Comparison

All four awarding bodies assess the same Department for Education assessment objectives, though weightings and distribution vary:

### English Language Assessment Objectives

| AO | Description | Typical Weighting |
|----|-------------|-------------------|
| **AO1** | Identify and interpret explicit and implicit information and ideas; select and synthesise evidence from different texts | 15-20% |
| **AO2** | Explain, comment on and analyse how writers use language and structure to achieve effects and influence readers | 25-30% |
| **AO3** | Compare writers' ideas and perspectives, as well as how these are conveyed, across two or more texts | 10-15% |
| **AO4** | Evaluate texts critically and support this with appropriate textual references | 10-15% |
| **AO5** | Communicate clearly, effectively and imaginatively; select and adapt tone, style and register for different forms, purposes and audiences | 15-20% |
| **AO6** | Use a range of vocabulary and sentence structures with accurate spelling and punctuation | 10-15% |

### English Literature Assessment Objectives

| AO | Description | Typical Weighting |
|----|-------------|-------------------|
| **AO1** | Read, understand and respond to texts; maintain a critical style; develop an informed personal response; use textual references | 25-30% |
| **AO2** | Analyse the language, form and structure used by a writer to create meanings and effects | 30-40% |
| **AO3** | Show understanding of the relationships between texts and the contexts in which they were written | 20-25% |
| **AO4** | Use a range of vocabulary and sentence structures with accurate spelling and punctuation | 5-10% |

Key differences between boards emerge in how these objectives are assessed:

- **AQA** places heavy emphasis on **AO2** (language analysis) in both Language and Literature, with Language Paper 1 Q2 and Paper 2 Q3 specifically targeting this objective
- **Edexcel** distributes **AO3** (context) more evenly across their Literature papers than AQA, which concentrates context assessment in the 19th-century novel question
- **OCR** offers more explicit **AO1** assessment through their reading comprehension questions, which often reward literal understanding alongside inference
- **Eduqas** provides the most extensive **AO2** opportunities through their separate Unseen Poetry paper

---

## Non-Examined Assessment: Spoken Language Endorsement

All four awarding bodies include a non-examined assessment component for GCSE English Language: the Spoken Language Endorsement. This is a separate endorsement (Pass/Merit/Distinction) that does not contribute to the final 9-1 grade but appears on the certificate.

### Requirements (Common Across All Boards)

The DfE requires that the spoken language endorsement assesses students' ability to:

- Demonstrate presentation skills in a formal setting
- Use spoken Standard English effectively
- Listen and respond appropriately to questions and feedback

The assessment typically involves:
- A prepared presentation (3-5 minutes) on a topic of the student's choice
- Question and answer session following the presentation
- Assessment by the teacher against common criteria

### Key Features

**AQA:** Students prepare and deliver a spoken presentation on a chosen topic. They may use notes, PowerPoint, or other visual aids. The presentation is assessed by the teacher and recorded. Grades are submitted as Distinction, Merit, Pass, or Not Classified.

**Edexcel:** Similar structure to AQA, with emphasis on formal register and ability to respond to questions. Edexcel provides detailed guidance on managing the administrative requirements of the endorsement.

**OCR:** OCR's approach emphasises the development of oracy skills throughout the course, with the endorsement representing a culmination of ongoing speaking and listening activities.

**WJEC Eduqas:** Eduqas places particular emphasis on the quality of response to audience questions, assessing adaptability and responsiveness alongside prepared content.

### Administrative Considerations

- The endorsement must be completed and submitted by early May (typically 7 May for AQA)
- Recordings must be kept for moderation purposes
- Students may opt not to complete the endorsement, in which case the certificate records "Not Classified"
- The endorsement does not affect the overall GCSE grade but is required for the EBacc and may be considered by employers and higher education institutions

## Set Text Selection: Strategic Considerations

Choosing appropriate set texts is one of the most significant curriculum decisions English departments make. Each awarding body offers different advantages:

### Shakespeare

**Most popular choices across all boards:** *Romeo and Juliet* and *Macbeth* dominate entries due to their clear plot structures, engaging themes, and extensive resource availability. *The Tempest* is increasingly popular for its post-colonial resonances and thematic relevance.

**Distinctive offerings:**
- AQA offers *Julius Caesar* (unique to AQA)
- Edexcel offers *Twelfth Night* (unique to Edexcel)
- Eduqas offers *Othello* (unique to Eduqas)

### 19th-Century Novel

**Most popular choices:** *A Christmas Carol* and *Jekyll and Hyde* remain the most frequently taught due to their brevity, accessible themes, and strong film adaptations.

**Distinctive offerings:**
- Edexcel offers *The Sign of Four* (unique)
- OCR offers *The War of the Worlds* and *The Picture of Dorian Gray* (unique)
- Eduqas offers *Silas Marner* (unique)

### Modern Texts

**Most popular choices:** *An Inspector Calls* dominates entries due to its compact structure, clear social messaging, and examination success rate. *Animal Farm* and *Lord of the Flies* are also widely taught.

**Distinctive offerings:**
- AQA offers *Telling Tales* (short story anthology, unique)
- AQA offers *Anita and Me* and *Pigeon English* (diverse voices)
- Eduqas offers *Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit* and *The Hunger Games* (contemporary choices)

### Poetry

**Cluster sizes vary significantly:**
- AQA and OCR: 15 poems per cluster
- Edexcel: 15 poems per cluster
- Eduqas: 35 poems per cluster (considerably larger, requiring more preparation)

**Thematic approaches:**
- All boards offer "Relationships" and "Conflict" themes
- Edexcel uniquely offers "Time and Place" (popular for nature and environment connections)

---

## Pedagogical Implications of Specification Choice

### AQA: The "Standard" Approach

**Advantages:**
- Extensive resource availability (published materials, online support, training)
- Clear, predictable question structures
- Large candidature means mark schemes are well-calibrated
- Strong support for EAL learners through predictable question formats

**Challenges:**
- Over-reliance on commercial resources can undermine subject expertise
- High-stakes unseen poetry assessment (Section C of Paper 2)
- Context assessment concentrated in the 19th-century novel can lead to narrow teaching

**Best for:** Departments seeking security, extensive resource support, and predictable assessment structures.

### Edexcel: The Skills-Based Approach

**Advantages:**
- Explicit focus on transferable skills
- Two transactional writing tasks provide breadth of writing experience
- "Time and Place" poetry cluster offers nature/environment connections
- Strong support for progression to Edexcel A Level

**Challenges:**
- Less resource availability compared to AQA
- Two transactional writing tasks in Paper 2 can be demanding for lower-attaining students
- Smaller candidature means fewer exemplar materials

**Best for:** Departments prioritising skills over content and seeking distinctive curriculum approaches.

### OCR: The Flexible Approach

**Advantages:**
- Open text option for Literature (though rarely used)
- Balanced assessment of reading and writing across Language papers
- Cambridge Assessment heritage provides academic credibility
- Distinctive text choices (Dorian Gray, War of the Worlds)

**Challenges:**
- Limited resource availability
- Smallest candidature of the four boards
- Some centres report administrative challenges

**Best for:** Confident departments seeking flexibility and distinctive text choices.

### WJEC Eduqas: The Integrated Approach

**Advantages:**
- Integrated Language/Literature approach in Component 1 Language
- Separate Unseen Poetry paper allows dedicated teaching time
- Large poetry clusters (35 poems) enable comprehensive poetry study
- Distinctive contemporary text choices (Hunger Games)

**Challenges:**
- Large poetry clusters require significant teaching time
- Smaller resource base than AQA
- Three Literature papers (rather than two) may increase examination burden

**Best for:** Departments valuing integrated approaches and extensive poetry study.

---

## Comparing Assessment Demands

### Reading Assessment

All boards require analysis of unseen texts, but approaches differ:

**AQA:** Emphasises language analysis (AO2) through dedicated questions worth 8 marks each. The comparison question (Paper 2 Q4) requires evaluation across two texts.

**Edexcel:** Uses fewer, longer questions that reward sustained analysis. The skills-based approach rewards explicit identification of techniques.

**OCR:** Offers more questions targeting literal comprehension alongside inference, supporting students who struggle with implicit meaning.

**Eduqas:** Requires study of 20th-century literary prose for Language Component 1, integrating literary study into Language assessment.

### Writing Assessment

**AQA:** One extended creative/descriptive piece (Paper 1) and one argumentative piece (Paper 2). This allows depth but limited breadth.

**Edexcel:** One creative piece (Paper 1) and two transactional pieces (Paper 2). This provides breadth but limits depth.

**OCR:** Two writing tasks per paper, mixing creative and transactional across both papers. This provides balance but requires versatility.

**Eduqas:** One creative piece (Component 1) and two transactional pieces (Component 2). Similar to Edexcel but with integrated literary reading.

### Literature Assessment

All boards use closed-book assessment (with limited open-book options at OCR), requiring students to memorise quotations and textual details.

**Extract-based questions:** All boards use extracts as starting points for essay responses, but weightings vary:
- AQA: Extract analysis typically worth 1/3 of essay marks
- Edexcel: Similar approach to AQA
- OCR: Similar approach
- Eduqas: Extract analysis may be weighted differently depending on component

---

## Transition Considerations

### From KS3 to GCSE

Specification choice should consider KS3 curriculum foundations:

- **AQA** aligns well with traditional KS3 curricula focusing on canonical texts
- **Edexcel** suits skills-based KS3 approaches
- **OCR** accommodates flexible, thematic KS3 curricula
- **Eduqas** supports integrated Language/Literature KS3 models

### From GCSE to A Level

While GCSE specification does not determine A Level options, some alignment exists:

- **AQA GCSE** provides strong foundation for **AQA A Level Literature** and **AQA A Level Language**
- **Edexcel GCSE** aligns with **Edexcel A Level** specifications
- **OCR GCSE** supports progression to **OCR A Level** and **Cambridge Pre-U**
- **Eduqas GCSE** prepares students for **Eduqas A Level**

---

## Making the Decision: Key Questions for Departments

When selecting a specification, departments should consider:

1. **Resource availability:** Does the department have existing resources for particular texts?

2. **Staff expertise:** Do teachers have experience teaching specific texts or approaches?

3. **Student profile:** Does the specification suit the prior attainment and needs of the cohort?

4. **Progression:** Does the specification prepare students appropriately for post-16 study?

5. **Department culture:** Does the specification align with departmental values and teaching approaches?

6. **Assessment confidence:** Does the question structure suit departmental strengths?

7. **Text diversity:** Does the specification offer appropriate representation and challenge?

---

## Conclusion

The choice of GCSE English specification is a significant curriculum decision that shapes students' experiences across two years of study. While all four awarding bodies offer rigorous, valid assessments that comply with DfE requirements, their distinct approaches to text selection, assessment structure, and pedagogical emphasis provide genuine alternatives.

AQA's dominance reflects its extensive resources and predictable structures, but Edexcel, OCR, and WJEC Eduqas offer valuable alternatives for departments seeking distinctive approaches. The key is aligning specification choice with departmental expertise, student needs, and curriculum values.

The shared assessment objectives ensure that high-quality English teaching—focused on deep textual engagement, analytical precision, and effective communication—will serve students well regardless of specification choice. Ultimately, the quality of teaching matters more than the awarding body selected.
