# KS1 and KS2 Assessment in English

## Overview of Primary English Assessment

Assessment of English in primary schools in England operates through a combination of statutory national curriculum tests (commonly known as SATs), statutory teacher assessments, and the phonics screening check. The Standards and Testing Agency (STA), an executive agency of the Department for Education (DfE), oversees all statutory assessment and moderation processes. Understanding the structure, purpose, and pedagogical implications of these assessments is essential for primary practitioners, curriculum leaders, and senior leaders responsible for assessment data.

The assessment landscape has undergone significant changes in recent years. Most notably, Key Stage 1 SATs became non-statutory from September 2023, rendering them optional for schools from the 2023-24 academic year onwards. This change was precipitated by the introduction of the statutory Reception Baseline Assessment (RBA) in September 2021, which provides the baseline for measuring progress between reception and Key Stage 2, thereby making the Key Stage 1 to Key Stage 2 progress measure redundant.

## The Phonics Screening Check

### Purpose and Statutory Requirements

The phonics screening check is a statutory assessment for all pupils in Year 1, typically administered in June when pupils are aged 6. Its purpose is to confirm whether pupils have met the expected standard in phonic decoding. Pupils who do not achieve the expected standard in Year 1 must receive targeted support from their school and retake the check in Year 2.

The DfE publishes annual guidance on administering the check, including the Assessment and Reporting Arrangements (ARA) and detailed administration guidance. Schools must adhere to strict protocols to ensure valid and reliable results, including maintaining test security and following prescribed administration procedures.

### Structure and Content

The phonics screening check comprises a short, light-touch assessment designed to measure pupils' ability to decode words using their phonic knowledge. The check contains 40 words divided into two sections:

- **Section 1**: Words that follow simple grapheme-phoneme correspondences
- **Section 2**: Words that follow more complex grapheme-phoneme correspondences, including those with digraphs, trigraphs, and alternative pronunciations

The 40 words include a mixture of real words and pseudo-words (alien words). Pseudo-words are included to assess whether pupils can decode unfamiliar words using phonic knowledge alone, without relying on sight recognition or context clues. Each pseudo-word is accompanied by a picture of an imaginary creature to provide context and help pupils understand that these are made-up words.

### Threshold and Reporting

The expected standard threshold varies slightly each year but is typically set at 32 out of 40 correct answers. The Standards and Testing Agency announces the threshold mark after all schools have administered the check, ensuring the threshold remains stable year-on-year.

Headteachers must report results to parents, indicating whether their child has met the expected standard. For pupils who do not meet the expected standard, schools should outline the support that will be put in place to help the pupil progress. Results must be submitted to the DfE, contributing to national statistics on phonics attainment.

### Pedagogical Implications

The DfE's Reading Framework (2023) emphasises that systematic synthetic phonics (SSP) should be the prime approach to teaching early reading. The framework stresses the importance of "fidelity to the programme"—implementing a validated SSP programme with consistency and without introducing conflicting approaches that might confuse pupils.

Effective phonics teaching, as outlined in the Reading Framework, includes:

- **Daily discrete phonics sessions**: Typically 20-30 minutes, following a structured programme
- **Decodable reading practice**: Pupils should read books that match their current phonic knowledge, containing only grapheme-phoneme correspondences they have been taught
- **Rapid intervention**: Pupils falling behind should receive immediate, targeted support to prevent them from falling further behind their peers
- **Application across the curriculum**: Opportunities to apply phonic knowledge in reading and writing throughout the school day

Schools should avoid using the phonics screening check as the sole measure of reading ability. While it effectively assesses decoding skills, it does not assess comprehension, fluency, or reading for pleasure—equally important aspects of reading development.

## Key Stage 1 Assessment (Optional from 2024)

### Changes to Statutory Status

From the 2023-24 academic year, Key Stage 1 national curriculum tests (SATs) in English reading and mathematics became non-statutory. This means schools may choose whether to administer the tests, though many continue to use them as part of their assessment repertoire. The phonics screening check in Year 1 and Year 2 (for those retaking) remains statutory.

The removal of statutory Key Stage 1 SATs reflects the government's shift toward the Reception Baseline Assessment as the starting point for measuring primary school accountability. With progress now measured from reception to Year 6, the Key Stage 1 assessments no longer serve their original purpose in the accountability framework.

### Optional Teacher Assessment Frameworks

The Standards and Testing Agency continues to publish optional teacher assessment frameworks (TAFs) for Key Stage 1 in English reading, English writing, mathematics, and science. These frameworks support teachers in making statutory teacher assessment judgements for pupils who have completed the Key Stage 1 programmes of study and are working at the standard of national curriculum assessments.

The TAFs set out the standards against which teachers must make their judgements. For each subject, there are three attainment categories:

- **Working towards the expected standard**: Pupils have not yet achieved all the expected standards but are making progress
- **Working at the expected standard**: Pupils have achieved all the expected standards for their key stage
- **Working at greater depth within the expected standard**: Pupils have demonstrated a deeper understanding and can apply their knowledge more broadly and in more complex contexts

### English Reading Assessment at Key Stage 1

The optional teacher assessment framework for English reading requires teachers to assess pupils against specific statements that describe the knowledge, skills, and understanding expected at the expected standard and at greater depth.

For the **expected standard**, pupils must demonstrate that they can:

- Read accurately words of two or more syllables using knowledge of blending GPCs
- Read words containing common suffixes
- Read aloud books closely matched to their improving phonic knowledge
- Answer questions and make inferences on the basis of what is being said and done

For **greater depth**, pupils must demonstrate additional capabilities, including:

- Reading fluently and with confidence
- Demonstrating a deeper understanding of texts through inference and explanation
- Making connections between different parts of texts
- Understanding nuance and implied meaning

### Writing Assessment at Key Stage 1

Writing at Key Stage 1 is assessed through teacher assessment only—there is no test. Teachers must use the interim teacher assessment frameworks to make their judgements, which are based on independent work pupils have produced across the curriculum.

The TAF for writing requires pupils working at the expected standard to demonstrate they can:

- Write simple, coherent narratives about personal experiences and those of others
- Write about real events, recording these simply and clearly
- Demarcate most sentences with capital letters and full stops
- Use co-ordination (and, or, but) and some subordination (when, if, that, because)
- Spell many common exception words
- Form lower-case letters correctly, with some joins

Greater depth writing demonstrates more sophisticated use of vocabulary, sentence structure, and punctuation, with pupils able to write effectively and coherently for different purposes.

## Key Stage 2 SATs: English Reading

### Structure and Format

At the end of Key Stage 2 (Year 6), pupils sit statutory national curriculum tests in English reading, English grammar, punctuation and spelling (GPS), and mathematics. The English reading test consists of a single paper with three texts and accompanying questions, administered over one hour.

The reading paper is designed to assess pupils' ability to:

- Retrieve information from texts
- Make inferences and justify them with evidence from the text
- Summarise main ideas from more than one paragraph
- Predict what might happen from details stated and implied
- Identify how language, structure, and presentation contribute to meaning
- Make comparisons within and across texts

### Content Domains

The questions in the reading test are mapped to specific content domains derived from the national curriculum programme of study. These content domains ensure comprehensive coverage of reading skills:

**2a**: Give or explain the meaning of words in context
**2b**: Retrieve and record information or identify key details from fiction and non-fiction
**2c**: Summarise main ideas from more than one paragraph
**2d**: Make inferences from the text or explain and justify inferences with evidence from the text
**2e**: Predict what might happen from details stated and implied
**2f**: Identify or explain how information or narrative content is related and contributes to meaning as a whole
**2g**: Identify or explain how meaning is enhanced through choice of words and phrases
**2h**: Make comparisons within the text

Analysis of recent SATs papers reveals that retrieval and inference questions consistently dominate the test. In the 2025 paper, for example, retrieval questions accounted for approximately 30% of the paper, while inference questions reached their highest proportion ever, comprising nearly half the questions.

### Text Types and Complexity

The reading paper includes a range of text types designed to assess different reading skills. These typically include:

- **Fiction extracts**: Usually from contemporary or classic children's literature
- **Non-fiction texts**: May include biographies, diary entries, newspaper articles, or information texts
- **Poetry**: Often a complete poem or substantial extract

Texts are carefully selected to provide appropriate challenge for Year 6 pupils, with reading ages and text complexity calibrated to the expected standard. The three texts are ordered by difficulty, with the first text typically being the most accessible and the final text offering the greatest challenge.

### Scoring and Expected Standards

The raw score from the reading test is converted to a scaled score, where 100 represents the expected standard. Pupils scoring below 100 have not met the expected standard, while those scoring above 100 have exceeded it. The threshold for "higher standard" or "greater depth" is typically set at a scaled score of 110.

National data shows that approximately 70-75% of pupils typically meet the expected standard in reading at Key Stage 2, though this varies year by year depending on test difficulty and cohort characteristics.

## Key Stage 2 SATs: Grammar, Punctuation and Spelling (GPS)

### Paper 1: Spelling

The GPS assessment comprises two papers. Paper 1 is the spelling test, which lasts approximately 15-20 minutes. It consists of 20 sentences read aloud by the test administrator, each with a missing word that pupils must spell correctly.

The 20 target words are drawn from the national curriculum word lists and patterns, including:

- Common exception words (e.g., accommodate, embarrass, privilege)
- Words with prefixes and suffixes
- Words following specific spelling rules and patterns taught across Key Stage 2
- Homophones and near-homophones

Each correct spelling is worth one mark, giving a maximum of 20 marks for the spelling paper.

### Paper 2: Grammar and Punctuation

Paper 2 is a written test lasting 45 minutes, comprising approximately 45-50 questions testing grammar and punctuation knowledge. Questions are presented in various formats, including:

- **Multiple choice**: Selecting the correct option from several choices
- **Short answer**: Writing a word, phrase, or short sentence
- **Sentence construction**: Completing or rewriting sentences to demonstrate specific grammatical knowledge

The content domains assessed in Paper 2 cover the full range of grammar and punctuation specified in the Key Stage 2 national curriculum:

**Grammatical terms and word classes**: Nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, determiners
**Functions of sentences**: Statements, questions, commands, exclamations
**Combining words, phrases and clauses**: Coordination, subordination, expanded noun phrases, fronted adverbials
**Verb forms, tenses and consistency**: Simple past and present, progressive and perfect forms, active and passive voice, subjunctive mood
**Punctuation**: Full stops, question marks, exclamation marks, commas in lists, apostrophes for contraction and possession, inverted commas, brackets, dashes, colons, semi-colons, bullet points
**Vocabulary**: Synonyms, antonyms, word meaning in context, formal and informal register
**Standard English and formality**: Recognising and using standard English, distinguishing between formal and informal language

### Scoring and Expected Standards

The GPS papers are combined to give a total raw score out of approximately 70 marks (20 spelling + 50 grammar/punctuation), which is then converted to a scaled score. As with reading, 100 represents the expected standard, with 110 typically indicating greater depth.

National attainment in GPS is typically higher than in reading and writing, with approximately 75-80% of pupils meeting the expected standard. This reflects the more discrete, knowledge-based nature of grammar and punctuation compared to the more complex skills of reading comprehension and writing composition.

## Key Stage 2 Writing: Teacher Assessment

### Statutory Requirements

Unlike reading and GPS, writing at Key Stage 2 is assessed through teacher assessment rather than a test. Teachers must submit teacher assessment judgements for writing (and science) to the DfE, based on pupils' independent work produced over time.

The teacher assessment framework for writing at Key Stage 2 sets out the standards pupils must meet to be assessed as working towards the expected standard, working at the expected standard, or working at greater depth within the expected standard.

### The Teacher Assessment Framework (TAF)

The TAF for Key Stage 2 writing requires pupils working at the expected standard to demonstrate they can:

- Write for a range of purposes and audiences, selecting appropriate form and register
- Use paragraphs to organise ideas
- Use a range of cohesive devices (conjunctions, adverbs, pronouns) to link ideas within and across paragraphs
- Use capital letters, full stops, question marks, commas for lists, commas after fronted adverbials, and apostrophes for possession and contraction with reasonable accuracy
- Use the range of punctuation taught at Key Stage 2 (brackets, dashes, colons, semi-colons) with some accuracy
- Spell most words from the Year 5/6 word list and words following the patterns taught at Key Stage 2
- Maintain legible handwriting, choosing whether to join letters

For greater depth, pupils must demonstrate they can:

- Write effectively for a range of purposes and audiences, selecting language and register to suit the context
- Use a wide range of cohesive devices appropriately
- Manage shifts in level of formality and use passive voice and subjunctive mood appropriately
- Use the full range of punctuation taught at Key Stage 2 accurately
- Spell correctly throughout their writing, including complex and unusual words
- Maintain consistently legible, joined handwriting

### Moderation Requirements

Local authorities are responsible for external moderation of Key Stage 2 writing teacher assessments in their maintained schools. Academies receive direct funding from DfE for this statutory external moderation. The moderation process involves:

- **Sample selection**: Schools submit a sample of pupils' writing to demonstrate the accuracy of their teacher assessments
- **Moderator scrutiny**: Trained moderators scrutinise the evidence and validate judgements against the TAF
- **Validation or adjustment**: Moderators either validate the school's judgements or require adjustments if evidence does not support the submitted assessment
- **Appeals process**: Schools may appeal moderation decisions if they disagree with the moderator's judgements

Effective moderation is essential for ensuring consistency and accuracy in teacher assessment across schools. Schools should engage with moderation throughout the year, not just at the submission point, using local authority training and cluster moderation sessions to develop shared understanding of standards.

### Best Practice in Writing Assessment

Effective writing assessment at Key Stage 2 requires:

- **Evidence collected across the curriculum**: Writing from English lessons, cross-curricular work, and independent tasks should all contribute to the teacher assessment
- **Independence**: Evidence must demonstrate what pupils can do independently, without scaffolding or over-reliance on models
- **Range and breadth**: Evidence should cover a range of genres and purposes, demonstrating pupils' versatility as writers
- **Sustained writing**: Pieces should be of sufficient length to demonstrate the full range of writing skills
- **Clear assessment criteria**: Teachers must understand the TAF and be able to apply it consistently

## Assessment for Learning and Formative Practice

### Beyond Statutory Assessment

While statutory assessments provide summative data for accountability purposes, effective primary English teaching relies on ongoing formative assessment. Teachers should use a range of assessment strategies to identify pupils' strengths and areas for development, adapting teaching accordingly.

Effective formative assessment in English includes:

- **Running records and reading conferences**: Regular one-to-one reading assessments to monitor progress and identify specific teaching points
- **Writing moderation within school**: Regular cross-year group and whole-school moderation to develop shared standards
- **Pupil self-assessment**: Helping pupils understand what they are learning and how to improve
- **Question-level analysis**: Using statutory assessment data to identify patterns of strength and weakness to inform teaching

### Using Assessment Data

School leaders and English subject leaders should use assessment data thoughtfully, recognising its limitations. Test scores provide only a snapshot of performance and should be triangulated with teacher assessment and ongoing classroom evidence.

Effective use of assessment data includes:

- **Identifying trends**: Looking at cohort patterns over time to evaluate curriculum and teaching effectiveness
- **Targeting intervention**: Using question-level analysis to identify specific areas where pupils need additional support
- **Evaluating provision**: Assessing whether particular groups (disadvantaged pupils, pupils with SEND, EAL learners) are making appropriate progress
- **Informing curriculum planning**: Using assessment findings to identify gaps in the curriculum or areas where teaching needs strengthening

## Common Challenges and Misconceptions

### Teaching to the Test

A persistent challenge in primary English is the pressure to "teach to the test," narrowing the curriculum to focus narrowly on tested content. This can lead to:

- Over-emphasis on test technique at
