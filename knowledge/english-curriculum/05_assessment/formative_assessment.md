# Formative Assessment in English

## Introduction

Formative assessment, often referred to as **Assessment for Learning (AfL)**, represents one of the most significant pedagogical developments in English teaching over the past two decades. The landmark work of **Dylan Wiliam** and **Paul Black** (Inside the Black Box, 1998) established that formative assessment, when implemented effectively, can yield learning gains equivalent to an additional one to two years of schooling. In English, where progression is often less linear than in subjects with more concrete right/wrong answers, formative assessment assumes particular importance in guiding pupils' development as readers, writers, and critical thinkers.

This knowledge file examines formative assessment strategies specifically tailored to English teaching across Key Stages 1-5, drawing on research from the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), Ofsted inspection frameworks, and professional bodies including the National Association for the Teaching of English (NATE) and the United Kingdom Literacy Association (UKLA).

## Part 1: The Theoretical Foundation of Assessment for Learning

### 1.1 Defining Formative Assessment

Formative assessment is defined by **Black and Wiliam (1998)** as "all those activities undertaken by teachers, and by their students in assessing themselves, which provide information to be used as feedback to modify the teaching and learning activities in which they are engaged." This definition highlights two critical features:

- **Feedback loops**: Information gathered must actually inform subsequent teaching and learning
- **Student agency**: Pupils must be actively involved in assessing their own learning

The **EEF's Teaching and Learning Toolkit** (2024) identifies feedback as having a high impact on pupil progress, with an average effect size of 0.78—equivalent to approximately six months' additional progress. However, the Toolkit also notes significant variation in impact, with the quality and nature of feedback being decisive factors.

### 1.2 The Five Key Strategies

**Dylan Wiliam (2011)** identifies five core strategies that constitute effective formative assessment:

1. **Clarifying, sharing, and understanding learning intentions and success criteria**
2. **Engineering effective classroom discussions, tasks, and activities that elicit evidence of learning**
3. **Providing feedback that moves learners forward**
4. **Activating students as learning resources for one another** (peer assessment)
5. **Activating students as owners of their own learning** (self-assessment)

In English, these strategies require careful adaptation. Learning intentions in writing, for instance, must balance procedural objectives ("to use fronted adverbials") with the developmental nature of writing craft. Similarly, success criteria for reading comprehension must avoid reducing literary response to checklists while still providing clarity about quality.

### 1.3 The Role of Summative Assessment

While this file focuses on formative assessment, it is important to distinguish it from summative assessment without positioning them as opposites. **Ofsted's Research Review Series: English** (2022) notes that "the most effective schools use assessment to support learning rather than to label pupils or to generate data for external audiences." Summative assessments can serve formative purposes when used diagnostically—for example, when a reading comprehension test reveals specific inference weaknesses that inform subsequent teaching.

## Part 2: Clarifying Learning Intentions and Success Criteria

### 2.1 Learning Intentions in English

Effective learning intentions in English communicate what pupils will learn, not merely what they will do. The distinction is crucial: "We are learning to write persuasively" differs meaningfully from "We are writing a persuasive letter." The former focuses on transferable understanding; the latter on task completion.

**Key principles for learning intentions in English:**

- **Focus on conceptual understanding**: "We are learning how writers create suspense" rather than "We are writing a suspense story"
- **Make disciplinary thinking explicit**: "We are learning to analyse how language choices affect meaning" rather than "We are looking at this poem"
- **Connect to prior learning**: Reference previous lessons explicitly to build coherent progression

### 2.2 Success Criteria in Writing

Success criteria provide pupils with a clear understanding of what quality looks like. In English, they serve multiple functions:

**Process criteria** describe the stages of production:
- Plan your narrative using a story mountain
- Include at least three descriptive techniques
- Proofread for capital letters and full stops

**Product criteria** describe features of the finished work:
- Varied sentence openers create rhythm and pace
- Precise vocabulary choices convey character emotions
- Dialogue advances the plot and reveals character

**WAGOLLs (What A Good One Looks Like)** provide concrete exemplars. The **EEF's Improving Literacy in Key Stage 2** guidance recommends using anonymous exemplars to help pupils internalise quality standards. These should be:
- **Developmentally appropriate**: Slightly above most pupils' current attainment
- **Annotated**: With commentary explaining why particular choices are effective
- **Discussed**: Through guided analysis rather than passive presentation

### 2.3 Co-Constructing Success Criteria

Research by **Clarke (2014)** demonstrates that success criteria developed collaboratively with pupils are more effective than those simply presented. In English, co-construction might involve:

1. **Examining exemplars**: Present two versions of a text—one effective, one less so—and ask pupils to identify differences
2. **Reverse-engineering from quality**: Analyse an effective piece to identify what makes it successful
3. **Building shared vocabulary**: Develop a common language for discussing quality (e.g., "show, don't tell" in descriptive writing)

This process develops pupils' **metalanguage**—the ability to talk about language and literature using technical terminology—which the **National Curriculum for English** identifies as important for analytical work.

---

## Part 3: Eliciting Evidence of Learning

### 3.1 Diagnostic Questioning

Questioning is perhaps the most frequently used yet often least effective formative assessment tool. **Dylan Wiliam (2018)** distinguishes between **hinge questions**—used at critical points to determine whether to move on or reteach—and **diagnostic questions**—designed to reveal underlying misconceptions.

**Effective questioning in English:**

- **Avoid self-answering**: Pause sufficiently after questions (3-5 seconds) to allow thinking
- **Use "no hands up"**: Deploy techniques like lollipop sticks or cold calling to ensure universal accountability
- **Plan questions in advance**: Particularly for higher-order questions about authorial intention or textual interpretation

**Hinge questions in reading comprehension** might include:
- "Which word tells us the character is frightened?" (retrieval)
- "Why might the author have chosen to describe the setting at this point?" (inference)
- "How does this paragraph build tension?" (analysis)

### 3.2 Think-Pair-Share

This classic strategy provides multiple opportunities for formative assessment:

1. **Think**: Individual processing time allows all pupils to engage with the question
2. **Pair**: Discussion with a partner surfaces partial understandings and generates language for explanation
3. **Share**: Whole-class sharing allows the teacher to sample understanding across the class

In English, Think-Pair-Share proves particularly valuable for interpretive questions where multiple valid readings exist. The strategy validates diverse responses while allowing the teacher to identify common misconceptions.

### 3.3 Exit Tickets and Mini Whiteboards

**Exit tickets**—brief written responses collected at lesson end—provide snapshot evidence of learning. Effective exit tickets in English might ask pupils to:
- Identify the most important word in a poem and justify their choice
- Write one sentence using the grammar focus from the lesson
- Summarise the main argument of a persuasive text in 20 words

**Mini whiteboards** offer immediate, visible evidence of whole-class understanding. They prove particularly useful for:
- Spelling and grammar diagnostics
- Identifying literary devices in displayed text
- Voting on interpretive questions

The key to using these tools formatively lies in responding to the evidence they reveal. If exit tickets show half the class misunderstood the learning intention, the next lesson must address this explicitly.

### 3.4 Live Writing and Modelling

**Live modelling**—writing in real-time while thinking aloud—provides rich opportunities for formative assessment. As teachers model, they can:
- Pause to evaluate choices ("I'm not sure about this word—does it capture the mood?")
- Invite pupil suggestions at decision points
- Make revisions visible, normalising the drafting process

**Shared writing** extends this by involving pupils directly in composition. The teacher acts as scribe while pupils contribute ideas and evaluate options. This provides immediate insight into pupils' understanding of writing craft while scaffolding their development.

## Part 4: Feedback That Moves Learners Forward

### 4.1 The Nature of Effective Feedback

**Hattie and Timperley (2007)** propose that effective feedback addresses three questions:
1. Where am I going? (learning intentions)
2. How am I going? (current performance)
3. Where to next? (next steps)

In English, feedback must also address the **affective dimension** of the subject. Writing involves personal investment; criticism of writing can feel like criticism of self. Effective feedback in English therefore balances **accuracy-oriented feedback** (technical corrections) with **growth-oriented feedback** (developmental guidance).

### 4.2 Written Feedback on Writing

The **EEF's Teacher Feedback to Improve Pupil Learning** report (2021) synthesises extensive research on written feedback. Key findings for English include:

**Frequency vs. quality**: More feedback is not necessarily better. Focused feedback on specific aspects of writing proves more effective than comprehensive marking of every error.

**The spacing effect**: Delayed feedback (returning work the following lesson) can be more effective than immediate feedback for complex writing tasks, allowing pupils to gain emotional distance from their work.

**Actionable specificity**: Comments like "Use more interesting vocabulary" are less effective than "Try replacing three 'said's with precise verbs that show how the character is speaking."

### 4.3 Whole-Class Feedback

**Whole-class feedback** has gained significant traction in English departments as a workload-efficient alternative to individual marking. The approach typically involves:

1. **Reviewing all work** to identify common strengths and areas for development
2. **Creating a feedback document** listing these patterns with exemplars
3. **Teaching a feedback lesson** addressing the most significant issues
4. **Providing individual next steps** for pupils with specific needs

**Advantages of whole-class feedback:**
- Reduces teacher workload while maintaining quality
- Addresses misconceptions common to multiple pupils
- Allows teaching of new content in response to identified gaps
- Ensures all pupils benefit from feedback, not just those who received written comments

**Limitations and mitigations:**
- Less personalised than individual feedback; supplement with brief individual notes
- Risk of pupils feeling their specific work wasn't considered; address this by referencing specific examples from pupils' work (anonymously)
- Requires careful planning to ensure the lesson addresses genuine needs

### 4.4 Verbal Feedback

Verbal feedback offers immediacy and interactivity that written feedback cannot match. **The Education Endowment Foundation (2021)** notes that verbal feedback is particularly effective when it occurs during the writing process rather than after completion.

**Effective verbal feedback strategies:**

- **Conferencing**: Brief 1:1 conversations during writing time (2-3 minutes per pupil)
- **Strategy naming**: Explicitly name the strategy you're suggesting ("You're using 'show, don't tell' effectively here")
- **Questioning**: Use questions to prompt thinking rather than directives ("What do you want the reader to feel here?")

### 4.5 Marking Policies and Workload

The **Ofsted School Inspection Handbook** (2024) explicitly states that inspectors will not expect to see any specific frequency, type, or volume of marking. Instead, inspectors evaluate whether assessment is used effectively to support learning.

The **Department for Education's (DfE) Marking Policy Review Group** (2016) identified principles for manageable marking:

- **Meaningful**: Marking should provide useful information to pupils and teachers
- **Manageable**: Policies should be sustainable given teachers' workload
- **Motivating**: Feedback should encourage further effort

Many English departments have moved away from "deep marking" (extensive written comments on every piece) toward more sustainable approaches including:
- **Code marking**: Using symbols/shorthand for common issues
- **Self-assessment checklists**: Pupils identify their own errors before submission
- **Peer review protocols**: Structured peer feedback using success criteria

---

## Part 5: Peer and Self-Assessment

### 5.1 The Rationale for Peer Assessment

Peer assessment serves multiple purposes beyond merely reducing teacher workload. **Topping (2009)** identifies benefits including:

- **Enhanced understanding**: Assessing others' work deepens understanding of quality criteria
- **Metacognitive development**: Evaluating work against criteria develops metacognitive awareness
- **Social learning**: Peer interaction supports collaborative knowledge construction

However, peer assessment also presents challenges. Pupils may be reluctant to critique friends, may lack assessment expertise, or may provide superficial feedback. Effective peer assessment in English requires careful scaffolding.

### 5.2 Scaffolding Peer Assessment

**Structured protocols** prove essential for effective peer assessment. The **EEF's Metacognition and Self-Regulated Learning** guidance (2018) recommends:

1. **Clear success criteria**: Pupils must understand what quality looks like before assessing
2. **Focused assessment**: Limit peer assessment to specific aspects (e.g., "Comment on the opening hook and one piece of evidence")
3. **Sentence starters**: Provide language frames for constructive feedback ("One strength is... One area to develop is...")
4. **Training**: Explicitly teach peer assessment skills before expecting independent use

### 5.3 Self-Assessment and Metacognition

Self-assessment represents the ultimate goal of formative assessment: pupils who can regulate their own learning. **The EEF (2018)** identifies self-regulated learning as high-impact but notes it requires explicit teaching.

**Self-assessment strategies in English:**

- **Self-marking**: Pupils mark their own work against provided answers or criteria
- **Self-editing**: Pupils revise their own writing using checklists
- **Self-reflection**: Pupils evaluate their learning against lesson objectives

**Developing self-assessment capability:**

1. **Start with concrete criteria**: Begin with checklist-style self-assessment ("Did I use at least three fronted adverbials?")
2. **Progress to evaluative criteria**: Move toward more judgement-based assessment ("How effectively did I create suspense?")
3. **Make thinking visible**: Require pupils to explain their self-assessment ("Why did you rate your opening as effective?")

### 5.4 Common Misconceptions About Peer and Self-Assessment

Teachers often encounter resistance to peer and self-assessment based on misconceptions:

**"Pupils aren't qualified to assess"**: While true in an absolute sense, peer assessment is a learning activity, not a replacement for teacher assessment. The process of attempting assessment develops understanding even if the assessment itself is imperfect.

**"It's just pupils ticking boxes"**: When reduced to mechanical checklists, peer assessment can be superficial. Quality peer assessment requires thoughtful engagement with success criteria and genuine evaluative judgement.

**"Lower-attaining pupils can't do it"**: All pupils can engage with peer and self-assessment when appropriately scaffolded. Lower-attaining pupils may benefit particularly from the concrete focus on success criteria.

## Part 6: Formative Assessment Across Key Stages

### 6.1 Key Stage 1 (Ages 5-7)

Formative assessment in KS1 English focuses heavily on **oral feedback** and **immediate response**. The **DfE's Teacher Assessment Frameworks** at KS1 rely on teacher judgement informed by ongoing classroom interaction.

**Key strategies:**
- **Interactive writing**: Collaborative composition where the teacher scribes and pupils contribute
- **Guided reading**: Small-group instruction with immediate feedback on decoding and comprehension
- **Phonics assessment**: Regular checking of GPC (grapheme-phoneme correspondence) knowledge

The **Year 1 Phonics Screening Check** provides summative data, but day-to-day formative assessment drives teaching. Teachers should monitor pupils' blending and segmenting abilities to identify those requiring additional support.

### 6.2 Key Stage 2 (Ages 7-11)

As pupils develop independence, KS2 formative assessment increasingly emphasises **self-regulation** and **peer collaboration**.

**Key developments:**
- **Editing stations**: Pupils move between focused editing tasks (punctuation, vocabulary, structure)
- **Reading response journals**: Regular low-stakes written responses to reading that inform teaching
- **Spelling diagnostics**: Analysis of spelling errors to identify patterns and inform teaching

The **Key Stage 2 Reading and Grammar, Punctuation and Spelling tests** provide end-of-key-stage summative data, but should not dominate formative practice. **Ofsted (2022)** warns against "teaching to the test" and emphasises the importance of a broad, rich English curriculum.

### 6.3 Key Stage 3 (Ages 11-14)

KS3 represents a critical period for developing **academic writing** and **literary analysis**. Formative assessment at this stage must balance the development of technical accuracy with growing sophistication in analysis and expression.

**KS3 priorities:**
- **Essay structure**: Using success criteria that emphasise paragraph construction, topic sentences, and evidence integration
- **Analytical language**: Developing the metalanguage needed for literary criticism
- **Drafting processes**: Teaching revision as a substantive part of writing rather than mere correction

**Ofsted's English Research Review** (2022) emphasises that KS3 should not be dominated by GCSE preparation. Formative assessment should support a rich, varied curriculum rather than premature examination focus.

### 6.4 Key Stage 4 and 5 (Ages 14-18)

At GCSE and A-Level, formative assessment must serve **examination preparation** while maintaining focus on genuine learning. The challenge lies in ensuring that assessment enhances rather than narrows the curriculum.

**Effective formative assessment at this level:**
- **Question-level analysis**: Using past paper performance data diagnostically to identify skill gaps
- **Examiner-style commentary**: Providing feedback that mimics examiner language while remaining formative
- **Portfolio development**: Using collections of work to demonstrate progress over time

The **A-Level English** specifications (AQA, OCR, Eduqas, Edexcel) all emphasise independent reading and research. Formative assessment should support these processes through:
- **Research check-ins**: Regular brief meetings to discuss independent study progress
- **Draft thesis statements**: Early feedback on essay arguments before full drafts
- **Critical reading logs**: Ongoing documentation of independent reading that informs tutorial conversations

## Part 7: Practical Implementation and Departmental Development

### 7.1 Building a Formative Assessment Culture

Implementing formative assessment effectively requires more than individual teacher skill—it demands **departmental culture change**. The following strategies support whole-department development:

**Assessment literacy training**: Ensure all teachers understand the research base and can articulate why particular strategies are used. This builds professional ownership and enables intelligent adaptation.

**Shared protocols**: Develop agreed approaches for common practices (e.g., peer assessment protocols, whole-class feedback formats). Consistency across teachers supports pupils in internalising expectations.

**Collaborative inquiry**: Use departmental meeting time to analyse pupil work together, identifying common patterns and developing responsive teaching. This builds collective expertise and reduces isolation.

### 7.2 Addressing Common Challenges

**Challenge: Pupils don't act on feedback**

**Solutions:**
- Build **DIRT (Dedicated Improvement and Reflection Time)** into lessons
- Require pupils to respond to feedback in writing before submitting improvements
- Make feedback actionable—vague comments produce vague responses

**Challenge: Peer assessment feels superficial**

**Solutions:**
- Start with highly structured protocols and gradually release responsibility
- Model the assessment process using anonymised work
- Use peer assessment for specific, focused aspects rather than entire pieces

**Challenge: Time constraints prevent quality feedback**

**Solutions:**
- Prioritise verbal feedback during writing processes
- Use whole-class feedback to address common issues efficiently
- Focus written feedback on a limited number of specific targets

**Challenge: Pupils become dependent on teacher feedback**

**Solutions:**
- Gradually increase the complexity of self-assessment tasks
- Require pupils to identify their own areas for improvement before receiving teacher feedback
- Use "three before me" protocols (pupils must try three strategies before asking the teacher)

### 7.3 Digital Tools for Formative Assessment

While this file focuses on pedagogical strategies rather than specific technologies, several digital approaches merit mention:

**Document cameras/visualisers**: Enable live sharing and annotation of pupil work, making the assessment process visible and collaborative.

**Collaborative documents**: Shared writing spaces allow real-time feedback and peer commentary during the composition process.

**Online quiz platforms**: Tools like Socrative, Kahoot, or Quizizz can provide immediate diagnostic data on comprehension, though they should supplement rather than replace more sophisticated assessment approaches.

**Audio feedback**: Recording verbal feedback can be more time-efficient than extensive written comments while preserving the personal, interactive quality of spoken feedback.

The **Education Endowment Foundation (2021)** cautions that technology in assessment is only effective when it supports well-designed pedagogy. Digital tools should not replace thoughtful teacher judgement or meaningful pupil-teacher interaction.

## Part 8: Case Studies in Formative Assessment

### Case Study 1: Developing Analytical Writing in Year 9

**Context**: A mixed-ability Year 9 class studying Shakespeare's "Macbeth"

**Challenge**: Pupils were summarising plot rather than analysing how Shakespeare creates meaning through language and structure.

**Formative assessment approach**:
1. **Co-constructed success criteria**: Pupils analysed two contrasting paragraphs (one plot summary, one analysis) to identify what made the analytical paragraph effective
2. **Hinge questions**: After each scene, hinge questions checked whether pupils could identify the difference between description and analysis
3. **Structured peer assessment**: Partners used a protocol focusing specifically on analytical moves (quotation selection, terminology use, explanation of effect)
4. **Whole-class feedback**: The teacher identified three common patterns—over-quotation, insufficient explanation, and missed structural opportunities—and taught a specific lesson addressing each

**Outcome**: By the end of the unit, 85% of pupils were achieving analytical writing at or above age-related expectations, compared to 45% at the start.

### Case Study 2: Supporting Struggling Writers in Year 7

**Context**: A Year 7 class with significant numbers below expected standard in writing

**Challenge**: Pupils lacked confidence and produced minimal writing; feedback felt overwhelming when it identified numerous issues.

**Formative assessment approach**:
1. **Single-focus feedback**: Each piece received feedback on only one aspect (sentence variety, then punctuation, then vocabulary)
2. **Live modelling**: Regular shared writing sessions demonstrated the writing process, including decision-making and revision
3. **Self-assessment checklists**: Visual checklists with specific, concrete criteria supported independence
4. **Verbal conferencing**: Brief 1:1 conversations during writing time provided immediate, personalised support

**Outcome**: Writing volume increased by an average of 40%, and pupils reported greater confidence in their writing ability.

### Case Study 3: Preparing for GCSE English Literature

**Context**: Year 11 class preparing for AQA GCSE English Literature

**Challenge**: Pupils could write about texts but struggled to meet examination time pressures and specific question requirements.

**Formative assessment approach**:
1. **Timed practice with immediate feedback**: Regular timed responses with question-level analysis of what was/wasn't achieved
2. **Examiner-style commentary**: Feedback referenced mark scheme descriptors, helping pupils understand examination criteria
3. **Self-assessment against criteria**: Pupils evaluated their own work against level descriptors before receiving teacher feedback
4. **Targeted revision**: Feedback identified specific poems or characters requiring additional revision

**Outcome**: Mock examination results showed an average improvement of one grade compared to previous assessments.

## Part 9: Conclusion and Key Recommendations

Formative assessment in English is not a single technique but a comprehensive approach to teaching that positions assessment as an integral part of learning rather than an end in itself. The following principles guide effective implementation:

### Core Principles

1. **Feedback must inform action**: Assessment that doesn't change teaching or learning is wasted effort. Every formative assessment should lead to a specific instructional response.

2. **Pupil agency is essential**: The goal is pupils who can regulate their own learning. Peer and self-assessment are not workload-reduction strategies but essential learning activities.

3. **Quality trumps quantity**: More marking does not produce better learning. Focused, actionable feedback on specific aspects of performance is more effective than comprehensive error correction.

4. **English is affective**: Writing and reading involve personal investment. Feedback must balance challenge with support, accuracy with encouragement.

5. **Progression is developmental**: Formative assessment should map onto clear developmental trajectories, helping pupils understand where they are and where they're going.

### Implementation Recommendations

**For individual teachers:**
- Start with one formative assessment strategy and implement it consistently before adding others
- Use hinge questions to make in-lesson assessment routine
- Build DIRT time into every scheme of work
- Experiment with whole-class feedback to manage workload

**For department leaders:**
- Develop shared language and protocols for formative assessment
- Use collaborative inquiry to build collective expertise
- Review marking policies to ensure they support learning without creating unsustainable workload
- Provide time for teachers to analyse pupil work together

**For school leaders:**
- Ensure assessment policies prioritise learning over data generation
- Protect teacher time for meaningful feedback activities
- Support professional development in assessment literacy
- Evaluate assessment practices based on their impact on learning, not their appearance in books
