# A Level English Specifications: A Comprehensive Guide for Teachers

## Overview of A Level English Qualifications in England

A Level English qualifications in England are offered by four awarding bodies: AQA, Pearson Edexcel, OCR, and WJEC Eduqas. Each board provides specifications for three distinct qualifications: English Language, English Literature, and English Language and Literature (combined). These qualifications were first taught in 2015 following curriculum reforms that emphasised linear assessment, terminal examinations, and rigorous disciplinary knowledge. Understanding the nuances between specifications is essential for curriculum leaders making decisions about which qualification best serves their students' needs.

The 2015 reforms fundamentally reshaped A Level English. AS Levels were decoupled from A Levels, meaning AS results no longer count towards the full A Level grade. All specifications now emphasise terminal assessment, with most boards weighting examinations at 80% and non-exam assessment (NEA) at 20%. The reforms also introduced a common set of assessment objectives across all boards, ensuring consistency in what students are expected to demonstrate, though the ways in which these objectives are tested vary significantly between specifications.

For teachers and curriculum leaders, choosing between specifications involves weighing multiple factors: the structure of examination papers, the nature of NEA tasks, the prescribed texts or topic areas, the availability of resources and professional development, and the specification's alignment with departmental expertise. This guide provides a detailed comparison of all four awarding bodies across all three qualification types.

## Assessment Objectives: The Common Framework

### The Five Assessment Objectives

All A Level English specifications share the same assessment objectives (AOs), mandated by Ofqual. These objectives define what students must demonstrate, though the weighting differs between English Language, English Literature, and combined specifications.

**AO1: Articulate informed, personal and creative responses to texts, using associated concepts and terminology, and coherent, accurate written expression.** This objective underpins all assessment, requiring students to communicate their ideas clearly and deploy subject-specific terminology appropriately. Across all specifications, AO1 typically carries significant weighting, emphasising the importance of written communication skills.

**AO2: Analyse ways in which meanings are shaped in texts.** This objective focuses on the how of textual analysis—how writers and speakers craft their work to create particular effects. For English Literature, this means analysing literary devices and authorial choices. For English Language, it involves analysing linguistic features and their effects on audiences.

**AO3: Demonstrate understanding of the significance and influence of the contexts in which texts are produced and received.** Contextual understanding is assessed across all specifications, though the nature of context varies. Literature specifications emphasise literary, historical, and social contexts of literary texts. Language specifications focus on social, cultural, and historical contexts of language use and variation.

**AO4: Explore connections across texts, informed by linguistic and literary concepts and methods.** This objective is particularly significant in English Language specifications, where students must apply linguistic frameworks consistently. In Literature, it connects to comparative analysis and thematic connections.

**AO5: Demonstrate expertise and creativity in the use of English as appropriate.** This applies specifically to English Language and combined specifications, where students produce original writing as part of their NEA. It rewards creative and technical proficiency in students' own writing.

### Weighting Variations by Specification Type

English Language specifications typically weight AO1, AO2, AO3, and AO4 most heavily, with AO5 assessed through the original writing component of NEA. English Literature specifications distribute weighting across AO1-AO4, with no AO5. Combined Language and Literature specifications must balance all five objectives, typically giving significant weighting to AO5 through original writing tasks.

Understanding these weightings is crucial for teaching. A specification with high AO3 weighting demands substantial contextual teaching. One emphasising AO4 requires extensive work on linguistic frameworks or comparative analysis. Teachers must align their curriculum planning with these weightings to ensure students are prepared for the specific demands of their examination.

## AQA Specifications

### AQA English Language (7702)

AQA's English Language specification is the most popular choice in England, taken by approximately 70% of A Level English Language students. The specification emphasises linguistic analysis and original writing, with a clear structure that many teachers find accessible and logical.

The specification is divided into two examination papers and one NEA component. **Paper 1: Language, the Individual and Society** (2 hours 30 minutes, 40% of A Level) focuses on textual variation and representation. Section A requires analysis of two texts linked by theme (one contemporary, one older), testing AO1, AO2, and AO3. Section B focuses on children's language development, requiring analysis of spoken or written data from children at different developmental stages. This section uniquely tests AO4 alongside the other objectives.

**Paper 2: Language Diversity and Change** (2 hours 30 minutes, 40% of A Level) examines language in its wider social contexts. Section A focuses on language diversity—how language varies according to ethnicity, gender, occupation, and social group. Students analyse texts demonstrating these variations. Section B addresses language change, tracing the history of English from 1600 to the present day. An essay question requires students to evaluate attitudes to language change and variation, drawing on their wider reading and the specification's anthologies.

The **NEA: Language in Action** (20% of A Level) comprises two equally weighted components: a language investigation (2000 words) and original writing (1500 words with commentary). The investigation allows students to explore an area of language use that interests them—perhaps the language of advertising, the representation of a particular social group, or language change in a specific domain. Students formulate their own research question, collect data, apply linguistic frameworks, and draw conclusions. The original writing component requires students to produce two pieces for different audiences and purposes, accompanied by a commentary analysing their own language choices.

AQA provides substantial support materials, including anthologies of texts for Paper 2, sample assessment materials, and extensive professional development opportunities. The specification's popularity means that resources, revision guides, and teacher communities are widely available. However, the popularity also means that examiner expectations are highly refined, and meeting the top mark descriptors requires precise, sophisticated analysis.

### AQA English Literature A (7712)

AQA's Literature A specification is the most widely taken Literature qualification in England, chosen by approximately 70% of centres. The specification balances examined and non-examined assessment while offering flexibility in text choices.

The specification comprises two papers and one NEA component. **Paper 1: Love Through the Ages** (3 hours, 40% of A Level) is the most substantial examination, requiring students to study texts across three genres: Shakespeare, drama, and poetry. Section A requires response to Shakespeare (a closed-book extract question on *Othello*, *The Taming of the Shrew*, *Measure for Measure*, or *The Winter's Tale*). Section B covers drama (students study one text from a list including *The Duchess of Malfi*, *A Streetcar Named Desire*, and *The Homecoming*). Section C covers poetry, with students studying one of four anthologies and comparing a set text with an unseen poem on the theme of love.

**Paper 2: Texts in Shared Contexts** (2 hours 30 minutes, 40% of A Level) offers choice between three options: World War One and Aftermath, Modern Times (1945-present), or Struggle for Identity in Modern Literature. Students study three texts from their chosen context: one prose, one poetry, and one drama. The paper includes a compulsory prose question, a poetry comparison, and an open question on drama.

The **NEA: Independent Critical Study: Texts Across Time** (20% of A Level) requires students to write one extended essay of 2500-3000 words comparing two texts, at least one of which must be pre-1900. Students develop their own question with teacher guidance, allowing them to pursue individual interests. The task tests AO1-AO4 simultaneously, requiring students to articulate personal responses, analyse methods, understand contexts, and explore connections across time periods.

### AQA English Literature B (7717)

AQA's Literature B specification offers an alternative approach, with 30% of centres choosing this option. The specification places greater emphasis on critical theory and different readings of texts.

The NEA component, **Theory and Independence** (20% of A Level), requires two essays of 1250-1500 words, each responding to a different text and linking to a different aspect of the Critical Anthology provided by AQA. The Critical Anthology includes extracts on Narrative, Feminism, Marxism, Eco-criticism, Post-colonialism, and Tragedy. One essay can be re-creative, accompanied by a commentary. This structure explicitly teaches students to apply critical lenses to literary texts, developing their understanding of how interpretation is shaped by theoretical frameworks.

### AQA English Language and Literature (7707)

The combined specification integrates linguistic and literary study, appealing to students and departments wanting to maintain breadth. **Paper 1: Telling Stories** (3 hours, 40% of A Level) focuses on narrative methods across genres. **Paper 2: Exploring Conflict** (2 hours 30 minutes, 40% of A Level) examines representations of conflict in various text types. The **NEA: Making Connections** (20% of A Level) requires a 2500-3000 word investigation making productive connections between a literary text and non-literary material.

## Pearson Edexcel Specifications

### Edexcel English Language (9EN0)

Edexcel's English Language specification, taken by approximately 15% of students, offers a distinct structure that some teachers find more coherent than AQA's approach. The specification organises content around four conceptual areas: Language Variation, Language and Context, Language in Use, and Original Writing.

**Paper 1: Language Variation** (2 hours 15 minutes, 35% of A Level) focuses on how language varies according to individual and social factors. Section A examines individual variation—how a person's language use reflects their identity, background, and circumstances. Section B addresses social variation—how language varies across social groups and contexts. Both sections require analysis of provided texts and essays evaluating language variation theories.

**Paper 2: Child Language** (1 hour, 20% of A Level) is a dedicated paper examining spoken and written language development from 0-11 years. This focused assessment allows for depth of coverage, with students analysing child language data and explaining developmental patterns using linguistic frameworks.

**Paper 3: Investigating Language** (1 hour 45 minutes, 25% of A Level) is unique to Edexcel. Students research a topic area in advance (choosing from options like Language and Gender, Language and Journalism, or Language and Technology) and answer questions drawing on this research. The paper tests students' ability to apply linguistic knowledge to specific questions and evaluate research findings.

The **NEA** (20% of A Level) comprises a language investigation (2000 words) and original writing (1500 words with commentary), similar in structure to AQA but with Edexcel's specific requirements for task selection and focus.

### Edexcel English Literature (9ET0)

Edexcel's Literature specification offers a structure that some teachers find more straightforward than AQA's. The specification organises content around three examined components and NEA.

**Paper 1: Drama** (2 hours 15 minutes, 30% of A Level) requires study of two plays: one Shakespeare and one other drama. The paper includes extract questions on both texts and an essay connecting the two, testing AO1-AO4 in an integrated manner.

**Paper 2: Prose** (1 hour 15 minutes, 20% of A Level) requires comparative study of two prose texts, at least one of which must be pre-1900. The paper requires one comparative essay on the two studied texts.

**Paper 3: Poetry** (2 hours 15 minutes, 30% of A Level) has a distinctive structure. Section A covers the prescribed poetry anthology (post-2000 poetry). Section B requires study of a specific poet or movement from a list including Keats, Rossetti, Chaucer, and the Metaphysical Poets. Students answer one question on the anthology and one on their studied poet/movement.

The **NEA** (20% of A Level) requires one 2500-3000 word essay comparing two texts, one of which must be pre-1900. Students have free choice of texts, allowing departments to select materials that match their expertise and student interests.

### Edexcel English Language and Literature (9EL0)

The combined specification integrates literary and linguistic study through **Paper 1: Voices in Speech and Writing** (2 hours 30 minutes, 40% of A Level) and **Paper 2: Varieties in Language and Literature** (2 hours 30 minutes, 40% of A Level). The NEA (20%) requires original writing with commentary and an analytical comparison of literary and non-literary texts.

## OCR Specifications

### OCR English Language (H470)

OCR's English Language specification, taken by approximately 10% of students, offers a distinctive structure with dedicated components for different language topics. The specification emphasises exploring language in social contexts.

**Paper 1: Exploring Language** (2 hours 30 minutes, 40% of A Level) focuses on language variation and representation. Section A requires analysis of two texts on the same topic but from different time periods or genres. Section B addresses language issues through essay questions on topics like language and gender, language and technology, or language change.

**Paper 2: Dimensions of Linguistic Variation** (2 hours 30 minutes, 40% of A Level) examines child language acquisition and language in the media. Section A focuses on children's language development (0-11 years), with analysis of spoken and written data. Section B addresses language in the media, examining how media texts construct representations and engage audiences.

The **NEA: Independent Language Research** (20% of A Level) comprises a language investigation (2000 words) and original writing (1500 words with commentary), similar in scope to other boards but with OCR's specific guidance on topic selection.

### OCR English Literature (H072/H472)

OCR's Literature specification offers a structure that emphasises the exploration of different literary periods and movements. **Paper 1: Drama and Poetry Pre-1900** (2 hours 30 minutes, 40% of A Level) requires study of one Shakespeare play and one pre-1900 poetry text. **Paper 2: Comparative and Contextual Study** (2 hours 30 minutes, 40% of A Level) offers topic areas including American Literature, The Gothic, Dystopia, and Women in Literature. Students study two prose texts from their chosen area and answer one comparative question plus an unseen question.

The **NEA** (20% of A Level) requires a close reading essay (1000 words) on a passage from a studied text and a comparative essay (2000 words) on two texts from different periods, one of which must be pre-1900. This split structure tests detailed textual analysis separately from broader comparative skills.

### OCR English Language and Literature (H474)

Developed in partnership with the English and Media Centre (EMC), this combined specification integrates linguistic and literary study through an EMC-approved approach. **Paper 1: Exploring Non-Fiction and Spoken Texts** (2 hours 30 minutes, 40% of A Level) and **Paper 2: The Language of Poetry and Plays** (2 hours 30 minutes, 40% of A Level) build integrated skills. The NEA (20%) requires reading and writing non-fiction (2000 words total) and an analytical essay comparing literary and non-literary texts (2000 words).

## WJEC Eduqas Specifications

### Eduqas English Language (A710)

WJEC Eduqas, taken by approximately 5% of students, offers specifications with distinctive features that appeal to certain departments. The English Language specification emphasises creative and critical engagement with language.

**Component 1: Language Concepts and Issues** (2 hours, 30% of A Level) requires analysis of spoken language transcripts and an essay on language issues (such as language and power, language and gender, or language change). **Component 2: Language Change Over Time** (2 hours, 30% of A Level) focuses on historical language change and twenty-first century language development, with analysis of texts from different periods and an essay evaluating language change theories.

**Component 3: Creative and Critical Use of Language** (2 hours, 20% of A Level) is unique to Eduqas. This examined component requires two pieces of original writing for different audiences and purposes, accompanied by analytical commentaries. Unlike other boards, where original writing is NEA, Eduqas examines this component, meaning all assessment is externally marked.

The **NEA: Language and Identity** (20% of A Level) comprises a language investigation focused on how individuals or groups use language to construct identity. This focused topic area gives coherence to the research process while allowing student choice within the identity theme.

### Eduqas English Literature

Eduqas Literature offers **Component 1: Poetry** (2 hours, 30% of A Level) covering post-1900 and pre-1900 poetry, **Component 2: Drama** (2 hours, 30% of A Level) covering Shakespeare and one other drama text, and **Component 3: Unseen Texts** (2 hours, 20% of A Level) requiring analysis of unseen poetry and prose. The **NEA** (20% of A Level) requires a 2500-3500 word extended essay on two texts, at least one pre-1900.

### Eduqas English Language and Literature

The combined specification follows a similar structure, with examined components covering poetry and drama (30%), prose (30%), and unseen analysis (20%), plus NEA (20%) requiring an investigative analysis of spoken or written language in use.

## NEA Requirements: Cross-Board Comparison

### Word Counts and Weightings

All specifications weight NEA at 20% of the final A Level, with the exception of the legacy linear arrangements. However, the structure and requirements vary significantly between boards.

**English Language NEA** across all boards comprises two components: a language investigation (2000 words for AQA, Edexcel, OCR; 2500 words for Eduqas) and original writing (1500 words for AQA, Edexcel, OCR; 1500 words plus commentary for Eduqas). AQA and Edexcel weight these components equally within the 20%. OCR and Eduqas have similar structures but with their own specific guidance.

**English Literature NEA** varies more substantially. AQA Literature A requires one 2500-3000 word comparative essay. AQA Literature B requires two 1250-1500 word essays (one of which may be re-creative with commentary). Edexcel requires one 2500-3000 word comparative essay. OCR splits the NEA into two parts: a 1000-word close reading and a 2000-word comparative essay. Eduqas requires one extended essay of 2500-3500 words.

**Combined specifications** require integrated tasks making connections between literary and non-literary texts. AQA requires a 2500-3000 word investigation. OCR requires 2000 words of non-fiction reading and writing plus a 2000-word comparative essay. Edexcel requires original writing with commentary plus an analytical comparison.

### Administrative Requirements

All boards have similar administrative requirements for NEA: authentication statements confirming the work is the student's own, supervision protocols, and marking criteria that must be applied consistently. However, specific requirements for annotation, sample selection for moderation, and submission procedures vary. Teachers should consult the current year's JCQ instructions and the individual board's NEA administration guides for precise details.

## Pedagogical Considerations for Specification Selection

### Department Expertise and Resources

When selecting a specification, curriculum leaders must honestly assess departmental expertise. AQA's specifications have the most extensive resource ecosystems—published textbooks, revision guides, online materials, and established teacher communities. For departments building A Level provision or with limited specialist expertise, this support infrastructure is invaluable.

Edexcel and OCR specifications may suit departments with established expertise in specific areas. Edexcel's English Language, with its dedicated Child Language paper, appeals to departments with strong linguistics backgrounds. OCR's EMC partnership appeals to departments wanting integrated language and literature approaches.

### Student Cohort Characteristics

Different specifications suit different student profiles. AQA English Language's popularity means extensive past paper resources for practice, but also means the standard is highly competitive. Edexcel's structure, with three examined papers including one specifically on pre-researched topics, may suit students who benefit from knowing examination content in advance.

For Literature, AQA's thematic structure (Love Through the Ages; Texts in Shared Contexts) provides coherence that some students find helpful. Edexcel's genre-based structure (Drama, Prose, Poetry) aligns with how many departments naturally organise their teaching. OCR's context-based approach (American Literature, The Gothic) suits students interested in studying literature through historical and cultural lenses.

### University and Career Preparation

All A Level English qualifications are valued by universities, but some specifications may offer better preparation for particular pathways. Specifications with substantial NEA components develop independent research skills valuable for undergraduate study. AQA Literature B's critical theory focus provides excellent preparation for English degrees with strong theoretical components. Language specifications with detailed investigation components prepare students for linguistics and social science courses.

## Common Misconceptions in A Level English Teaching

### Misconception 1: NEA is Less Rigorous than Examination

Some teachers and students perceive NEA as somehow easier than terminal examinations. This is incorrect. NEA tasks are designed to be equally demanding, testing the same assessment objectives through different formats. The extended time and research opportunities in NEA are balanced by higher expectations for depth, independence, and sophistication. A 2500-word comparative essay requires more sustained analysis than a 45-minute examination response.

### Misconception 2: All Specifications are Essentially the Same

While sharing assessment objectives, specifications have distinct identities and demands. AQA English Language Paper 2's focus on attitudes to language change is quite different from OCR's media-focused Paper 2. Literature specifications differ substantially in their approach to unseen texts, comparative analysis, and contextual study. Teachers cannot assume expertise transfers directly between specifications without careful study of the specific requirements.

### Misconception 3: More Popular Specifications are Easier

AQA's dominance does not indicate easier assessment. If anything, the refinement of examiner expectations over years of high entry means that achieving top grades requires highly sophisticated responses. Less popular specifications may offer advantages in terms of manageable class sizes for moderation or more distinctive profiles that help university applications stand out.

## Teaching Strategies Across Specifications

### Developing Analytical Precision

All specifications reward precise, technically accurate analysis. Teachers should prioritise developing students' ability to identify specific linguistic or literary features and explain their effects with precision. Generic comments about "creating effect" or "engaging the reader" are insufficient. Students need to connect specific techniques to specific impacts on meaning, tone, or reader response.

### Building Contextual Understanding

AO3 is assessed across all specifications, but contextual knowledge must be deployed effectively. Context should illuminate textual analysis rather than displace it. Students need to understand how contexts shaped production (authorial contexts, historical circumstances, literary movements) and how contexts shape reception (how different audiences interpret texts differently across time and culture).

### Supporting Independent Research

NEA components require students to work independently—a significant transition from GCSE. Teachers need to scaffold this independence carefully, providing clear guidance on research ethics, source evaluation, and academic integrity while allowing students genuine ownership of their questions and approaches.

## Conclusion: Choosing with Confidence

Selecting an A Level English specification requires balancing multiple factors: departmental expertise, resource availability, student characteristics, and strategic priorities. No specification is objectively best; each offers distinct advantages and challenges.

AQA specifications provide the most comprehensive support infrastructure and are sensible defaults for departments establishing or consolidating A Level provision. Edexcel and OCR offer distinctive structures that may better suit specific departmental strengths or student needs. WJEC Eduqas provides alternatives that may appeal to departments seeking differentiation.

What matters most is not which specification is chosen, but how well teachers understand their chosen specification's requirements and how effectively they prepare students to meet them. Deep engagement with assessment objectives, mark schemes, and examiner reports—whichever board is selected—remains the foundation of successful A Level English teaching.
