# Components and Composites in English Curriculum Design

## Overview

The concepts of components and composites provide a powerful framework for designing and sequencing English curricula. This architectural approach, borrowed from mastery mathematics education and adapted for English, recognises that complex skills—such as writing analytical essays or constructing persuasive arguments—are themselves composites built from smaller, teachable components. Understanding how to break down complex tasks into their constituent parts, and how to sequence these components from foundational to complex, lies at the heart of effective English curriculum design.

English presents particular challenges for component-composite thinking because the subject encompasses multiple domains—reading, writing, speaking and listening—that develop interdependently yet require distinct instructional attention. Unlike subjects with more linear progression models, English demands both horizontal breadth (across different text types and purposes) and vertical depth (increasing sophistication within each domain).

This knowledge file explores how English teachers and curriculum designers can apply component-composite thinking to create coherent, progressive curricula that ensure all pupils develop the foundational building blocks necessary for advanced literary and linguistic study.

## Foundational Concepts

### Defining Components

Components in English are the discrete, teachable elements that combine to form more complex skills. They are:

- **Specific and identifiable**: Components can be named, defined and assessed
- **Prerequisite**: Mastery of components enables access to more complex tasks
- **Transferable**: Components apply across multiple contexts and text types
- **Practisable**: Components can be isolated for focused instruction and deliberate practice

Examples of components in English include:

**Reading Components:**
- Decoding grapheme-phoneme correspondences
- Recognising common word patterns and morphemes
- Identifying sentence boundaries and clause structures
- Locating explicit information in texts
- Making simple inferences from textual evidence
- Recognising basic narrative structure (orientation, complication, resolution)

**Writing Components:**
- Forming letters accurately and consistently
- Constructing grammatically complete sentences
- Using basic punctuation marks (full stops, capital letters, question marks)
- Spelling high-frequency words correctly
- Using cohesive devices within sentences (conjunctions, pronouns)
- Organising sentences into simple paragraphs

**Literature Components:**
- Identifying genre conventions
- Recognising literary devices (simile, metaphor, personification)
- Distinguishing between narrator and author
- Identifying basic character types and motivations
- Recognising setting and its significance
- Understanding dialogue conventions

### Defining Composites

Composites are the complex, multidimensional performances that emerge when multiple components are orchestrated together in authentic contexts. Composites are:

- **Complex and multidimensional**: Multiple components operating simultaneously
- **Context-dependent**: Composites vary according to purpose, audience and genre
- **Evaluable**: Composites can be judged against quality criteria
- **Transferable**: Once mastered, composites can be applied to new situations

Examples of composites in English include:

**Reading Composites:**
- Reading and comprehending extended narrative texts independently
- Analysing how writers create meaning through language and structure
- Comparing themes and ideas across multiple texts
- Evaluating critical perspectives on literary works
- Synthesising information from multiple sources

**Writing Composites:**
- Writing coherent, extended narratives with developed characters and settings
- Constructing persuasive arguments with evidence and rhetorical devices
- Producing analytical essays comparing literary texts
- Crafting creative non-fiction that engages readers
- Adapting writing for different audiences and purposes

**Literature Composites:**
- Developing sustained interpretations of complex literary texts
- Evaluating how historical and cultural contexts shape literary meaning
- Analysing intertextual relationships between works
- Constructing original critical arguments about canonical and contemporary texts

### The Component-Composite Relationship

The relationship between components and composites is not merely aggregative but transformative. When components combine, they create emergent properties that none possess individually. Consider:

- A pupil may know how to identify a metaphor (component) and understand narrative structure (component), but analysing how metaphor contributes to narrative meaning (composite) requires integration of these elements in ways that transcend simple addition
- Similarly, a pupil may write grammatically accurate sentences (component) and organise ideas into paragraphs (component), yet crafting prose that achieves a particular tone or effect (composite) demands orchestration of these skills with awareness of reader, purpose and genre

This transformative relationship has significant pedagogical implications. Teaching components in isolation, without attention to how they combine into composites, produces pupils who can perform discrete tasks but struggle with authentic reading and writing. Conversely, attempting to teach composites without securing foundational components risks overwhelming pupils and embedding error.

## Components in Reading

### Foundational Reading Components

**Phonemic Awareness and Phonics**

The earliest reading components concern the relationship between sounds and symbols:

- **Phonemic awareness**: Recognising and manipulating individual sounds in spoken words
- **Grapheme-phoneme correspondence**: Linking letters and letter combinations to sounds
- **Blending**: Combining sounds to read unfamiliar words
- **Segmenting**: Breaking words into component sounds for spelling

These components, emphasised in systematic synthetic phonics programmes, are foundational because they enable pupils to decode unfamiliar words independently. Without secure phonics, pupils cannot access the wider curriculum and their reading development stalls.

**Word Recognition and Fluency**

As decoding becomes automatic, attention shifts to:

- **Sight vocabulary**: Recognising high-frequency words automatically
- **Morphemic awareness**: Understanding how prefixes, suffixes and root words contribute to meaning
- **Reading fluency**: Reading with appropriate pace, accuracy and prosody
- **Self-correction**: Monitoring comprehension and repairing breakdowns

Fluency serves as a bridge between decoding and comprehension. Pupils who read fluently can allocate cognitive resources to meaning-making rather than word-level processing.

### Comprehension Components

**Literal Comprehension**

Before inference and analysis, pupils must retrieve explicit information:

- Locating specific details in texts
- Identifying explicitly stated main ideas
- Following chronological sequences
- Recognising explicitly stated relationships between ideas

Literal comprehension provides the foundation upon which higher-order reading is built. Pupils cannot interpret what they have not first understood.

**Inferential Comprehension**

Reading between the lines requires:

- Drawing conclusions from textual evidence
- Understanding implied meanings and subtext
- Recognising character motivations not explicitly stated
- Inferring settings and contexts from textual clues

Inference depends on both textual knowledge (what the text says) and world knowledge (what readers bring to the text). Teaching inference explicitly—modelling how readers use evidence to reach conclusions—develops this crucial component.

**Evaluative Comprehension**

Critical reading involves:

- Assessing the reliability of narrators and sources
- Evaluating the effectiveness of authorial choices
- Recognising bias, perspective and ideological positioning
- Comparing interpretations and perspectives

Evaluative comprehension represents advanced reading, yet its components can be taught progressively from early years through to A Level.

### Reading Composites

**Reading Composite: Sustained Independent Reading**

When pupils read extended texts independently with good comprehension, they are performing a composite skill combining:

- Automatic decoding
- Fluent prosodic reading
- Ongoing comprehension monitoring
- Inference and prediction
- Vocabulary knowledge
- Text-type understanding
- Stamina and motivation

Each of these elements is a component that requires explicit teaching; their integration into independent reading is the composite goal.

**Reading Composite: Critical Literary Analysis**

Analytical reading of literature requires orchestration of:

- Close reading of textual detail
- Recognition of literary and rhetorical devices
- Understanding of genre conventions and their subversion
- Awareness of historical and cultural contexts
- Engagement with critical perspectives
- Construction of interpretive arguments

This composite, developed throughout secondary education, represents sophisticated reading that prepares pupils for higher education.

## Components in Writing

### Transcription Components

**Handwriting and Presentation**

The physical production of writing involves:

- Letter formation (shape, orientation, size)
- Consistent sizing and spacing
- Appropriate pencil grip and posture
- Joining letters fluently (when taught)
- Presenting work clearly for readers

While transcription may seem basic, difficulties here impede composition. Pupils who struggle with letter formation cannot concentrate on higher-level writing demands.

**Spelling**

Spelling components include:

- Phonemic strategies (sound-symbol correspondence)
- Morphological strategies (understanding word parts)
- Etymological strategies (word histories)
- Visual strategies (recognising word shapes)
- Using spelling patterns and rules

Effective spelling instruction addresses all these components explicitly, recognising that English spelling represents multiple linguistic systems operating together.

**Punctuation**

Punctuation components progress from:

- Basic sentence demarcation (full stops, capital letters)
- Separating clauses (commas, conjunctions)
- Indicating direct speech
- Using apostrophes for contraction and possession
- Deploying punctuation for effect (colons, semicolons, dashes)

Each mark represents a component that can be taught explicitly, practised deliberately and applied in increasingly complex contexts.

### Grammar and Syntax Components

**Sentence Construction**

At the heart of writing development lies sentence-level work:

- Writing simple sentences with subject and verb
- Expanding sentences through modification (adjectives, adverbs, prepositional phrases)
- Combining sentences through coordination
- Creating complex sentences through subordination
- Varying sentence openings and structures for effect

Sentence combining research demonstrates that teaching these components explicitly improves writing quality more effectively than traditional grammar instruction.

**Cohesion and Coherence**

Components for creating connected text include:

- Using pronouns to maintain reference
- Employing conjunctions to show relationships
- Repeating key terms for emphasis
- Using substitution and ellipsis appropriately
- Maintaining consistent tense and viewpoint
- Organising ideas logically within paragraphs

These cohesive devices, taught systematically, enable pupils to produce writing that flows rather than remaining as lists of disconnected sentences.

### Composition Components

**Generating and Organising Ideas**

Before writing, writers must:

- Generate ideas through brainstorming, discussion and research
- Select and prioritise content for relevance and interest
- Organise material into coherent structures
- Plan openings that engage readers
- Consider how to develop and conclude pieces

These planning and organising components are often under-taught, with pupils moving too quickly to drafting without adequate preparation.

**Adapting for Audience and Purpose**

Effective writers adjust their writing considering:

- Who will read the text (audience)
- Why the text is being written (purpose)
- What form the text should take (genre)
- What tone is appropriate to the context
- What knowledge readers can be assumed to have

These rhetorical components distinguish skilled writers from those who produce generic texts regardless of context.

### Writing Composites

**Writing Composite: Extended Narrative**

Writing a complete story requires integration of:

- Character creation and development
- Setting establishment and atmosphere-building
- Plot structure and pacing
- Dialogue that advances character and plot
- Narrative voice and point of view
- Thematic resonance and resolution
- Accurate transcription and appropriate presentation

Each element is a component; their orchestration into coherent, engaging narrative is the composite achievement.

**Writing Composite: Critical Essay**

Academic writing about literature demands:

- Clear thesis statement and argument
- Textual evidence integrated effectively
- Analysis rather than summary
- Awareness of critical perspectives
- Formal register and academic conventions
- Coherent paragraph structure with topic sentences
- Precise vocabulary and grammatical control

This composite, essential for academic success, requires years of component development before pupils can perform it independently.

## Components in Literature Study

### Textual Analysis Components

**Identifying and Naming Features**

The foundation of literary study involves recognising:

- Narrative structure and perspective
- Poetic form and metre
- Dramatic conventions and stagecraft
- Literary and rhetorical devices
- Register, dialect and idiolect
- Symbolism and imagery

Naming features accurately is a component prerequisite to analysing their effects.

**Explaining Effects**

Moving beyond identification to interpretation:

- How specific language choices create meaning
- How structural decisions shape reader experience
- How form and content interact
- How context influences interpretation
- How texts position readers ideologically

These analytical components develop through modelling, scaffolding and practice.

### Contextual Understanding Components

**Historical Context**

Understanding how texts emerge from their times:

- Historical events referenced or shaping texts
- Social structures and power relations
- Literary movements and their characteristics
- Changing language and conventions over time

**Cultural Context**

Recognising cultural dimensions:

- Religious and philosophical influences
- Gender and sexuality constructions
- Class and economic factors
- Race, empire and postcolonial perspectives

These contextual components enrich interpretation but must be taught as integrated with textual analysis rather than as separate "background" information.

### Literature Composites

**Literature Composite: Comparative Analysis**

Comparing texts requires:

- Independent analysis of each text
- Identification of meaningful points of comparison
- Theorisation of relationships (similarity, difference, influence)
- Sustained argument across multiple texts
- Integration of context with textual analysis

This composite, central to advanced literary study, demands secure component mastery across reading, writing and contextual knowledge.

## Sequencing from Foundational to Complex

### Principles of Progression

**Cumulative Curriculum Design**

Effective English curricula follow principles of:

- **Spacing**: Returning to components at intervals with increasing complexity
- **Interleaving**: Mixing different component types rather than blocking by topic
- **Retrieval**: Regular opportunities to recall and apply prior learning
- **Elaboration**: Connecting new learning to existing knowledge

These principles, derived from cognitive science research, ensure that components become durable and transferable.

**Spiralling Content**

English curricula should spiral, returning to the same components at higher levels:

- **Year 7**: Simple sentence structures; identifying similes and metaphors; literal comprehension
- **Year 9**: Complex sentence variety; analysing figurative language; inferential comprehension
- **Year 11**: Rhetorical sentence construction; evaluating authorial craft; critical perspectives

Each return to a component builds on prior learning while introducing greater complexity.

### Building Component Chains

**Example: From Sentence to Essay**

A progression for analytical writing might chain components:

1. **Isolated sentences**: Write grammatically accurate simple sentences about a text
2. **Sentence combining**: Join related ideas using coordinating and subordinating conjunctions
3. **PEE paragraphs**: Construct paragraphs with point, evidence, explanation structure
4. **Developed paragraphs**: Add context and analysis to basic PEE structure
5. **Linked paragraphs**: Connect paragraphs using transitional devices and argumentative logic
6. **Full essays**: Compose introductions, developed body paragraphs and conclusions
7. **Sophisticated essays**: Integrate critical perspectives, contextual understanding and independent interpretation

Each step represents a composite built from prior components, with explicit teaching ensuring pupils recognise how new skills build on prior learning.

**Example: From Decoding to Analysis**

A reading progression might sequence:

1. **Phonemic awareness**: Hear and manipulate sounds in words
2. **Phonics**: Decode words using grapheme-phoneme knowledge
3. **Fluency**: Read with accuracy, speed and expression
4. **Literal comprehension**: Recall explicit information
5. **Inference**: Draw conclusions from textual evidence
6. **Analysis**: Examine how writers create effects
7. **Evaluation**: Assess texts critically and comparatively

This sequence ensures that comprehension difficulties reflect lack of appropriate strategies rather than decoding problems.

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Explicit Component Instruction

**Modelling and Demonstration**

Teachers make components visible through:

- Thinking aloud while reading or writing
- Demonstrating processes on board or screen
- Using visualisers to show live writing
- Annotating texts collectively

**Guided Practice**

Pupils develop components through:

- Scaffolded activities with decreasing support
- Collaborative work before independent application
- Deliberate practice with feedback
- Spaced retrieval practice

**Independent Application**

Components consolidate when pupils:

- Apply skills in varied contexts
- Integrate multiple components in authentic tasks
- Self-monitor and self-correct
- Transfer learning to new situations

### Assessing Components and Composites

**Diagnostic Assessment**

Identify which components pupils have mastered:

- Phonics screening checks
- Vocabulary and grammar tests
- Standardised reading assessments
- Writing samples analysed for specific components

Diagnostic assessment prevents assumptions about prior learning and enables targeted intervention.

**Formative Assessment**

Monitor component development during instruction:

- Exit tickets checking specific components
- Quizzing component knowledge
- Observation of component application
- Feedback focused on component improvement

**Summative Assessment**

Evaluate composite performance:

- Extended writing in varied genres
- Reading comprehension assessments
- Literary analysis tasks
- Spoken language presentations

Summative assessment should reflect authentic composites while providing information about component strengths and weaknesses.

### Intervention and Adaptation

**Addressing Component Deficits**

When pupils struggle with composites:

- Diagnose which components are insecure
- Provide targeted component instruction
- Practise components before reintegrating into composites
- Monitor transfer of improved components

**Stretching Component Mastery**

For pupils who master components quickly:

- Introduce more complex contexts for component application
- Teach advanced components earlier
- Develop independent component extension
- Provide enrichment through sophisticated composites

## Applications Across the Curriculum

### Cross-Curricular Literacy

English components underpin learning across subjects:

- **History**: Analysing sources, constructing arguments, writing essays
- **Science**: Reading technical texts, writing reports, explaining processes
- **Mathematics**: Reading word problems, explaining reasoning, presenting solutions
- **Geography**: Interpreting diagrams, writing descriptions, evaluating evidence

Explicit teaching of reading, writing and oracy components benefits all subjects, making cross-curricular collaboration essential.

### Vocabulary as a Bridging Component

Vocabulary knowledge exemplifies how English components
