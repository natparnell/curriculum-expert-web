# Debra Myhill: Contextualised Grammar Teaching and Writing Pedagogy

## Biography and Academic Position

Debra Myhill is Professor Emerita of Education at the University of Exeter, where she served as Director of the Centre for Research in Writing. She is one of the United Kingdom's foremost authorities on the teaching of writing, with particular expertise in grammar instruction, linguistic knowledge for teachers, and the relationship between language awareness and writing development. Her research has significantly influenced national policy discussions and classroom practice in England and internationally.

Myhill's academic career has been characterised by a sustained commitment to evidence-informed pedagogy. She has published extensively in peer-reviewed journals including *Reading and Writing*, *Educational Review*, *Language and Education*, and *Literacy*. Her work bridges the often-contentious divide between linguistic research and classroom practice, offering teachers practical frameworks grounded in rigorous empirical study. She has been cited over 9,000 times according to Google Scholar, reflecting her substantial influence on the field of writing education.

Beyond her research publications, Myhill has been actively involved in teacher education and professional development. She has supervised numerous doctoral students and led large-scale research projects funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF). Her approach consistently emphasises the professional agency of teachers, arguing that effective grammar instruction requires teachers who are confident in their own linguistic knowledge and capable of making informed pedagogical decisions.

## The Grammar for Writing Project: A Randomised Controlled Trial

### Project Overview and Methodology

The Grammar for Writing project represents Myhill's most significant contribution to the evidence base on grammar teaching. Conducted between 2010 and 2012, this large-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigated whether contextualised grammar teaching—grammar instruction embedded within the teaching of writing—would improve student outcomes in writing quality and metalinguistic understanding.

The study involved 744 students aged 10–11 (Year 6) from 31 primary schools across the southwest of England. Schools were randomly assigned to either a treatment group receiving the Grammar for Writing intervention or a control group continuing with their usual practice. The intervention comprised detailed teaching materials and professional development for teachers, designed to embed grammar instruction within meaningful writing contexts rather than teaching it as a separate, decontextualised component.

Myhill collaborated with Dr Susan Jones and Professor Trevor Bailey on this ESRC-funded project. The research design was notable for its methodological rigour: randomised allocation, blind assessment of writing outcomes, and the use of both proximal measures (writing tasks similar to those practised) and distal measures (transfer tasks assessing generalisation). The study also included detailed classroom observation and interview data to understand implementation fidelity and teacher perspectives.

### Key Findings

The Grammar for Writing study produced several important findings that have reshaped understanding of how grammar can be taught effectively:

**Positive Effects on Writing Quality**: Students in the intervention group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in writing quality compared to the control group. The effect sizes were modest but educationally meaningful, particularly given the relatively short duration of the intervention (approximately 10–12 weeks). Importantly, improvements were observed on both practised writing tasks and transfer tasks, suggesting that students were developing transferable understanding rather than merely learning to perform specific writing formats.

**Development of Metalinguistic Understanding**: The study found that students receiving contextualised grammar instruction developed stronger metalinguistic awareness—the ability to talk about language choices and their effects. This finding was significant because it challenged claims that grammar instruction necessarily produces only inert, declarative knowledge. Instead, when taught contextually, grammar knowledge appeared to become usable tool knowledge that students could deploy in their own writing.

**Differential Effects by Prior Attainment**: A notable finding was that the intervention appeared particularly effective for students with lower prior attainment in writing. This pattern suggested that explicit attention to grammar within writing instruction may help to reduce attainment gaps, potentially by making the tacit knowledge of skilled writers more visible and accessible to struggling writers.

**No Evidence of Harm**: Unlike some previous studies that found negative effects of decontextualised grammar teaching on writing motivation and quality, the Grammar for Writing intervention produced no evidence of harmful effects. Students in intervention classrooms remained engaged with writing tasks, and teachers reported that the approach felt pedagogically coherent with their broader writing instruction.

### Theoretical Framework

Myhill's work is grounded in a theoretical framework she terms "grammar as choice"—the understanding that grammar is not merely a set of rules to be followed or errors to be avoided, but a meaning-making resource that writers deploy strategically to achieve their communicative purposes. This framework draws on systemic functional linguistics, particularly the work of Michael Halliday, but translates these theoretical insights into classroom-accessible pedagogy.

Three principles underpin the Grammar for Writing approach:

**Writing as Communicative Act**: The principal pedagogic focus must remain on writing as communication. Attention to grammar is always subordinate to, and in service of, the writer's rhetorical purposes. Grammar is not taught for its own sake but as a resource for crafting meaning.

**Linguistic Choice and Authorial Agency**: Writers should be encouraged to see linguistic choices as deliberate decisions that shape how readers receive their texts. This perspective positions grammar not as constraint but as creative resource—tools that expand rather than limit what writers can achieve.

**Contextualised, Embedded Instruction**: Grammar is most effectively taught within the context of authentic writing, using students' own developing texts and professional published writing as the primary materials for analysis. This contrasts sharply with approaches that teach grammar through artificial exercises disconnected from meaningful composition.

## Contextualised Grammar Teaching: Core Principles

### From Decontextualised to Embedded Instruction

Myhill's research explicitly critiques approaches to grammar teaching that treat language as an isolated system to be mastered before it can be applied. Such decontextualised approaches—grammar worksheets, sentence-level exercises divorced from composition, error-focused correction—have been shown in multiple meta-analyses to produce limited or negative effects on writing development.

Contextualised grammar teaching, by contrast, embeds linguistic instruction within the writing process itself. When a student is crafting a persuasive text, for example, the teacher might draw attention to how modal verbs ("should," "must," "could") create different degrees of obligation or how adverbial phrases of manner can vividly convey action. The grammar is taught because it serves the writing purpose at hand, and students have immediate opportunity to apply their developing understanding within meaningful composition.

This approach requires a fundamental shift in how grammar is conceptualised within the curriculum. Rather than viewing grammar as prerequisite knowledge that must be mastered before good writing is possible, contextualised teaching treats grammatical understanding as developing alongside and in interaction with compositional proficiency. The two develop reciprocally: attention to language improves writing, and the challenges of writing create productive contexts for grammatical learning.

### Dialogic Pedagogy and Metalinguistic Talk

A distinctive feature of Myhill's approach is its emphasis on classroom talk about language. She advocates for "playful explicitness with grammar"—classroom discussions that are intellectually serious about linguistic choices but exploratory and dialogic in character. Students are encouraged to experiment with language, to consider alternatives, and to discuss how different choices produce different effects on readers.

This dialogic pedagogy serves multiple purposes. It makes thinking about language visible and shared, allowing students to learn from each other's observations. It positions grammar as open to discussion and interpretation rather than fixed and arbitrary. And it develops students' metalanguage—the vocabulary for talking about language—without making this the primary objective.

Myhill and her colleagues have articulated specific strategies for fostering productive metalinguistic talk:

**Noticing and Discussion**: Teachers use authentic texts (both published literature and students' own writing) as objects for linguistic analysis. Rather than asking "What is the subordinate clause?" teachers might ask "How does the writer stretch out this moment? What language choices create this effect?"

**Alternative Constructions**: Students are encouraged to rephrase sentences, considering how different grammatical choices alter meaning, tone, or emphasis. This develops flexibility in language use and demonstrates grammar as resource rather than rule.

**Writerly Decision-Making**: Discussion consistently connects linguistic choices to authorial purpose. Why might a writer choose passive voice here? What does the cumulative sentence structure contribute to the description? This maintains focus on writing as craft.

## Linguistic Knowledge for Teachers

### The Teacher as Linguistic Expert

A recurring theme in Myhill's work is the necessity of teachers possessing robust linguistic knowledge. She argues persuasively that teachers cannot teach grammar effectively if they lack confidence in their own understanding of how language works. This observation has significant implications for teacher education and continuing professional development.

Myhill distinguishes between declarative knowledge (knowing grammatical terminology and definitions) and procedural knowledge (understanding how grammatical choices function in actual writing). Both are necessary, but the latter is often neglected in teacher preparation. A teacher may know what a subordinate clause is without understanding how subordination creates syntactic complexity, manages information flow, or establishes relationships between ideas.

Her research has documented the variable linguistic knowledge among English teachers, finding that many feel underprepared to teach grammar despite its renewed prominence in the National Curriculum. This gap between policy requirements and teacher capability represents a significant challenge for implementation of grammar-focused curricula.

### Developing Teacher Knowledge

Myhill advocates for professional development approaches that:

**Start with Teachers' Own Writing**: Teachers who engage with grammar through their own composition develop more nuanced understanding than those who encounter it only as abstract system. Writing together, sharing and discussing choices, builds both knowledge and confidence.

**Focus on Function as well as Form**: Professional learning should emphasise what grammatical choices do in texts, not merely how to identify them. This functional orientation makes grammar relevant to teaching practice.

**Model Contextualised Pedagogy**: Teachers need to experience contextualised grammar teaching as learners before they can enact it effectively in their classrooms. Professional development should demonstrate, not merely describe, the approach.

**Build Communities of Practice**: Sustained professional learning, where teachers collaborate over time to develop their practice, produces better outcomes than one-off training events. Myhill's research projects have consistently included substantial professional development components to support implementation.

## Playful Explicitness: A Pedagogy for Writing

Myhill, together with colleagues Annabel Watson and Helen Lines, has articulated a specific pedagogical approach they term "playful explicitness with grammar." This concept captures the delicate balance required in effective grammar teaching: explicit enough to build usable knowledge, playful enough to maintain engagement and creativity.

"Explicitness" refers to the deliberate, planned attention to grammar within writing instruction. It rejects the notion that grammar is best learned implicitly through extensive reading and writing alone. While such implicit learning certainly occurs, Myhill's research demonstrates that explicit instruction can accelerate development and make linguistic knowledge more available for deliberate deployment.

"Playfulness" refers to the exploratory, experimental spirit that characterises effective grammar pedagogy. Students should feel free to try linguistic possibilities, to make bold choices, to break rules for effect. Grammar is presented not as constraint but as toolkit—resources that expand creative possibilities rather than limiting them.

This playful explicitness manifests in classroom activities such as:

**Sentence Crafting Games**: Activities where students manipulate sentence structures to achieve different effects, competing to create the most vivid description or the most compelling argument.

**Author Imitation**: Close study of how published writers use particular grammatical constructions, followed by deliberate experimentation with these techniques in students' own writing.

**Revision Workshops**: Structured opportunities to revise draft writing with explicit attention to linguistic choices, guided by questions about purpose and effect rather than correctness.

## Key Publications and Research Trajectory

Myhill's scholarly output spans over two decades and includes influential books, journal articles, and research reports. Key publications include:

**"Grammar for Writing? An Investigation of the Effects of Contextualised Grammar Teaching on Students' Writing"** (2013, with Susan Jones and Trevor Bailey, published in *Reading and Writing*): The landmark RCT establishing the efficacy of contextualised grammar instruction.

**"Re-thinking Grammar: The Impact of Embedded Grammar Teaching on Students' Writing and Students' Metalinguistic Understanding"** (2012, with Susan Jones and Annabel Watson, *Research Papers in Education*): Early findings from the Grammar for Writing project documenting effects on both writing quality and metalinguistic awareness.

**"The Role of Grammar in the Writing Curriculum: A Review of the Literature"** (2014, with Annabel Watson, *Written Communication*): A comprehensive synthesis of research on grammar teaching, establishing the evidential basis for contextualised approaches.

**"Grammar Re-imagined: Foregrounding Understanding of Language Choice in Writing"** (2021, with Annabel Watson, Helen Lines, and others, *English in Australia*): Development of the "grammar as choice" framework and its implications for pedagogy.

**"Writing with Grammar in Mind"** (*English Teaching: Practice and Critique*, 2010): An early articulation of Myhill's theoretical framework, establishing the principles that would guide her subsequent empirical work.

Myhill has also contributed to major edited collections including *The SAGE Handbook of Writing Development* (2009, with Roger Beard and others) and *Beyond the Grammar Wars* (2010), edited by Terry Locke. Her work consistently bridges research and practice, offering teachers accessible entry points into complex theoretical and empirical territory.

## Implications for Curriculum and Assessment

### National Curriculum Alignment

Myhill's research has particular relevance for implementation of the English National Curriculum, which since 2014 has included explicit requirements for grammar teaching. Her work provides evidence-informed guidance for how these requirements might be enacted without reverting to the decontextualised, worksheet-based approaches that research has shown to be ineffective.

The National Curriculum's focus on "grammar and punctuation" at Key Stages 1 and 2, and on linguistic analysis at Key Stage 3, creates both opportunity and risk. The opportunity lies in making language a visible object of study, potentially developing students' metalinguistic awareness and control over their own writing. The risk lies in superficial implementation—teaching terminology without developing functional understanding, or treating grammar as separate from the creative and communicative purposes of writing.

Myhill's research suggests that effective implementation requires:

**Sustained Professional Development**: Teachers need support to develop the linguistic knowledge and pedagogical strategies required for contextualised grammar teaching. This cannot be achieved through one-off training.

**Curriculum Coherence**: Grammar should be integrated within writing units of study, not taught as a separate strand. Long-term planning should identify how linguistic knowledge develops progressively across key stages.

**Assessment Alignment**: If assessment focuses primarily on grammatical accuracy (correctness), teachers will naturally emphasise error-avoidance over linguistic craft. Assessment should recognise and reward sophisticated, purposeful language choices.

### Assessment of Writing

Myhill's work has implications for how writing is assessed, particularly in high-stakes contexts such as GCSE and Key Stage 2 SATs. Current assessment frameworks that focus on specific technical features (range of punctuation, subordinate clauses, ambitious vocabulary) risk encouraging formulaic writing that demonstrates technical competence without communicative effectiveness.

An assessment approach more aligned with Myhill's research would:

**Weight Rhetorical Effectiveness**: Technical accuracy matters, but primarily in service of communicative purpose. Assessment criteria should prioritise whether the writing achieves its intended effect on readers.

**Recognise Linguistic Craft**: Sophisticated use of grammar for effect—controlling pace through sentence variation, managing emphasis through syntactic choices, creating voice through distinctive language patterns—should be explicitly valued.

**Reward Risk-Taking**: Writers who experiment with language, attempting ambitious constructions that occasionally misfire, should be recognised for their craft ambition rather than penalised for every error.

## Classroom Applications: Practical Strategies

### The Grammar for Writing Toolkit

Drawing on Myhill's research, teachers can implement contextualised grammar teaching through structured approaches that embed linguistic study within writing instruction. The following strategies reflect the principles of playful explicitness and grammar as choice:

**Micro-Analysis of Exemplar Texts**: Before writing, students analyse brief extracts from published texts focusing on specific linguistic features. The analysis is always functional: not "find the adverbials" but "notice how the writer slows down the action—what language choices create this effect?"

**Generative Activities**: Students generate multiple versions of sentences or paragraphs, experimenting with how different grammatical choices alter meaning. This develops flexibility and demonstrates grammar as resource.

**Craft Lessons**: Short, focused mini-lessons on specific grammatical constructions, taught in the context of the genre being studied. A lesson on cumulative sentences during a descriptive writing unit, for example, with immediate opportunity to apply in students' own drafts.

**Writer's Toolbox**: Developing shared repertoires of grammatical techniques that writers can draw upon, displayed in classrooms and added to throughout the year. Students are encouraged to name the techniques they are using and to explain their rhetorical purposes.

**Revision Conferences**: One-to-one or small-group conferences that focus on linguistic choices in draft writing. The teacher asks exploratory questions: "What effect are you aiming for here? What language choices might help achieve that?"

### Differentiation and Inclusion

Myhill's finding that contextualised grammar teaching particularly benefits lower-attaining writers has implications for differentiation. Rather than simplifying grammar instruction for struggling writers, the research suggests that explicit attention to language choices makes the tacit knowledge of skilled writers more accessible.

Strategies for inclusive grammar teaching include:

**Universal Design**: All students engage with the same rich texts and ambitious linguistic goals. Support is provided through scaffolding and additional rehearsal, not through reduced curriculum expectations.

**Oral Rehearsal**: Opportunities to articulate ideas and experiment with language choices orally before committing to writing. This reduces cognitive load and builds metalinguistic awareness.

**Concrete-Abstract-Concrete Progression**: Moving between examination of concrete examples (specific sentences), abstract generalisation (the grammatical principle), and application to new concrete instances (students' own writing).

**Collaborative Writing**: Pair and group composition activities that make linguistic decision-making visible and shared, allowing students to learn from each other's insights.

## Critiques and Limitations

### Methodological Considerations

While the Grammar for Writing RCT represents methodologically rigorous research, several limitations should be acknowledged. The study was conducted with Year 6 students; effects may differ at other age ranges. The intervention was relatively brief (one term); longer-term implementation might produce different or more sustained effects. The study measured writing outcomes at the end of the intervention; longer-term follow-up would establish whether gains persist.

The study was also conducted prior to the 2014 National Curriculum reforms. The context for grammar teaching has shifted, with increased specification of grammatical content and high-stakes testing
