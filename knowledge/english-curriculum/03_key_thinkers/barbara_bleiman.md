# Barbara Bleiman: Voice of Contemporary English Teaching

## Biography and Professional Background

Barbara Bleiman has worked in education for over 40 years, establishing herself as one of the most influential voices in secondary English teaching in the United Kingdom. Her career spans classroom teaching, curriculum development, educational research, and extensive writing about English pedagogy. Since joining the English and Media Centre (EMC) as an education consultant, she has shaped the thinking of thousands of English teachers through her publications, professional development courses, and thought leadership.

In 2019, Bleiman received the National Association for the Teaching of English (NATE) Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Teaching of English, recognition of her sustained impact on the subject. She is also a Fellow of the English Association, further cementing her status within the academic and educational community. These honours reflect not merely longevity of service but the depth of her influence on how English is conceptualised, taught, and debated in contemporary schools.

Bleiman's work is characterised by a principled, sometimes polemical engagement with the most pressing issues facing English teachers today. She describes her own writing as "informed, principled—sometimes unashamedly polemical" in its defence of particular approaches to the subject. This willingness to take clear positions on contested terrain has made her a significant figure in ongoing debates about curriculum, pedagogy, and the fundamental purposes of English education.

Beyond her educational work, Bleiman is also a writer of fiction, having published two novels—*Off the Voortrekker Road* and *Accidents of Love*—as well as a collection of short stories, *Kremlinology of Kisses*. This dual identity as both educator and creative writer informs her understanding of literature and language, grounding her pedagogical insights in lived creative practice.

## The English and Media Centre (EMC)

### Origins and Mission

The English and Media Centre (EMC) is a development centre for English and Media teaching in secondary schools, based in London. Under Bleiman's influence and that of her colleagues, the EMC has become one of the most respected providers of curriculum resources, professional development, and intellectual leadership for English teachers in the United Kingdom.

The EMC's approach is distinctive in its commitment to theoretically informed, practically grounded support for teachers. Rather than offering decontextualised activities or generic strategies, EMC resources typically embed pedagogical principles within rich, engaging materials that model the kind of classroom practice they advocate. This alignment of means and ends—teaching through demonstration rather than prescription—reflects Bleiman's educational philosophy.

### Key Publications and Resources

Bleiman has written or co-written numerous award-winning resources for the EMC, spanning poetry, novels, Shakespeare, and language study. Among her most significant publications are:

- **Doing Close Reading**: A resource developing students' skills in detailed textual analysis
- **Studying The Handmaid's Tale**: Curriculum materials supporting the study of Atwood's novel
- **Sight/Unseen Poetry**: Approaches to teaching both set poems and unseen poetry analysis
- **KS3 Poetry Plus**: Resources for Key Stage 3 poetry teaching
- **Curriculum Conversations: Going on an Odyssey**: Materials supporting the teaching of Homer's epic

These resources share common characteristics: they assume intelligent, engaged students; they treat literary texts as complex, multi-layered works deserving serious attention; and they build student knowledge and skills through active, exploratory engagement rather than passive reception.

### emagazine

Bleiman serves as co-editor of *emagazine*, the EMC's quarterly print subscription magazine for A Level students. This publication extends the EMC's reach beyond teachers to students themselves, providing accessible yet intellectually demanding material that supports advanced level study of English. The magazine exemplifies Bleiman's commitment to treating students as capable of serious intellectual engagement with literary and linguistic questions.

## Core Pedagogical Principles

### The Centrality of Talk: "It's Good to Talk"

One of Bleiman's most significant contributions to English pedagogy is her leadership of the EMC's "It's Good to Talk" project, a sustained investigation into group work and classroom discussion. This project emerged from observations that group work was being practised less frequently and with less confidence than previously, alongside a sense that available guidance focused on organisational structures rather than the substantive questions of what makes group work educationally valuable.

The project involved filming Year 7 students engaged in group work activities, creating a substantial archive of video material that has been used for professional development and research. From this work, Bleiman and her colleagues identified ten key themes for investigation:

1. What kinds of things group work is good for (and what it is not good for)
2. The role of the teacher in setting up, intervening in, and framing group work
3. Time allocation and pacing of activities
4. The role of report-backs and whole-class feedback
5. The appropriate level of challenge in group work
6. What kinds of tasks work best
7. How to respond when students do not seem to be making visible progress
8. The value of creative work in group work on texts
9. Insights group work offers into student learning
10. The relationship between grouping structures (setting versus mixed ability) and group work effectiveness

A key finding from the project was that students value challenge in group work. When asked about their experiences, students repeatedly used the word "think"—they valued opportunities to "think hard," "think out of the box," and "think for themselves." This insight challenges deficit models that assume students need highly scaffolded, simplified tasks, suggesting instead that intellectual challenge, properly structured, is inherently motivating.

Bleiman argues that group work is "not just a 'take it or leave it' part of our classroom repertoire but an absolutely vital element, without which students are likely to be seriously disadvantaged in their learning." This strong claim positions talk and collaborative thinking as essential to English education, not merely optional enrichment activities.

### Cultural Conversations versus Cultural Capital

Bleiman has developed the concept of "cultural conversations" as an alternative to the increasingly influential notion of "cultural capital." While acknowledging the importance of students encountering significant cultural works, she critiques approaches that treat cultural knowledge as a fixed asset to be accumulated and displayed.

The "cultural conversations" model emphasises:
- Active engagement with cultural texts rather than passive accumulation of facts about them
- Dialogue and exchange rather than transmission
- The transformative potential of literature rather than its status as cultural currency
- Multiple perspectives and interpretations rather than authoritative readings

This framework has significant implications for curriculum design, suggesting that breadth of encounter matters less than depth of engagement, and that the quality of students' interaction with texts matters more than the prestige of the texts themselves.

### Grammar Teaching: Embedded and Contextualised

Bleiman has written extensively on grammar teaching, articulating a position that affirms the importance of grammar while critiquing prevalent approaches. In her influential blog post "A Great Big Grammar Hammer—But What Nut Is It Cracking?" she begins with an unequivocal statement: "I love grammar. And I love the teaching of grammar." This starting point is essential for understanding her critique, which comes from within a commitment to grammar education rather than opposition to it.

Her key arguments include:

**Age and Stage Appropriateness**: Grammar teaching should match the developmental stage of students. Bleiman questions whether working through the entire system of sentence grammar is valuable for all students at KS2 and KS3, suggesting that introductory, conceptual engagement may be more productive than comprehensive coverage at early stages.

**Complexity and Contested Nature**: Grammar is complicated and contested; linguists use different terms for the same phenomena. This complexity should inform pedagogical choices about what terminology is essential and when.

**Embedded in Context**: Grammar should be taught in the context of whole texts—texts written, read, and spoken by students. This contextualised approach treats grammar as a meaning-making resource rather than an abstract system.

**Evidence Base**: Bleiman draws on Debra Myhill's research at Exeter University, which suggests that noticing, thinking, questioning, and talking about grammar in texts can be helpful, but that benefits come from conceptual understanding rather than terminology knowledge. Just knowing terms has limited benefit and may be counter-productive.

**Spoken and Written Language**: The study of grammar must encompass spoken as well as written language, and non-standard as well as standard forms. Without this breadth, grammar teaching risks codifying linguistic prejudice and hierarchies.

**Big Picture Understanding**: Bleiman advocates for "big, meaty units" on spoken and written English, varieties of English, and the history of the language, rather than regular sessions on sentence-level features. This conceptual grounding provides essential context for any detailed study of grammar.

## Views on KS4 and KS5 Literature Teaching

### The Nature of Literature Study

Bleiman's work on A Level and GCSE literature resources reveals a consistent vision of what advanced literary study should involve. She resists reduction of literature study to either narrow technical analysis or purely personal response, advocating instead for approaches that combine:

- Close attention to textual detail
- Understanding of historical and cultural contexts
- Recognition of literary form and genre
- Personal engagement and interpretation
- Awareness of how texts generate multiple readings

This integrative vision is reflected in EMC resources that treat literary texts as complex works that reward careful, sustained attention while remaining open to varied interpretation.

### Writing about Literature

Bleiman has led professional development on "What is Good Writing for A Level Literature and How to Develop It." Her approach to writing development emphasises:

- The relationship between exploratory talk and exploratory writing
- The importance of students finding their own critical voice
- Development of analytical precision without sacrificing personal engagement
- The role of drafting and redrafting in developing sophisticated argumentation

This focus on writing as developmental and recursive challenges models that treat essay writing as a simple demonstration of pre-existing knowledge.

### Challenging Prescription

Throughout her work, Bleiman has been a vocal critic of increasing prescription in English education. Her 2019 Harold Rosen Address to the NATE Conference, cited by reviewers as "rightly insistent in its demands to broaden an increasingly prescriptive view of English as a subject," articulated concerns about:

- The narrowing effects of high-stakes assessment
- Curriculum specification that leaves insufficient room for teacher professional judgment
- Approaches that privilege memorisation and reproduction over exploration and interpretation
- The marginalisation of creative writing, media studies, and spoken language within the subject

These concerns inform all her work, giving it a consistent critical edge and a clear sense of what English education might be at its best.

### Literature and Society

Bleiman's educational writing engages seriously with the social purposes of literature teaching. She argues for literature's capacity to:

- Develop empathy and understanding across difference
- Provide access to diverse experiences and perspectives
- Equip students to participate in cultural conversations
- Support critical thinking about language, power, and representation

These purposes are not add-ons to literary study but integral to it—part of what makes literature worth teaching and studying.

## Key Publications

### What Matters in English Teaching (2020)

Bleiman's book *What Matters in English Teaching: Collected Blogs and Other Writings* represents a sustained articulation of her educational philosophy. Published by the EMC in March 2020, the book gathers and expands upon her influential blog posts, addressing what she considers the most important issues in English teaching today.

The book is organised around key themes including:
- Definitions and versions of English as a subject
- Curriculum content and design
- Pedagogical approaches
- Assessment and its effects
- The politics and policy context of English education

Reviewers have emphasised the book's accessibility and practical relevance. One described it as essential reading "for anyone training to teach English," noting that Bleiman "covers it all"—the history, philosophies, debates, and practicalities of the subject. Another highlighted its value for experienced teachers as well as novices, providing "an informed, principled... account of the most important issues in English teaching now."

The book's polemical edge is part of its purpose. Bleiman uses the platform to argue for particular visions of the subject against alternatives she considers impoverished or misguided. This willingness to take positions—to say clearly what she thinks matters and why—distinguishes her work from more neutral, descriptive accounts.

### EMC Coursebooks and Resources

Beyond her authored book, Bleiman has contributed to numerous EMC publications that serve as curriculum resources for teachers. These include:

- **The Poetry Pack**: A comprehensive resource for teaching poetry
- **Language and Literature coursebooks**: Supporting integrated study at advanced level
- **Publications on specific set texts**: Including *The Handmaid's Tale* and Shakespeare plays
- **Professional development materials**: Supporting teacher learning and reflection

These resources are characterised by theoretical coherence, practical utility, and intellectual ambition—qualities that reflect Bleiman's influence on the EMC's output.

### Articles and Chapters

Bleiman's writing appears in edited collections and journals, extending her reach beyond EMC publications. Notable contributions include:

- "Advanced Level English" in *Learning to Teach English in the Secondary School* (Routledge, 4th Edition, 2014)
- "The Changing Picture of School English" in *English: Shared Futures* (Boydell and Brewer, 2018)
- "Post-16 Literature" in *A Practical Guide to Teaching English in the Secondary School* (Routledge, 2nd Edition, 2021)

These chapters provide accessible entry points to her thinking for different audiences, from trainee teachers to academic researchers.

## Influence and Legacy

### Impact on Professional Practice

Bleiman's influence on English teaching operates through multiple channels. Her direct work with teachers through EMC professional development courses has reached thousands of practitioners. Her publications—both free blog posts and purchased resources—extend this reach further. Perhaps most significantly, her ideas circulate through the practices of teachers who have absorbed her approaches and apply them in their own classrooms.

The "It's Good to Talk" project exemplifies this multi-layered impact. What began as a research project has generated video materials, blog posts, conference presentations, and professional development courses, each extending the reach of the original work. Teachers who have never met Bleiman may nevertheless be applying insights derived from her research.

### Contribution to Debate

Bleiman has been a significant voice in public debates about English education. Her blog posts are widely shared and discussed, and she has spoken at numerous conferences and events. In an era of rapid policy change and frequent curriculum reform, her sustained, principled articulation of a vision for the subject provides a point of orientation for teachers navigating shifting terrain.

Her engagement with critics—such as her public exchanges with David Didau on group work and grammar—exemplifies a willingness to engage in serious intellectual debate about educational questions. These exchanges, conducted with respect even when disagreement is sharp, model the kind of discourse she values.

### Recognition and Awards

The NATE Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Teaching of English (2019) represents formal recognition of Bleiman's impact. Fellowships of the English Association and other honours similarly acknowledge her standing within the educational and academic community.

These awards are significant not merely as personal recognition but as validation of the approaches to English teaching she advocates. When organisations honour Bleiman, they honour particular values: intellectual seriousness, pedagogical principle, and commitment to the transformative potential of English education.

## Classroom Applications

### Developing Classroom Talk

Bleiman's work on group work and discussion offers practical guidance for teachers seeking to develop their practice:

**Task Design**: Group work is most effective when tasks are genuinely challenging and require collaborative thinking. Simple information-sharing activities may not justify the organisational complexity of group work.

**Teacher Role**: Teachers should be active in setting up group work, establishing purposes, and intervening when necessary. This is not a "hands-off" pedagogy but one requiring skilled facilitation.

**Time and Pacing**: Adequate time must be allocated for group work to achieve its purposes. Rushed discussions are unlikely to generate the depth of thinking that justifies the approach.

**Report-Backs**: Whole-class sharing following group work is essential for consolidating learning and allowing ideas to circulate more broadly.

### Teaching Grammar

Bleiman's approach to grammar teaching suggests several practical principles:

**Context First**: Grammar should be taught through engagement with whole texts rather than isolated examples.

**Noticing and Wondering**: Encourage students to notice interesting linguistic features and speculate about their effects before introducing terminology.

**Conceptual Understanding**: Prioritise understanding of grammatical concepts over memorisation of terms.

**Spoken and Written**: Include spoken language in grammar study, attending to the differences between speech and writing.

**Big Picture Units**: Consider organising grammar teaching around substantial units on language varieties, spoken versus written English, and the history of the language, rather than atomised lessons on sentence features.

### Literature Teaching

For teachers of literature at KS4 and KS5, Bleiman's work suggests:

**Intellectual Challenge**: Students benefit from genuine intellectual challenge. Simplified or highly scaffolded approaches may underestimate what students can achieve.

**Integrative Approaches**: Combine close reading, contextual knowledge, genre awareness, and personal response rather than treating these as separate elements.

**Writing Development**: Support students to develop as writers about literature through processes of drafting, feedback, and revision.

**Critical Voice**: Encourage students to develop their own critical voice rather than simply reproducing authorised interpretations.

## Critical Reception and Debates

### Support and Endorsement

Bleiman's work has received significant endorsement from teachers and teacher educators. Reviews of *What Matters in English Teaching* emphasise its practical relevance and intellectual ambition. The NATE Award and other honours reflect professional respect for her contributions.

Teachers frequently cite Bleiman's blog posts as influential on their thinking and practice. The accessibility of this format—free, timely, and conversational—has enabled her to reach practitioners who might not engage with more formal publications.

### Points of Contention

Bleiman's willingness to take positions means her work has also generated disagreement. Her exchanges with David Didau on group work and grammar illustrate areas of debate:

- The relative effectiveness of group work versus whole-class instruction
- The appropriate balance between explicit grammar instruction and embedded approaches
- The relationship between knowledge acquisition and exploratory learning
- The proper purposes and content of English as a subject

These debates are productive insofar as they clarify positions and force advocates to articulate and defend their views. Bleiman's participation in such exchanges demonstrates her commitment to treating English education as a field requiring serious intellectual engagement.

### Contemporary Relevance

Bleiman's work remains highly relevant to contemporary English teaching. Her critiques of excessive prescription speak directly to teachers
