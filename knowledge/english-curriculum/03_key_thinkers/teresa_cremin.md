## Core Research Focus and Scholarly Contributions

Cremin's socio-cultural research centres on three interconnected domains that have reshaped understanding of literacy education in the primary phase and beyond.

### Teachers' Literate Identities and Practices

At the heart of Cremin's research is a sustained interest in how teachers position themselves as readers and writers, and how these identity positions impact their pedagogical practices. Her work reveals that teachers' personal relationships with literacy profoundly shape the literacy environments they create for children. Teachers who identify as readers and writers bring different knowledge, enthusiasm, and practices to their teaching than those who do not.

This focus on identity represents a significant shift from earlier approaches to teacher professional development that focused primarily on technique and strategy. Cremin's work argues that developing teachers as readers and writers is not merely a desirable extra but fundamental to effective literacy pedagogy.

### Pedagogies of Volitional Reading and Writing

Cremin has developed comprehensive frameworks for understanding and implementing pedagogies that foster children's desire to read and write beyond curricular requirements. This work challenges instrumental approaches that view reading and writing merely as skills to be mastered, instead positioning them as practices that can bring pleasure, meaning, and agency to children's lives.

Her research demonstrates that when children read and write volitionally—by choice, for their own purposes—they develop not only technical proficiency but also positive identities as readers and writers that can sustain lifelong engagement with literacy.

### Creative Teaching and Learning

Throughout her career, Cremin has explored the role of creativity in education, from the early years through to Higher Education. Her work on 'possibility thinking' with colleague Anna Craft examined the creative engagement patterns through which children and adults pose questions, explore ideas, and imagine alternatives. This research has informed her approach to literacy, which consistently emphasises the aesthetic, imaginative, and playful dimensions of reading and writing.

## The Teachers as Readers (TaRs) Research Programme

The Teachers as Readers (TaRs) study represents one of Cremin's most influential contributions to literacy education. This seminal research, conducted with colleagues Marilyn Mottram, Fiona Collins, Sacha Powell, and Kimberly Safford, has fundamentally shaped understanding of how teachers' own reading practices influence their ability to foster reading for pleasure in the classroom.

### Research Design and Methodology

The TaRs study was undertaken across 27 schools with 43 teachers in five areas of England over the course of one academic year (Cremin et al., 2014). The research employed a mixed-methods approach combining ethnographic observation in classrooms, teacher interviews and reflective journals, surveys of children's reading attitudes and behaviours, analysis of teacher knowledge of children's literature, and documentation of pedagogical practices.

This multi-site design enabled the research team to identify patterns across diverse educational contexts while capturing the nuanced, context-specific nature of teacher practice. The study was funded by the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation and represented one of the most comprehensive investigations of reading for pleasure in primary schools conducted in the UK.

### The Concept of the 'Reading Teacher'

Central to the TaRs research is the concept of the "Reading Teacher"—a teacher who reads and a reader who teaches (Commeyras et al., 2004; Cremin et al., 2009). This dual identity is not merely about reading frequency or volume; rather, it encompasses three interconnected dimensions:

**Knowledge of Children's Literature and Texts**
Reading Teachers possess broad, up-to-date knowledge of children's books, authors, and genres. They read widely across age ranges and text types, enabling them to make informed recommendations to children with diverse interests and reading levels. This knowledge includes awareness of contemporary publications, classic texts, diverse voices, and different formats including graphic novels, poetry, and non-fiction.

**Engagement as Readers**
Reading Teachers engage enthusiastically and reciprocally with texts. They share their reading lives with children, discussing books they are currently reading, their reading histories, and their preferences. This modelling is authentic rather than performative—children can sense when teachers are genuinely engaged readers rather than simply performing reading for educational purposes.

**Pedagogical Expertise**
Reading Teachers possess a repertoire of strategies for fostering reading for pleasure, including booktalk, reading aloud, creating reading environments, and building reading communities. They understand that fostering reading for pleasure requires specific pedagogical approaches that differ from those used in teaching reading as a skill.

### Key Findings from the TaRs Research

The TaRs study produced several findings that have reshaped approaches to reading for pleasure in primary schools:

**The Knowledge Gap**
Many teachers entering the profession had limited knowledge of contemporary children's literature. Their own childhood reading often dominated their book recommendations, leading to outdated or narrow selections. This gap was particularly pronounced among teachers who did not identify as readers in their personal lives. The research revealed that teachers often recommended books they had read as children, resulting in recommendations that were decades out of date.

**Identity and Practice**
Teachers who identified as readers in their personal lives were more likely to create classroom environments that supported reading for pleasure. Their literate identities shaped the reading identities they made available to children. Conversely, teachers who positioned themselves as non-readers struggled to model engagement with reading and often relied on instrumental approaches that failed to foster genuine pleasure in reading.

**The Social Dimension of Reading**
The research revealed that reading for pleasure flourishes in social contexts. Reading is not merely a solitary activity but one enriched by conversation, recommendation, and shared experience. Classrooms where reading was talked about informally and enthusiastically showed higher levels of reading engagement.

**Professional Development Matters**
When teachers engaged in sustained professional development focused on reading for pleasure—including reading groups, author visits, and book discussions—their knowledge, confidence, and practices developed significantly. The TaRs project itself served as a form of professional development, and teachers who participated showed marked growth in their knowledge of children's literature and their confidence in fostering reading for pleasure.

### The 'Reading Teachers = Reading Pupils' Equation

A central insight from the TaRs research is that teachers who read themselves are better positioned to nurture reading for pleasure in their pupils. This is not a deterministic relationship—reading teachers may not automatically produce reading pupils—but the correlation is strong. Teachers who read widely and regularly, engage with children's literature, share their reading lives authentically, and create time and space for reading in the curriculum are significantly more likely to develop classrooms where children choose to read, talk about books, and develop positive reader identities.

This insight has profound implications for teacher education and professional development. It suggests that developing teachers as readers should be a central goal of initial teacher education and continuing professional development, rather than an optional extra.

## Reading for Pleasure Pedagogy

Building on the TaRs research, Cremin has developed a comprehensive framework for reading for pleasure pedagogy. This approach positions reading for pleasure not as an add-on or reward activity, but as a fundamental educational entitlement with cognitive, social, and emotional benefits.

### The Core Elements of Reading for Pleasure Pedagogy

Cremin identifies several interconnected elements that together constitute an effective reading for pleasure pedagogy:

**Reading Aloud**
Regular, skilled reading aloud by teachers introduces children to texts they might not yet access independently, models fluent reading, creates shared experiences, and builds community. Reading aloud should include fiction, non-fiction, and poetry across a range of genres and voices. It should be a daily practice, not an occasional treat, and should continue well beyond the early years into Key Stage 2 and beyond.

**Independent Reading Time**
Children need protected time for independent reading—time to choose what they read, time to read without interruption, and time to develop sustained reading habits. This is not 'free time' or 'quiet time' but purposeful reading time during which children make choices about their reading and develop the stamina and concentration that reading requires.

**Booktalk**
Informal, conversational talk about books, authors, and reading experiences is central to reading for pleasure. Booktalk creates communities of readers, extends reading repertoires through recommendation, and validates children's reading choices. Unlike comprehension questioning, booktalk is genuinely conversational, with no right or wrong answers.

**Reading Environments**
Physical environments matter. Reading for pleasure flourishes in spaces that are inviting, comfortable, and filled with attractive, diverse, and current books. The classroom library should be a focal point, regularly refreshed and prominently positioned. Children should have access to a wide range of texts and formats.

**Social Reading Practices**
Reading communities extend beyond individual classrooms. Whole-school reading initiatives, reading buddies, book clubs, author visits, and connections with libraries all contribute to a culture where reading is valued and talked about.

**Teacher Knowledge and Enthusiasm**
As the TaRs research demonstrates, teachers who read and know children's literature are better positioned to match children with books, make recommendations, and engage in authentic booktalk.

### Reading for Pleasure and Educational Outcomes

Cremin's work consistently argues that reading for pleasure is not in opposition to educational standards but foundational to them. Research demonstrates that children who read for pleasure:

- Achieve higher attainment in reading assessments
- Develop larger vocabularies
- Gain broader general knowledge
- Demonstrate greater empathy and understanding of others
- Show improved wellbeing and mental health
- Develop more positive attitudes towards learning

Reading for pleasure pedagogy thus serves both intrinsic and instrumental purposes—fostering a love of reading while supporting academic achievement. The evidence suggests that these are not competing goals but complementary ones.

## Creative Approaches to Writing

While Cremin is perhaps best known for her work on reading for pleasure, her research on creative writing and writing pedagogy is equally significant. She has explored how creativity can be fostered through and in writing, examining both teachers' identities as writers and the pedagogical approaches that support children's creative development.

### Teachers as Writers

Paralleling her work on teachers as readers, Cremin has investigated teachers' identities as writers. Her research reveals that many teachers lack confidence as writers and have limited experience of writing beyond professional and academic contexts. This has implications for writing pedagogy:

- Teachers who write themselves are better able to understand the writing process and its challenges
- Teachers who identify as writers are more likely to create authentic writing contexts for children
- Teachers' attitudes towards writing influence the writing identities available to children

Cremin advocates for teachers to engage in writing practices—both personal and professional—to develop their identities as writers alongside their identities as writing teachers. This might include keeping a writer's notebook, writing alongside children in the classroom, and sharing their own writing processes and products.

### Possibility Thinking and Creativity

Cremin's earlier research with colleague Anna Craft explored 'possibility thinking'—the creative engagement patterns through which children and adults pose questions, explore ideas, and imagine alternatives. In relation to writing, possibility thinking manifests when children:

- Play with language and form
- Imagine alternative perspectives and scenarios
- Take risks with their writing
- Experiment with voice and style
- Collaborate and build on others' ideas

Teachers who foster possibility thinking create classrooms where writing is exploratory and generative rather than merely performative.

### Reading and Writing Connections

Cremin's more recent work, including the Reading and Writing for Pleasure Framework for Practice (Cremin et al., 2024), emphasises the interconnected nature of reading and writing. Children who read widely and for pleasure develop internal models of what writing can do and be, absorb vocabulary, syntax, and narrative structures, gain knowledge of genres and authorial voices, and build the stamina and concentration needed for writing.

Similarly, writing can deepen reading engagement by helping children understand texts from the inside—as writers themselves. The two practices are mutually reinforcing.

### The Reading and Writing for Pleasure Framework

Funded by the Mercers' Company (2020-2023), Cremin and colleagues developed a comprehensive framework for practice that brings together research on reading and writing for pleasure. This framework, which draws on extensive research review and data from six London-based literacy charities, provides an evidence-informed basis for practice across homes, schools, libraries, and communities.

The framework identifies seven interconnected dimensions:

1. **Reading Communities** — creating social contexts where reading and writing are valued and talked about
2. **Reading and Writing Rich Environments** — physical and virtual spaces filled with diverse, attractive texts
3. **Independent Reading and Writing** — protected time for choice-led engagement with texts
4. **Read Aloud and Performance** — skilled reading aloud and opportunities for writing performance
5. **Informal Book and Writing Talk** — conversational, non-evaluative talk about texts
6. **Knowledge of Children's Literature and Writing** — teachers' and children's developing knowledge of texts and authors
7. **Identities as Readers and Writers** — fostering positive, agentive identities

This framework represents a comprehensive approach to literacy that positions pleasure, agency, and community at its heart.

## Building Reading Communities

A recurring theme throughout Cremin's work is the importance of community in fostering reading for pleasure. Reading is fundamentally social, and reading communities—both within and beyond classrooms—are essential for nurturing engaged readers.

### Characteristics of Reading Communities

Cremin identifies several characteristics of effective reading communities:

**Shared Purpose**
Members of reading communities share a commitment to reading and to talking about reading. This shared purpose creates cohesion and motivation. Everyone in the community understands that reading matters and is valued.

**Reciprocity**
Reading communities are characterised by reciprocal relationships. Teachers recommend books to children; children recommend books to teachers and to each other. Everyone is positioned as a reader with something to contribute, regardless of age or expertise.

**Diversity of Voice**
Effective reading communities embrace diversity of taste and preference. There is no single 'right' way to be a reader, and the community values different genres, formats, and reading practices. Graphic novels, audiobooks, magazines, and classic literature all have their place.

**Beyond the Classroom**
Reading communities extend beyond classroom walls to include families, libraries, bookshops, and online spaces. Schools that build connections with these wider communities strengthen children's reading networks.

### Strategies for Building Reading Communities

Cremin's research identifies practical strategies for building reading communities in schools:

**Reading Groups and Book Clubs**
Regular, informal groups where children and adults come together to discuss books, share recommendations, and enjoy reading together. These should be genuinely social and non-compulsory.

**Reading Ambassadors and Buddies**
Programmes that pair older and younger readers, creating mentoring relationships and extending reading communities across age groups.

**Author and Illustrator Engagement**
Visits, virtual sessions, and ongoing correspondence with authors and illustrators help children understand the human stories behind books and feel part of a wider literary community.

**Whole-School Initiatives**
Reading events, celebrations, and shared reading experiences that create collective momentum and signal that reading matters across the school.

**Family and Community Connections**
Initiatives that engage families as reading partners, recognising that children's reading lives extend far beyond the school gate.

## Implications for Curriculum and Pedagogy

Cremin's research has significant implications for English curriculum design and pedagogy.

### Curriculum Time and Structure

Schools must protect time for reading for pleasure: daily reading aloud by skilled teachers, protected independent reading time, space for informal booktalk, and regular engagement with reading communities.

### Teacher Professional Development

Effective reading for pleasure pedagogy requires ongoing professional development focused on developing teachers' knowledge of children's literature and
