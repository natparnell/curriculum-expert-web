# Pie Corbett: Talk for Writing and Creative Writing Pedagogy

## Biographical Overview

Pie Corbett (born 3 April 1954) is an English educational trainer, writer, author, and poet who has made an indelible mark on primary English education in the United Kingdom. With over two hundred published books to his name, Corbett is best known as the creator of Talk for Writing, an approach to teaching writing that has been adopted by thousands of schools across the UK and internationally.

Corbett's career has spanned multiple roles: classroom teacher, university lecturer, government adviser, and independent educational consultant. He advised the National Literacy Strategy for both the Primary and Key Stage 3 phases, shaping national policy on English teaching. His work on the DfES Innovations project on 'Storymaking' established foundational practices that continue to influence how creative writing is taught in British schools today.

Beyond his educational writing, Corbett is an accomplished poet and author of children's fiction. His creative work informs his pedagogical approach, giving him unique insight into the writing process from both the practitioner's and the teacher's perspective. He was also the creator of the Storymaking Schools Programme for the Story Museum in Oxford and developed the poetry objectives for the original National Literacy Strategy.

## Theoretical Foundations

### The Role of Oral Language in Writing Development

Corbett's approach rests on a fundamental premise: children cannot write what they cannot say. This insight, grounded in research into language acquisition and cognitive development, positions oral language as the foundation of writing competence. Before children can craft written narratives, they need to internalise the patterns, structures, and rhythms of written language through spoken rehearsal.

The Talk for Writing approach recognises that writing is not merely the transcription of thought but a complex cognitive activity involving multiple simultaneous demands: generating ideas, organising content, selecting vocabulary, applying grammatical conventions, and managing transcription (spelling and handwriting). By separating these demands and addressing them sequentially, Corbett's method reduces cognitive load and enables children to focus on developing each aspect of writing competence systematically.

### Social Constructivism and Vygotskian Principles

Corbett's pedagogy aligns closely with Vygotskian social constructivism, emphasising the role of social interaction in learning. Children learn to write by participating in writing communities, guided by more expert practitioners. The Talk for Writing classroom functions as a community of practice where writing is modelled, shared, discussed, and collaboratively constructed before children attempt independent composition.

The approach emphasises what Vygotsky termed the 'zone of proximal development'—the gap between what children can do independently and what they can achieve with appropriate scaffolding. Corbett's structured phases provide precisely this scaffolding, gradually withdrawing support as children's competence develops. The teacher's role shifts from expert guide (during imitation) to collaborative partner (during innovation) to distant observer (during independent application).

### Genre Theory and Writing Across the Curriculum

Corbett's approach draws on genre theory, recognising that different types of writing serve different purposes and follow different structural patterns. Children need explicit instruction in the conventions of different genres—narrative, recount, explanation, persuasion, instruction—if they are to write effectively across the curriculum.

This genre-focused approach challenges the romantic notion that children will naturally discover how to write through uninstructed practice. Instead, Corbett argues for explicit modelling of genre features, enabling children to recognise, internalise, and eventually independently deploy the language patterns associated with different text types. This positions writing as a craft that can be taught systematically rather than a mysterious talent that some children possess and others lack.

## The Talk for Writing Process: The Three Is

### Phase 1: Imitation

The imitation phase forms the foundation of the Talk for Writing approach. During this phase, children internalise a high-quality model text through repeated oral rehearsal, creating what Corbett terms 'deep structure' familiarity with the linguistic patterns they will eventually use in their own writing.

#### Text Selection and Analysis

The process begins with the selection of an engaging, well-written model text that exemplifies the target genre and age-appropriate linguistic features. This text becomes the central focus of learning for several weeks. Teachers read the text aloud expressively, drawing children's attention to its patterns, vocabulary, and structural features.

Corbett emphasises that the chosen text should be slightly beyond children's independent reading level—challenging enough to stretch their language development but accessible enough to be engaging. Poetry, traditional tales, and carefully crafted contemporary fiction all serve as effective model texts.

#### Story Mapping and Text Mapping

Central to the imitation phase is the creation of visual text maps. Working together, teacher and children create a pictorial representation of the text, with simple drawings or symbols representing key events, phrases, or sections. These maps serve multiple purposes: they provide a visual memory aid, reduce the cognitive demands of verbatim recall, and make the text's structure explicit.

Corbett describes how children use these maps to 'step' through the text, physically moving and gesturing as they retell it. This multi-sensory approach—combining visual, kinaesthetic, and auditory channels—supports memory and internalisation. Children who struggle with traditional literacy approaches often thrive in this physical, playful engagement with text.

For non-narrative genres, similar mapping techniques apply: flowcharts for instructions, timelines for recounts, branching diagrams for explanations. The principle remains consistent: make the text's structure visible and memorable.

#### Talk and Drama Activities

Throughout the imitation phase, children engage in varied talk activities: paired retelling, group performances, hot-seating characters, and dramatic reconstructions. These activities serve multiple pedagogical purposes. They provide repeated exposure to the target language patterns, developing children's 'linguistic ear'. They build confidence and fluency in oral expression. They deepen comprehension by requiring children to inhabit the text rather than merely decode it.

Corbett emphasises the importance of 'talking the text' until it becomes part of children's linguistic repertoire. This is not mechanical memorisation but creative appropriation—children make the text their own through playful engagement, adapting and personalising as they internalise its patterns.

#### Text Boxing and Structural Analysis

As children become fluent in retelling the model text, teachers introduce 'boxing up' activities. The text is divided into sections (typically introduction, build-up, problem, resolution, and ending for narratives), with children identifying the function of each section and the techniques used to achieve that function.

This structural analysis makes explicit what expert writers do intuitively. Children learn that effective writing follows predictable patterns: introductions establish setting and character; build-ups create tension through carefully sequenced events; problems present obstacles that drive the narrative forward; resolutions provide satisfying closure. Understanding these patterns enables children to plan and write their own texts with greater confidence and competence.

### Phase 2: Innovation

Once children have thoroughly internalised the model text, the innovation phase begins. Here, children adapt and modify the original, applying the patterns they have learned to new content while maintaining the structural and linguistic features that make the text effective.

#### Shared Innovation

Innovation typically begins with shared writing sessions where the teacher models the process of adapting the text. Working collaboratively with the class, the teacher demonstrates how to change characters, settings, or events while preserving the underlying structure. This shared phase makes the innovation process visible and explicit, enabling children to participate in decision-making about content and language choices.

Corbett emphasises that shared innovation is not simply substitution but genuine transformation. Children learn to recognise which elements of the text are fixed (generic conventions that must be maintained) and which are flexible (content details that can be changed). This develops their understanding of how texts work at both surface and deep levels.

#### Guided Innovation

As children develop confidence, innovation becomes increasingly independent. Working in pairs or small groups, children adapt the text with decreasing teacher scaffolding. The teacher circulates, providing targeted support where needed and drawing attention to particularly effective innovations that can be shared with the whole class.

During guided innovation, children typically produce multiple variations—different versions of the same basic structure with varied content. This repetition with variation consolidates their understanding of the underlying patterns while developing their capacity for creative adaptation.

#### Toolkits and Success Criteria

Throughout the innovation phase, teachers introduce writing toolkits: explicit lists of the linguistic features that characterise effective writing in the target genre. For narrative writing, toolkits might include: varied sentence openers, descriptive adjectives and adverbs, dialogue punctuated correctly, paragraphs organised around a single idea, and expressive verbs.

These toolkits serve multiple purposes. They make success criteria explicit and transparent, enabling children to understand what they are aiming for. They support self- and peer-assessment, as children can check their writing against the toolkit criteria. They provide concrete targets for improvement, helping children identify specific aspects of their writing to develop.

Corbett advocates for co-constructing toolkits with children, drawing examples from the model text and from published literature. This collaborative construction ensures that toolkits are understood and owned by learners rather than being imposed as arbitrary requirements.

### Phase 3: Invention (Independent Application)

The final phase of the Talk for Writing process sees children applying what they have learned to create entirely independent texts. Drawing on the patterns internalised during imitation and practised during innovation, children now generate their own content within the conventions of the target genre.

#### Planning and Preparation

Invention begins with planning. Children draw on their experience of text boxing to structure their ideas, creating story maps or planning grids that map out their narrative or non-fiction text. This planning phase is essential: children who attempt to write without clear plans typically produce meandering, understructured texts.

Corbett emphasises that planning should be quick and flexible rather than elaborate and constraining. The goal is to establish a clear structure that guides writing without stifling creativity. Children should feel free to deviate from their plans as better ideas emerge during the writing process.

#### Independent Composition

During independent composition, children write their texts, drawing on the linguistic patterns practised throughout the unit. The model text serves as a mental template: children know what effective writing in this genre sounds like because they have internalised an exemplar.

The teacher's role during independent composition is to provide minimal interruption while remaining available for support. Some children may continue to reference their text maps; others will have internalised the structure sufficiently to write fluently without external aids. The teacher monitors progress, intervening only when children are stuck or when specific teaching points emerge from observation of their writing.

#### Editing and Refinement

Following initial composition, children engage in editing and refinement. Drawing on their toolkits and success criteria, they review their work, identifying areas for improvement and making revisions. Corbett advocates for teaching editing as a distinct skill, with specific strategies for checking spelling, punctuation, vocabulary choices, and sentence construction.

Peer editing can be valuable, with children providing feedback on each other's work using structured formats. However, Corbett cautions that peer feedback requires careful modelling and scaffolding if it is to be constructive rather than superficial.

#### Publication and Performance

The Talk for Writing cycle culminates in publication or performance. Children present their finished work—reading aloud, displaying on classroom walls, publishing in class books, or sharing with other classes or parents. This public dimension gives writing purpose and audience, motivating children to craft their work with care and pride.

Publication also serves an important pedagogical function. When children see their work alongside the model text and their classmates' writing, they develop critical awareness of what makes writing effective. They learn to read as writers, analysing how different authors achieve their effects.

## Key Pedagogical Strategies

### Reading as a Writer

A cornerstone of Corbett's approach is teaching children to 'read as writers'—to approach published texts not merely as readers seeking meaning but as writers seeking craft techniques. This involves explicit analysis of how writers achieve their effects: the sentence structures they employ, the vocabulary they select, the pacing they create through paragraphing and sequencing.

Corbett recommends maintaining 'reading journals' where children collect examples of effective writing they encounter in their reading. These collected examples serve as personal toolkits, providing models and inspiration for their own composition. Over time, children build up repertoires of techniques they can deploy in their own writing.

### The Poetry Objectives

Corbett's work on the National Literacy Strategy included developing the poetry objectives that remain influential in primary classrooms. He argues for the particular importance of poetry in developing children's linguistic sensitivity and expressive capacity.

Poetry, Corbett suggests, provides concentrated exposure to linguistic patterning—rhythm, rhyme, alliteration, imagery—in ways that develop children's 'ear' for language. Regular engagement with poetry enhances children's vocabulary, syntactic awareness, and capacity for figurative expression. These capacities transfer directly to their prose writing, enriching their descriptive and narrative composition.

Corbett advocates for children learning poems by heart through the same oral rehearsal techniques used in Talk for Writing. This memorisation is not rote learning but deep internalisation of linguistic patterns that become available for creative appropriation in children's own writing.

### Grammar in Context

Corbett is a prominent advocate for teaching grammar in context rather than as isolated rules. Grammatical understanding, he argues, develops most effectively when children encounter patterns in meaningful texts and explore how those patterns contribute to meaning and effect.

In the Talk for Writing classroom, grammar teaching arises organically from exploration of the model text. If the text includes effective use of fronted adverbials, the teacher draws attention to this pattern, explores its function, and encourages children to try it in their own writing. Grammar is thus always connected to craft, purpose, and effect rather than being an abstract system of rules.

This contextualised approach addresses the limitations of decontextualised grammar exercises, which research suggests have limited impact on writing quality. Children who can identify fronted adverbials in worksheets may not deploy them effectively in their own writing unless they understand their rhetorical function.

### Storymaking and the Creative Process

Corbett's work on the DfES Storymaking project explored the creative processes underlying narrative composition. Storymaking goes beyond story writing to encompass the oral creation and sharing of narratives—a practice with deep roots in human culture that predates and supports written composition.

The Storymaking approach emphasises the improvisational, collaborative nature of narrative creation. Children create stories together, building on each other's contributions in ways that model the narrative thinking underlying individual composition. This collaborative practice develops children's narrative competence in a supportive, playful context before they attempt independent written work.

Corbett connects storymaking to broader educational goals: developing imagination, building community through shared narrative, and preserving the oral storytelling traditions that remain culturally significant. In an age of digital communication, he argues, the capacity to create and share stories orally remains a fundamental human skill.

## Application Across the Curriculum

### Non-Fiction Genres

While Talk for Writing is often associated with narrative, Corbett's approach applies equally to non-fiction genres. Explanation texts, persuasive writing, instructions, recounts, and discussion texts all follow predictable patterns that can be modelled, internalised, and innovated using the three-phase approach.

For each genre, teachers identify high-quality model texts that exemplify the genre's conventions. Children internalise these texts through the same oral rehearsal and mapping techniques used for narratives, developing familiarity with the linguistic features that characterise effective non-fiction writing.

The innovation phase is particularly important for non-fiction, as children learn to apply generic structures to varied content areas. A child who has internalised the structure of explanation texts can apply this understanding to explain scientific processes, historical causes, or geographical phenomena.

### Cross-Curricular Writing

Corbett's genre-focused approach supports writing across the curriculum. By teaching children the conventions of different text types, teachers provide tools for expressing learning in subjects beyond English. A child who understands how to write an effective explanation can demonstrate scientific understanding; one who has mastered persuasive structures can engage with historical debate.

This cross-curricular application requires subject teachers to understand and reinforce the writing conventions taught in English lessons. Corbett advocates for whole-school approaches to writing, with consistent language and frameworks used across subject areas. When all teachers draw on the same toolkit vocabulary and success criteria, children receive coherent messages about what effective writing looks like.

### Transition to Secondary

Corbett's work on Key Stage 3 literacy recognises that the principles underlying Talk for Writing remain relevant as children move into secondary education. The challenges of transition—more complex subject content, varied teacher expectations, greater emphasis on extended writing—can be addressed by continuing to provide model texts, explicit structure, and scaffolded support.

Secondary teachers sometimes assume that by Key Stage 3, children should be able to write independently without the extensive scaffolding used in primary classrooms. Corbett challenges this assumption, arguing that all writers benefit from models and structures, particularly when tackling unfamiliar genres or challenging content. The forms of scaffolding may change—older children may not need physical text maps—but the underlying principle of providing models for internalisation and adaptation remains valid.

## Critical Reception and Evidence Base

### Research Support

The Talk for Writing approach aligns with established research on writing instruction. Graham and Perin's (2007) meta-analysis of writing instruction identified strategy instruction, self-regulation, and text structure as particularly effective approaches—all central to Corbett's method. The emphasis on oral rehearsal draws on research into working memory and cognitive load, recognising that children cannot attend simultaneously to all aspects of writing.

Case studies and school-level evaluations have reported positive impacts on writing attainment where Talk for Writing has been implemented with fidelity. Schools typically report improvements in both the technical accuracy and creative quality of children's writing, with particular benefits for children who struggle with conventional approaches.

### Critiques and Limitations

Critics have raised concerns about the potential for Talk for Writing to become overly formulaic. If every child produces writing that follows the same template, where is the space for genuine creativity and individual voice? Corbett responds that innovation and invention phases should produce varied outcomes, with the model text serving as a foundation for rather than constraint upon creative expression.

Others have questioned whether extensive time spent on imitation might limit the volume of writing children produce. If a unit extends over three weeks with only the final week producing independent writing, children may write less overall than with daily composition practice. Proponents counter that the quality and development shown in Talk for Writing outcomes exceeds that of more frequent but less scaffolded writing.

The approach also requires significant teacher expertise and planning time. Creating effective model texts, developing appropriate innovations, and managing the gradual release of responsibility demand professional knowledge and preparation. Schools adopting Talk for Writing typically invest in extensive training and ongoing support.

## Practical Implementation Guidance

### Getting Started

Schools beginning Talk for Writing implementation should start with clear whole-school policies and training. Corbett emphasises that superficial adoption—using text maps occasionally without understanding the underlying principles—produces limited benefits. Genuine implementation requires shifts in teacher understanding and classroom practice.
