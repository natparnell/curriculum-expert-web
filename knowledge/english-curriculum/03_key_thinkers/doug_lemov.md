# Doug Lemov: Teach Like a Champion and Reading Reconsidered

**Doug Lemov** (born 1967) is an American educator, author, and teacher trainer whose work has fundamentally shaped contemporary approaches to classroom instruction and literacy teaching. As the founder of Teach Like a Champion and the author of the bestselling *Teach Like a Champion* series and *Reading Reconsidered*, Lemov has codified the techniques of exceptional teachers into practical, replicable strategies that have been adopted by schools worldwide, including significant influence within the United Kingdom education system.

## Biography and Background

### Early Career and Uncommon Schools

Lemov began his career in education as a teacher and later served as a principal and Managing Director at Uncommon Schools, one of the highest-performing charter school networks in the United States. Working within the Uncommon Schools network, which primarily serves disadvantaged urban communities, Lemov became fascinated by the question of what made certain teachers exceptionally effective. This curiosity led him to study teaching through a new lens—not through the traditional focus on personality or innate talent, but through the systematic observation and documentation of specific behaviours and techniques.

### The Teach Like a Champion Origin

In 2010, Lemov published the first edition of *Teach Like a Champion: 49 Techniques that Put Students on the Path to College*. The book emerged from his extensive video analysis of hundreds of classrooms, where he identified specific, concrete techniques that high-performing teachers used consistently. Unlike much educational literature that focused on abstract philosophy, Lemov's work was distinguished by its granular focus on observable, practicable actions that teachers could implement immediately.

The book's success was remarkable. It became required reading in many teacher training programmes and has sold hundreds of thousands of copies globally. The *Guardian* described Lemov as "the American who wrote Britain's latest teaching bible," noting how his work had been explicitly incorporated into the new teacher training curriculum in England.

## Teach Like a Champion: Core Philosophy and Techniques

### Research Methodology

Lemov's methodology represented a departure from traditional educational research. Rather than relying on student outcome data alone or theoretical frameworks, he used video recording to capture thousands of hours of classroom instruction. By studying these recordings frame by frame, Lemov identified patterns in how exceptional teachers managed classrooms, delivered content, checked for understanding, and engaged students. This approach treated teaching as a craft that could be studied, codified, and taught—much like analysing the techniques of elite athletes or musicians.

### The Three Domains of Teaching Excellence

The *Teach Like a Champion* framework organises techniques into three interconnected domains:

**1. Check for Understanding (CFU)**

Lemov argues that the most critical skill in teaching is the ability to constantly verify what students have actually learned, rather than simply what has been presented. The CFU domain includes techniques such as:

- **Cold Call**: Asking questions of students regardless of whether they have volunteered, ensuring all students remain engaged and accountable
- **Wait Time**: Deliberately pausing after asking a question to allow students processing time before expecting responses
- **Call and Response**: Using unison verbal responses to build engagement and check whole-class understanding quickly
- **Show Call**: Displaying student work to analyse successes and errors publicly
- **Everybody Writes**: Requiring all students to produce written responses before discussion, ensuring every student engages with the question

**2. Academic Ethos**

This domain focuses on creating a classroom culture of high expectations and rigorous thinking. Key techniques include:

- **No Opt Out**: Refusing to accept "I don't know" as a final answer, instead returning to students after providing support or asking follow-up questions
- **Right is Right**: Insisting on complete, precise answers rather than accepting partially correct responses
- **Stretch It**: Following correct answers with follow-up questions that extend thinking and verify deep understanding
- **Format Matters**: Insisting on complete sentences, proper grammar, and academic register in student responses

**3. Ratio**

Lemov's concept of "ratio" refers to the proportion of cognitive work done by students versus teachers. Techniques in this domain aim to shift the burden of thinking onto students:

- **Break It Down**: Scaffolding complex tasks into manageable steps while maintaining student ownership
- **Batch Process**: Managing multiple classroom tasks efficiently to maximise instructional time
- **Socratic Questioning**: Using strategic questioning to guide students toward understanding rather than telling them answers
- **Turn and Talk**: Structured partner discussions that increase student participation and verbal processing

### Teach Like a Champion 3.0

Published in 2021, the third edition expanded the framework to 63 techniques and incorporated insights from cognitive science, behavioural economics, and additional years of classroom observation. The 3.0 edition places greater emphasis on:

- **Writing-intensive classrooms**: Techniques for embedding writing across the curriculum
- **Motivation and engagement**: Strategies for building student investment in learning
- **Culture of error**: Creating classroom environments where mistakes are normalised and used as learning opportunities
- **Systems and routines**: The infrastructure that enables smooth classroom operation

## Reading Reconsidered: A Framework for Rigorous Literacy Instruction

### The Four Pillars of the Reading Core

Published in 2016 with co-authors Colleen Driggs and Erica Woolway, *Reading Reconsidered: A Practical Guide to Rigorous Literacy Instruction* represents Lemov's systematic approach to teaching reading. The book is structured around four essential elements that the authors argue constitute the "Core of the Core" for reading instruction:

**1. Read Harder Texts**

Lemov challenges the pervasive practice of matching students with texts at their assessed reading level. Drawing on research about the "Matthew Effect"—where students who read more challenging texts develop vocabulary and background knowledge at faster rates than those reading simpler texts—he argues for systematically exposing all students to grade-level or above-grade-level texts. This approach, he contends, is particularly important for disadvantaged students who may lack the background knowledge and vocabulary that middle-class students acquire outside school.

The book provides strategies for making challenging texts accessible, including:
- **Layered reading**: Multiple encounters with a text at increasing depths of analysis
- **Background knowledge building**: Pre-teaching necessary context before reading
- **Text-dependent questions**: Focusing student attention on evidence within the text rather than personal connections

**2. Close Read Texts Rigorously and Intentionally**

Lemov codifies close reading—a term often used vaguely—into specific instructional practices. His approach includes:

- **Establishing meaning first**: Ensuring literal comprehension before moving to analysis
- **Text-dependent questioning**: Crafting questions that require reference to specific textual evidence
- **Layered analysis**: Revisiting texts multiple times with different analytical lenses
- **Annotation strategies**: Teaching students systematic approaches to marking and engaging with texts

**3. Read More Nonfiction**

Recognising that college and career success requires facility with informational texts, Lemov argues for substantially increasing the proportion of nonfiction in school reading programmes. The book provides frameworks for selecting high-quality nonfiction texts and strategies for teaching them effectively, acknowledging that nonfiction presents distinct challenges including density of information, unfamiliar text structures, and vocabulary demands.

**4. Write More**

Lemov argues that writing is not merely a skill to be taught in isolation but a fundamental tool for developing reading comprehension. The book provides strategies for integrating writing throughout reading instruction, including:

- **Sentence-level writing**: The "Art of the Sentence" technique for developing syntactic complexity
- **Evidence-based writing**: Structuring written responses to require textual support
- **Revision as thinking**: Using writing revision to deepen analytical understanding

### Text Selection: The Five Plagues of the Developing Reader

One of Lemov's most influential contributions to reading pedagogy is his identification of the "Five Plagues of the Developing Reader"—specific challenges that texts present which can impede comprehension if not explicitly taught:

**1. Archaic Language**

Texts using vocabulary, syntax, or conventions from earlier periods of English (such as Shakespeare or the King James Bible) require readers to navigate unfamiliar linguistic terrain. Lemov argues that exposure to such texts must be deliberate and supported with explicit instruction in linguistic features.

**2. Non-Linear Time Sequences**

Many sophisticated texts employ flashbacks, flash-forwards, or complex temporal structures that can confuse readers. Lemov advocates explicitly teaching students to recognise and navigate these structures.

**3. Complexity of Narrator**

Unreliable narrators, multiple perspectives, or complex narrative voices require readers to maintain critical distance and evaluate sources of information. These texts demand more sophisticated reading strategies than straightforward narratives.

**4. Complexity of Story**

Texts with multiple plotlines, large casts of characters, or intricate causal relationships place significant demands on working memory. Lemov suggests strategies for helping students track and synthesise complex narrative information.

**5. Resistant Texts**

Some texts—often highly valued in academic contexts—are deliberately difficult, requiring persistence and the application of multiple reading strategies. Lemov argues that students must develop stamina and technique for engaging with such texts.

### Vocabulary Instruction

*Reading Reconsidered* provides detailed guidance on vocabulary instruction, emphasising:

- **Explicit instruction**: Direct teaching of word meanings rather than relying solely on context clues
- **Morphology**: Teaching roots, prefixes, and suffixes to build word analysis skills
- **Academic vocabulary**: Focusing on high-utility academic words (Tier 2 vocabulary) that appear across content areas
- **Synonym development**: Building students' networks of related words to develop precision in expression
- **Distributed practice**: Spacing vocabulary review across time to support retention

## Classroom Culture and Systems

### The Culture of Error

A recurring theme in Lemov's work is the importance of creating what he terms a "culture of error"—classroom environments where mistakes are expected, normalised, and used as learning opportunities. This culture enables techniques like Cold Call and Show Call, which would be punitive in high-stakes environments but become productive when students understand that errors are part of learning.

### Procedures and Routines

Lemov emphasises that exceptional teaching depends on invisible infrastructure—routines and procedures that make classrooms function efficiently. Rather than relying on charisma or authority to manage behaviour, Lemov advocates establishing clear, practised routines for:

- Entering and exiting the classroom
- Distributing and collecting materials
- Transitions between activities
- Requesting and receiving help
- Participating in discussions

These routines, once internalised by students, free cognitive resources for academic engagement.

### Positive Framing

Lemov's approach to behaviour management emphasises positive framing—describing what students should do rather than what they should not do. This technique, grounded in behavioural psychology, focuses attention on desired behaviours and maintains a constructive classroom tone.

## Impact on UK Education

### Teacher Training Curriculum

Lemov's influence in the United Kingdom has been substantial and officially recognised. According to Parents and Teachers for Excellence, "the new teacher training curriculum in England explicitly includes a Lemovian approach to running a room." This incorporation represents a significant shift toward technique-focused teacher preparation, moving away from abstract educational theory toward practicable classroom skills.

### Adoption by Academy Chains

Numerous academy chains and multi-academy trusts in England have adopted Lemov's techniques as part of their standard pedagogical approach. Ark Teacher Training, for example, has featured Lemov prominently in their professional development programmes, and many schools use *Teach Like a Champion* as a core text for instructional coaching.

### Professional Development

Lemov's video-based approach to teacher development has influenced how schools in the UK conduct instructional coaching. The practice of recording lessons for analysis, once rare, has become more common as schools have adopted Lemov's methodology of studying teaching through concrete observation rather than abstract evaluation.

## Pedagogical Approach: Craft, Science, and Art

### Teaching as Craft

Lemov consistently frames teaching as a craft—a domain of expertise that can be developed through study, practice, and feedback. This perspective challenges romantic notions of teaching as purely intuitive or personality-driven. By identifying specific techniques and providing concrete guidance for their implementation, Lemov makes the case that teaching excellence can be systematically cultivated.

### Integration with Cognitive Science

In recent work, particularly *The Teach Like a Champion Guide to the Science of Reading* (2024), Lemov has increasingly integrated findings from cognitive science into his frameworks. This includes attention to:

- Working memory limitations and instructional design
- The role of background knowledge in comprehension
- Retrieval practice and spaced repetition for memory consolidation
- The importance of automaticity in foundational skills

### The Limits of Technique

While Lemov's work is technique-focused, he acknowledges that techniques alone do not constitute excellent teaching. Context matters—techniques must be adapted to particular students, subjects, and situations. Moreover, Lemov argues that techniques serve larger purposes: building knowledge, developing critical thinking, and fostering student agency. The techniques are means, not ends.

## Critiques and Debates

### Concerns About Behaviourism

Critics have argued that Lemov's approach, with its emphasis on specific techniques and behavioural management, reflects an overly behaviourist philosophy of education. Some contend that techniques like Cold Call and No Opt Out prioritise compliance over authentic engagement, potentially creating stressful environments for anxious students.

### The Uncommon Schools Context

Lemov developed his techniques within the high-stakes, high-accountability environment of American charter schools serving disadvantaged communities. Critics note that techniques designed for these contexts may not translate directly to different educational cultures, including the more varied landscape of English maintained schools.

### The Question of Adaptation

Some educators argue that Lemov's emphasis on specific, codified techniques risks creating mechanistic teaching that fails to respond to the dynamic, improvisational nature of classroom interaction. They contend that effective teaching requires contextual judgement that cannot be reduced to technique lists.

### Response to Critiques

Lemov and his advocates respond that the techniques are tools to be used judiciously, not rigid prescriptions. They argue that the framework provides a foundation upon which teachers can build, not a ceiling that constrains them. Moreover, they note that the techniques have been successfully adapted across diverse contexts worldwide, suggesting their broader applicability.

## Practical Applications for English Teachers

### Implementing Close Reading

For English teachers, Lemov's close reading framework offers concrete strategies for teaching literary analysis:

1. **Begin with establishing meaning**: Before analysis, ensure students understand what is literally happening in a text through targeted questioning.

2. **Use layered reading**: Plan multiple encounters with significant texts—first for comprehension, then for analysis of specific elements (character, theme, language), then for synthesis.

3. **Teach annotation explicitly**: Rather than assuming students know how to annotate, model specific annotation strategies and provide structured opportunities for practice.

4. **Craft text-dependent questions**: Design questions that require reference to specific passages and that build progressively from literal comprehension to inference to analysis.

### Building Vocabulary Through Literature

English teachers can apply Lemov's vocabulary principles by:

- Pre-teaching key vocabulary before reading challenging texts
- Using morphology instruction to build word analysis skills
- Creating synonym webs around key terms in literary analysis (e.g., different words for "shows," "suggests," "implies")
- Distributing vocabulary review across the curriculum rather than confining it to specific units

### Developing Writing Through Reading

Lemov's integration of reading and writing suggests strategies for English teachers:

- Use "Art of the Sentence" exercises to develop syntactic complexity through literary models
- Require evidence-based written responses that quote and analyse specific textual passages
- Structure revision activities that deepen analytical understanding of texts
- Embed writing throughout reading units rather than treating them as separate domains

### Managing Literature Discussions

Techniques from *Teach Like a Champion* can transform literature discussions:

- **Cold Call**: Ensure all students engage with interpretive questions, not just volunteers
- **Turn and Talk**: Build processing time and participation through structured partner discussions
- **Habits of Discussion**: Teach students specific sentence stems for building on, challenging, or clarifying peers' ideas
- **Wait Time**: Allow thinking time after complex interpretive questions before expecting responses

## Connections to Curriculum Thinking

### Knowledge-Rich Approaches

Lemov's emphasis on background knowledge, challenging texts, and academic vocabulary aligns with broader movements toward knowledge-rich curricula. His work provides practical tools for implementing curricula that prioritise substantive content over generic skills.

### Disciplinary Literacy

*Reading Reconsidered* contributes to the field of disciplinary literacy—the recognition that reading in different subjects requires distinct approaches. While focused primarily on English/literacy instruction, Lemov's framework illuminates how reading instruction must be adapted to the specific demands of literary study.

### Assessment and Progression

Lemov's techniques for checking for understanding provide teachers with tools for ongoing formative assessment. By constantly verifying student learning through techniques like Cold Call, Show Call, and Everybody Writes, teachers can make real-time adjustments to instruction.

## Legacy and Continuing Influence

Doug Lemov's work represents a significant contribution to the practical literature of teaching. By treating teaching as a craft that can be studied, codified, and taught, he has provided a framework that has influenced teacher preparation and professional development worldwide. His influence in the United Kingdom, officially recognised in teacher training curricula and widely adopted by academy chains, demonstrates the portability of his approach across educational contexts.

The ongoing evolution of the *Teach Like a Champion* framework—from 49 to 62 to 63 techniques, and from classroom management to literacy instruction to cognitive science—suggests a body of work that continues to develop in response to new research and practice. For English teachers specifically, *Reading Reconsidered* offers a comprehensive framework for rigorous literacy instruction that balances ambitious text selection with the scaffolding necessary to make such texts accessible to all students.

As debates about teaching methodology continue, Lemov's work remains a touchstone for those who believe that teaching excellence can be achieved not through personality or intuition alone, but through the disciplined development of craft knowledge and the systematic application of effective techniques.

## Implementation Guidance for Schools

### Getting Started with Lemov Techniques

Schools adopting Lemov's frameworks should consider a phased approach that allows teachers to develop expertise gradually rather than attempting to implement all techniques simultaneously.

**Phase 1: Foundation Techniques**

Begin with techniques that provide immediate impact on classroom culture and engagement:
- **Wait Time**: Requires no additional preparation but fundamentally changes the quality of student responses
- **Cold Call**: Establishes accountability and engagement when implemented within a culture of error
- **No Opt Out**: Communicates high expectations and ensures all students remain intellectually active
- **Right is Right**: Develops academic precision and rigour in student communication

**Phase 2: Checking for Understanding**

Once foundation techniques are established, introduce systematic approaches to verifying learning:
- **Everybody Writes**: Ensures all students process and commit to answers before discussion
- **Show Call**: Makes student thinking visible and creates opportunities for error analysis
- **Call and Response**: Provides rapid whole-class assessment of understanding
- **Exit Tickets**: Systematic collection of evidence about lesson objectives

**Phase 3: Advanced Techniques**

With foundational systems in place, teachers can develop more sophisticated techniques:
- **Stretch It**: Extending student thinking through strategic follow-up questioning
- **Habits of Discussion**: Teaching students to engage in genuine academic discourse
- **Art of the Sentence**: Developing syntactic complexity and precision in writing
- **Socratic Questioning**: Guiding students to discovery through carefully sequenced questions

### Coaching and Professional Development

Lemov's video-based methodology suggests specific approaches to teacher development:

**Video Analysis Protocols**

Rather than evaluating teaching through observation checklists, instructional coaches can use video to identify specific technique implementation:
1. Record short segments (5-10 minutes) of instruction
2. Review with teachers to identify technique opportunities
3. Focus on one technique at a time for development
4. Provide concrete, specific feedback about implementation
5. Allow teachers to observe their own practice and self-correct

**Practice and Rehearsal**

Lemov advocates for practising techniques outside the classroom before implementation:
- Rehearsing Cold Call sequences with colleagues
- Practising Wait Time to internalise appropriate pacing
- Developing automaticity in technique execution so cognitive resources remain available for instructional decision-making

### Adapting to Context

While Lemov's techniques are presented as universal, effective implementation requires adaptation to specific contexts:

**Primary Adaptations**

In primary settings, techniques may require:
- Shorter Wait Time appropriate to developmental stages
- Modified Cold Call approaches that maintain warmth and safety
- Greater emphasis on routines and procedures as foundations
- Integration of movement and physical engagement

**Secondary Adaptations**

In secondary settings, techniques may be adapted to:
- Support more sophisticated disciplinary thinking
- Manage longer instructional blocks and complex transitions
- Develop student metacognition about learning processes
- Build toward independent application of techniques by students

**Subject-Specific Adaptations**

Different subjects may emphasise different techniques:
- **Mathematics**: Strong emphasis on Show Call for error analysis, precise Format Matters for mathematical communication
- **Science**: Cold Call for hypothesis generation, Everybody Writes for experimental design
- **Humanities**: Stretch It for developing interpretive arguments, Habits of Discussion for textual analysis
- **Arts**: Wait Time for aesthetic reflection, positive framing for creative risk-taking

## The Role of School Leadership

### Creating Conditions for Success

School leaders play a critical role in supporting Lemov implementation:

**Protecting Practice Time**

Technique development requires protected time for rehearsal and reflection. Leaders should:
- Minimise non-instructional demands during implementation phases
- Provide regular, predictable time for professional practice
- Reduce other initiatives to maintain focus

**Modelling Techniques**

When leaders use techniques in staff meetings and professional development:
- Cold Call demonstrates that all voices matter
- Wait Time models respect for thinking
- No Opt Out communicates high expectations for staff as well as students
- Positive framing maintains constructive culture during change

**Developing Internal Expertise**

Rather than relying solely on external consultants, successful schools:
- Identify teachers who develop strong technique implementation
- Provide opportunities for these teachers to coach colleagues
- Build internal capacity for ongoing development
- Create professional learning communities focused on technique refinement

### Avoiding Implementation Pitfalls

Common challenges in adopting Lemov frameworks include:

**Technique Without Purpose**

When teachers implement techniques as ends rather than means, instruction can become mechanical. Leaders should ensure teachers understand:
- The pedagogical purpose behind each technique
- How techniques support specific learning objectives
- When techniques should be adapted or set aside based on context

**Inconsistent Implementation**

Techniques require consistent application to become effective. Leaders should:
- Monitor implementation through classroom visits focused on specific techniques
- Provide regular feedback about technique use
- Celebrate teachers who develop strong implementation
- Address inconsistency through coaching rather than evaluation

**Isolation from Broader Curriculum**

Techniques should support, not replace, thoughtful curriculum design. Leaders should:
- Ensure technique implementation serves curriculum goals
- Maintain focus on what students are learning, not just how
- Connect technique use to assessment of student learning

## The Future of Lemov's Work

### Ongoing Development

The evolution from 49 to 63 techniques, and from classroom management to literacy instruction to cognitive science, suggests Lemov's work will continue developing. Future directions may include:

**Technology Integration**

As digital tools transform classrooms, Lemov's frameworks may expand to address:
- Maintaining ratio in technology-rich environments
- Checking for understanding in asynchronous and hybrid settings
- Using video for remote teacher development

**Equity and Inclusion**

Growing attention to educational equity may influence technique development:
- Ensuring techniques support all learners, including those with additional needs
- Addressing concerns about cultural responsiveness
- Balancing high expectations with trauma-informed practice

**International Expansion**

As adoption spreads globally, frameworks may adapt to:
- Different educational systems and accountability structures
- Varied cultural expectations about teaching and learning
- Diverse language contexts

### Continuing Relevance

Despite critiques and debates, Lemov's fundamental insight—that teaching can be studied as a craft and that specific techniques can be identified, taught, and practised—continues to influence education. For teachers seeking to develop their practice, the *Teach Like a Champion* and *Reading Reconsidered* frameworks offer concrete starting points for professional growth.

The question is no longer whether teaching can be studied systematically, but how to balance technique with judgement, consistency with responsiveness, and standardisation with individual teacher voice. Lemov's work provides a foundation for this ongoing professional dialogue, offering practical tools while acknowledging that teaching excellence ultimately requires wisdom, care, and commitment that cannot be fully captured in technique lists.

For English teachers specifically, the integration of classroom management, literacy instruction, and cognitive science in Lemov's recent work offers a coherent framework for developing the knowledge, skills, and dispositions necessary to support all students in becoming confident, capable readers and writers.
