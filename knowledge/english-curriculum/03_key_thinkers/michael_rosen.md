# Michael Rosen: Children's Literature, Poetry Performance, and Reading for Pleasure

## Biographical Overview

Michael Rosen (born 1946) is one of the United Kingdom's most influential figures in children's literature and education. A prolific author, poet, performer, and broadcaster, Rosen has dedicated his career to making poetry and literature accessible, enjoyable, and meaningful for children. His work bridges the worlds of creative writing, educational theory, and classroom practice, making him a key thinker for English teachers seeking to develop pupils' engagement with literature.

Rosen served as the sixth Children's Laureate from 2007 to 2009, succeeding Jacqueline Wilson and preceding Anthony Browne. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (elected 2006) and has held academic positions including Visiting Professor of Children's Literature at the University of Reading and Professor of Children's Literature at Goldsmiths, University of London. With over 200 published books to his name, his influence on children's literature and literacy education in the UK is profound and enduring.

## Core Educational Philosophy

### The Centrality of Pleasure in Reading

At the heart of Rosen's educational philosophy is the conviction that reading should be a source of pleasure. This seemingly simple principle carries significant implications for pedagogy and policy. Rosen argues that reading for pleasure should not be treated as an optional extra or a reward for completing "real" work, but rather as fundamental to developing lifelong readers.

Rosen distinguishes between reading that is externally motivated (by tests, rewards, or adult pressure) and reading that is intrinsically motivated (driven by curiosity, enjoyment, and personal connection). His advocacy was instrumental in Ofsted's 2011 recommendation that every school should have a policy on "reading for enjoyment for all" (Moving English Forward, 2011).

In interviews, Rosen has emphasised that he wishes the term were "reading for pleasure for all" to stress the inclusive nature of this principle. He argues that reading for pleasure policies must address the needs of all pupils, including reluctant readers, those with dyslexia or other reading difficulties, and children from backgrounds with limited access to books.

### Performance and Embodied Poetry

Rosen's approach to poetry is fundamentally performative. He argues that poetry comes alive through performance—through the voice, gestures, and presence of the reader. This perspective challenges more traditional approaches that treat poetry primarily as a written text to be analysed on the page.

His school visits, which he continues to conduct several times a week, demonstrate this philosophy in action. Rather than simply reading his poems, Rosen performs them, using his entire body and vocal range to convey meaning, rhythm, and emotion. This modelling shows children and teachers alike that poetry is not an obscure art form requiring specialist knowledge, but a vibrant, accessible mode of expression.

The "Poetry Friendly Classroom" concept, which Rosen has developed extensively, provides a framework for embedding poetry into the everyday life of schools rather than treating it as an isolated unit of study.

### The Roald Dahl Funny Prize

During his tenure as Children's Laureate, Rosen established the Roald Dahl Funny Prize (now continued as a separate initiative) to celebrate humorous books for children. This initiative addressed a significant gap in literary recognition, as humorous books were often overlooked by major prizes despite their enormous popularity with young readers.

The prize reflects Rosen's understanding that humour is a powerful entry point into reading for many children. By legitimising funny books within the literary ecosystem, Rosen helped validate the reading preferences of children who might otherwise feel that their tastes were not "proper" reading.

## The Poetry Friendly Classroom

### Conceptual Framework

The Poetry Friendly Classroom is Rosen's signature contribution to poetry pedagogy. Rather than treating poetry as a discrete unit to be studied and tested, this approach seeks to embed poetry into the daily texture of classroom life.

Rosen argues that before children can write poetry that matters, teachers must create an environment where poetry is valued, enjoyed, and regularly encountered. This involves:

1. **Regular exposure to poetry** — Reading poems aloud frequently, without always requiring analytical response
2. **Performance opportunities** — Creating spaces where children can perform poems for one another
3. **A culture of experimentation** — Encouraging playful engagement with language without fear of "getting it wrong"
4. **Teacher modelling** — Teachers reading and performing poetry with enthusiasm

### Practical Implementation

Rosen's blog and published resources offer concrete strategies for implementing this approach:

**The Poetry Show**: Rosen recommends periodically "clearing the decks" to hold a "poetry show" where children choose poems to perform—solo, in pairs, or in groups. After performances, children discuss what they observed and might like to try themselves. This structure provides authentic purpose for practice and develops both performance skills and critical appreciation.

**Accumulation and Repertoire**: Rather than studying a single poem intensively and then moving on, Rosen advocates building a cumulative repertoire of poems that children can return to, perform repeatedly, and make their own. This approach treats poetry as an oral tradition to be inhabited rather than a text to be decoded.

**Teacher Performance**: Rosen encourages teachers to overcome any inhibitions about performing poetry. His own example demonstrates that effective performance does not require theatrical training but rather genuine engagement with the material and willingness to take risks.

## Reading for Pleasure Advocacy

### Policy Engagement

Rosen has been a prominent advocate for reading for pleasure at the national policy level. His campaign included:

- Direct engagement with education ministers and shadow ministers
- The BBC4 television programmes *Just Read* promoting reading for pleasure
- Contributions to Ofsted's development of reading for pleasure recommendations
- Ongoing commentary on education policy through his blog and media appearances

His 2014 Guardian article "Dear Ms Morgan: a reading policy isn't just telling grandparents what to do" exemplifies his critical engagement with policy, challenging superficial approaches that mandate reading for pleasure without addressing structural barriers or providing adequate resources.

### The Reading for Pleasure Guide

Rosen has produced a comprehensive guide to developing reading for pleasure policies in schools. This resource:

- Defines reading for pleasure and distinguishes it from reading for instruction
- Provides guidance on creating whole-school cultures that support reading
- Addresses practical considerations (book selection, time allocation, space design)
- Emphasises the importance of teacher knowledge and enthusiasm
- Stresses inclusive approaches that reach all pupils

The guide is designed to be adaptable, recognising that schools must develop approaches suited to their specific contexts and pupil populations.

## Pedagogical Approaches Derived from Rosen's Work

### Teaching Poetry Writing

Rosen's book *What is Poetry? The Essential Guide to Reading and Writing Poems* provides a structured approach to poetry education that balances creative freedom with technical understanding. The book:

- Explores the etymology of poetry (from Greek *poiéo*, meaning "I make or create")
- Introduces poetic techniques through accessible examples
- Provides writing tips and exercises suitable for classroom use
- Includes analyses of classic poems to develop appreciation
- Features an appendix of poets and useful websites

Teachers using this resource can structure poetry units that move between reading, performance, analysis, and creative writing in integrated ways.

### Developing Reading Communities

Rosen's work supports the development of classroom and school reading communities through:

**Book Talk**: Creating structured opportunities for children to discuss their reading with peers, sharing recommendations and responses.

**Reading Aloud**: Prioritising regular reading aloud by teachers, regardless of the age of pupils, to model expressive reading and introduce texts that might be beyond pupils' independent reading levels.

**Choice and Voice**: Respecting children's reading preferences while also gently expanding horizons through exposure to diverse texts.

### Performance Pedagogy

Rosen's performance-based approach to poetry has implications for speaking and listening as well as reading and writing:

- **Vocal development**: Using poetry to develop pupils' vocal range, projection, and expression
- **Memorisation**: Valuing the memorisation of poems as a route to ownership and understanding
- **Embodied learning**: Recognising that physical engagement with text supports comprehension and retention
- **Audience awareness**: Developing understanding of how performance affects audience reception

## Critical Reception and Academic Engagement

### Research Context

Rosen's advocacy for poetry-friendly classrooms connects with broader research on poetry education. A 2014 study published on ResearchGate, "Schools as 'Poetry-Friendly Places': Michael Rosen on Poetry in the Curriculum," identified concerns about:

- Limited potential for creative and aesthetic engagement in poetry classrooms
- Utilitarian approaches that prioritise exam performance over genuine engagement
- Marginalisation of pupil voice and subjective response
- The risk of poetry becoming "a packaged commodity"

The study argued for renewed teacher agency in developing poetry pedagogies that resist these pressures. Rosen's work provides practical resources and philosophical grounding for such resistance.

### Relationship to Educational Policy

Rosen maintains a critical relationship with educational policy, supporting initiatives that promote reading and creativity whilst challenging approaches he sees as counterproductive. His open letters to education secretaries (compiled in books such as *Good Ideas*) demonstrate his willingness to engage directly with policymakers whilst remaining accessible to classroom practitioners.

His advocacy contributed to Ofsted's explicit recommendation for reading for pleasure policies, though he has cautioned against superficial compliance that creates policies without changing practice.

## Classroom Applications

### For Early Years and Key Stage 1

Rosen's picture books, particularly *We're Going on a Bear Hunt*, are staples of early years classrooms. Applications include:

- **Repetitive text and participation**: Using the cumulative structure to encourage choral participation
- **Sound play**: Exploring onomatopoeia and sound patterns
- **Drama and movement**: Embodying the story through action
- **Story mapping**: Visualising the journey and sequence of events

### For Key Stage 2

At Key Stage 2, Rosen's poetry collections and performance approach support:

- **Developing reading fluency**: Through performance and rehearsal
- **Exploring voice**: Understanding how poets create distinctive voices
- **Writing workshop approaches**: Using Rosen's poems as models for pupils' own writing
- **Poetry recitation**: Building confidence through memorisation and performance

### For Key Stage 3

For older primary and secondary pupils, Rosen's educational texts and philosophy support:

- **Metacognitive approaches**: Reflecting on what poetry is and how it works
- **Critical appreciation**: Developing vocabulary for discussing poetic technique
- **Creative writing development**: Using structured approaches from *What is Poetry?*
- **Independent reading**: Promoting reading for pleasure across the transition to secondary school

## Implications for Teacher Development

### Subject Knowledge

Rosen's work supports teacher development in several dimensions:

**Poetry Knowledge**: Building teachers' confidence with poetry through accessible introductions to forms, techniques, and traditions.

**Performance Skills**: Encouraging teachers to develop their capacity for reading aloud and performing.

**Pedagogical Content Knowledge**: Understanding how to teach poetry in ways that maintain its affective and aesthetic qualities.

### Professional Values

Rosen's advocacy also speaks to teachers' professional values, supporting:

- **Resistance to instrumentalism**: Maintaining focus on intrinsic value despite pressure to prioritise measurable outcomes
- **Pupil-centred practice**: Keeping children's experiences and responses at the centre of pedagogical decisions
- **Intellectual independence**: Developing informed professional judgment rather than relying on packaged solutions

## Criticism and Controversy

Rosen's outspoken advocacy has generated occasional controversy. His critiques of phonics teaching, testing regimes, and curriculum narrowing have placed him in opposition to some government policies. Supporters see this as principled advocacy for children; critics sometimes characterise it as political opposition.

His approach to reading for pleasure has occasionally been caricatured as anti-phonics or anti-structured teaching, though Rosen himself has clarified that he supports phonics instruction as part of a balanced approach that includes attention to meaning, enjoyment, and choice.

## Legacy and Ongoing Influence

Michael Rosen's influence on English education in the UK is multifaceted:

**Literary Legacy**: His books continue to be read by millions of children, with *We're Going on a Bear Hunt* recognised as a modern classic.

**Pedagogical Legacy**: The Poetry Friendly Classroom concept has been adopted and adapted by schools across the country.

**Policy Legacy**: His advocacy contributed to the establishment of reading for pleasure as an explicit priority in Ofsted guidance.

**Professional Legacy**: Through his prolific output of blog posts, videos, and educational resources, Rosen has provided a model for teacher engagement and professional sharing.
