# Key Publications for English Subject Leaders

An essential reading list for English subject leaders, encompassing research journals, professional texts, practitioner handbooks, and organisational resources that support curriculum development, pedagogy, and leadership across all key stages.

## Academic Research Journals

### English in Education

*English in Education* stands as the premier academic research journal for the English teaching community in the United Kingdom. Published by the National Association for the Teaching of English (NATE) in partnership with Taylor & Francis, this peer-reviewed international journal has provided a forum for research and development in the learning and teaching of English for nearly six decades. The journal traces its lineage to John Dixon's seminal work *Growth through English* (1967), which presented a vision of the subject as a humane discipline for personal growth.

The journal publishes high-quality, original research alongside shorter creative pieces related to English education. Its archive charts the evolution of key concepts and practices in the teaching of English, making it an invaluable resource for subject leaders seeking to understand the historical development of current debates. Most issues discussed in contemporary English education are foreshadowed in the journal's extensive archive, offering subject leaders insight into how pedagogical approaches have emerged and transformed over time.

For subject leaders, *English in Education* provides evidence-based perspectives on curriculum design, assessment practices, and pedagogical innovation. University members typically access this journal through their institutional subscriptions, whilst NATE membership provides access to current and archived content. The journal's rigorous peer-review process ensures that published research meets high academic standards, making it a trusted source for informing strategic decisions about English provision.

### English Teaching: Practice and Critique

*English Teaching: Practice and Critique* (ETPC), published by Emerald, promotes research and scholarship related to language arts and literacy education across all ages and levels. This journal distinguishes itself through its critical perspective, requiring manuscripts to be grounded in critical theoretical frameworks. For subject leaders seeking to engage with research that questions established practices and offers alternative perspectives, ETPC provides a valuable counterpoint to more mainstream publications.

The journal's international scope means that subject leaders can access research from diverse educational contexts, offering opportunities to learn from practice in Australia, New Zealand, North America, and beyond. This global perspective is particularly valuable when considering how different educational systems approach challenges common to English teaching, such as developing writing proficiency, fostering reading engagement, and addressing linguistic diversity.

### ELT Journal

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Council, *ELT Journal* is a quarterly publication that has served the English language teaching community since 1946. Whilst its primary focus is on teaching English as a second or foreign language, the journal links everyday concerns of practitioners with insights from applied linguistics, offering relevant perspectives for subject leaders working in multilingual classrooms.

The journal's practical orientation, combined with its theoretical grounding, makes it accessible to busy subject leaders seeking research-informed strategies for classroom implementation. Articles often focus on specific pedagogical challenges, such as teaching grammar in context, developing academic writing skills, or integrating technology into language teaching. For subject leaders in schools with significant numbers of English as an Additional Language (EAL) learners, *ELT Journal* provides essential reading.

### British Educational Research Journal

The *British Educational Research Journal* (BERJ), published by BERA and Wiley, offers an interdisciplinary platform for educational research of the highest quality. Whilst not exclusively focused on English, BERJ publishes significant research on literacy, language, and English education that subject leaders should monitor. The journal's rigorous methodological standards and focus on research that addresses practical educational challenges make it a valuable resource for subject leaders seeking to ground their decisions in robust evidence.

## Professional Periodicals and Magazines

Drawing on extensive research evidence, Quigley identifies the factors that contribute to writing success and provides practical strategies for addressing the barriers that prevent pupils from achieving their potential.

For subject leaders, this text offers a research-informed framework for reviewing and developing writing provision. The book's focus on the relationships between reading and writing, the importance of vocabulary development, and the role of explicit instruction in writing development aligns with the findings of Ofsted's research review. Quigley's accessible writing style and classroom-focused examples make the research evidence actionable for busy teachers.

Geoff Barton, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders and former English teacher, describes the book as "a rich source of directions for further reading and examples of strategies for teaching writing which will support teachers to reflect on what happens in their writing classrooms and to make enabling changes."

### Teaching Primary English

Eve Bearne and David Reedy's *Teaching Primary English: Subject Knowledge and Classroom Practice* (Routledge) combines theoretical perspectives with practical suggestions to provide a comprehensive guide to teaching English in the primary classroom. The text addresses the subject knowledge that teachers require to teach English effectively, whilst offering practical strategies for translating that knowledge into classroom practice.

For subject leaders, this text provides a resource for auditing and developing subject knowledge across the teaching team. The integration of online materials extends the book's utility, providing subject leaders with resources for staff training and development. Suzanne Horton, Subject Leader for Primary English at the University of Worcester, describes the book as "a comprehensive guide to teaching English in the primary classroom which will inspire and enthuse teachers everywhere."

### Developing Poetry Skills

Geoff Barton's *Developing Poetry Skills: Reading Poetry 11-14* (Routledge) represents the extensive contribution that this leading English educator has made to the field. With over one hundred books on English and school leadership to his name, Barton's work has influenced generations of English teachers.

## Key Texts for Professional Development

### Foundational Texts

Certain texts have achieved foundational status in English education, shaping how generations of teachers have understood their subject. John Dixon's *Growth through English* (1967) established the personal growth model that influenced English teaching for decades. Whilst contemporary practice has moved beyond this model in many respects, understanding its influence remains important for subject leaders seeking to understand the history of their subject.

James Britton's *Language and Learning* (1970) and the work of the London School of English Studies have profoundly influenced understanding of how language development supports cognitive growth. Harold Rosen's writing on narrative and storytelling continues to inform approaches to teaching writing. For subject leaders, familiarity with these foundational texts provides intellectual context for contemporary debates.

### Contemporary Influences

More recent texts that have influenced English teaching include Doug Lemov's *Reading Reconsidered* and *Teach Like a Champion*, which have informed discussions about explicit instruction and close reading. Katie Ashford and Tom Bennett's work on classroom practice has influenced how English teachers approach behaviour management and academic rigour.

Caroline Oakley's work on assessment and moderation provides guidance for subject leaders navigating the complexities of GCSE and A Level examination requirements. The National Writing Project's publications continue to support the development of writing pedagogy.

## Organisational Resources

### British Council

The British Council's *TeachingEnglish* website provides extensive resources for English teachers, including research publications, lesson plans, and professional development materials. The council's *ELT Journal* and publications programme support teachers of English as a second or foreign language, whilst its wider resources on literature and language teaching are relevant to all English teachers.

For subject leaders in schools with international links or significant EAL populations, British Council resources provide valuable support for curriculum development and pedagogy.

### Literacy Hive

Literacy Hive serves as a directory and portal for literacy resources, providing subject leaders with curated access to materials from across the sector. Its coverage of organisations, publications, and resources saves subject leaders time in identifying relevant materials for specific purposes.

### The Reading Agency

The Reading Agency's resources support reading for pleasure and wider literacy development. Its programmes, such as the Summer Reading Challenge, provide opportunities for schools to engage families in supporting reading development. For subject leaders developing whole-school reading cultures, the agency's research and resources provide evidence-based guidance.

## Building a Subject Library

### Priorities for Collection Development

Subject leaders should priorities building collections that serve multiple purposes: supporting their own professional development, providing resources for colleagues, and informing curriculum development. A well-balanced subject library will include research journals, practical handbooks, subject knowledge texts, and resources related to specific curriculum areas.

For primary subject leaders, resources that support the teaching of early reading are essential given the significance of this area for pupil outcomes. Texts on systematic synthetic phonics, reading comprehension, and developing reading fluency should feature prominently.

For secondary subject leaders, resources that support the teaching of examination specifications are essential, given the accountability pressures affecting these key stages. However, subject leaders should also ensure that their collections include resources that support teaching beyond the examination requirements, fostering a broad and ambitious English curriculum.

### Digital Resources

Subject leaders should also develop collections of digital resources that complement print materials. NATE's digital archive, EMC's downloadable resources, and the DfE's guidance documents provide essential digital resources that can be accessed by multiple colleagues simultaneously.

### Sharing Resources

Effective subject leaders develop systems for sharing resources with colleagues, ensuring that investment in publications benefits the whole teaching team. This might include lending libraries, annotated bibliographies, or regular recommendations through staff bulletins or meetings.

## Conclusion

The publications outlined in this guide represent essential reading for English subject leaders seeking to develop their knowledge, skills, and effectiveness. From peer-reviewed academic journals to practical handbooks, from research reviews to classroom resources, these publications provide the intellectual foundations and practical guidance that subject leaders require.

The dynamic nature of English education means that subject leaders must commit to ongoing professional reading throughout their careers. The resources identified in this guide provide a foundation for that ongoing development, supporting subject leaders in their crucial role of ensuring that all pupils receive a high-quality English education.

Building and maintaining familiarity with these publications requires sustained effort, but the investment yields significant returns in terms of professional effectiveness and pupil outcomes. Subject leaders who engage regularly with professional literature are better equipped to make informed decisions, support their colleagues effectively, and navigate the complexities of curriculum leadership in an ever-changing educational landscape.

The organisations responsible for these publications—NATE, EMC, the British Council, and others—continue to evolve their offerings in response to changing educational contexts. Subject leaders should maintain regular contact with these organisations, attending conferences, participating in professional networks, and keeping abreast of new publications as they appear. Professional associations offer not only resources but also communities of practice that sustain subject leaders through the challenges of their role.
