# The English and Media Centre (EMC)

## Overview and Mission

The English and Media Centre (EMC) is an independent educational charity based in London, with a national and international reputation as a Centre of Excellence for secondary and further education English and Media teaching. Founded in 1990 as an independent educational charity, the EMC serves as a development centre supporting the needs of teachers and students of English and Media Studies throughout the United Kingdom.

The EMC's mission centres on supporting English and Media teachers through high-quality publications and classroom resources, online and in-person continuing professional development (CPD), student magazines, and research-based advocacy for the teaching of English. As a not-for-profit trust, the organisation reinvests all proceeds into developing new resources and maintaining its charitable educational objectives.

The Centre operates from Kentish Town in North London, offering face-to-face courses, consultancy, and a substantial catalogue of print and digital publications. The organisation has established itself as one of the most respected independent voices in English education, with particular strengths in curriculum development, pedagogical innovation, and supporting teachers in implementing engaging, challenging practice in their classrooms.

## History and Development

The EMC traces its origins to the educational landscape of the 1980s, when English teaching in London was significantly influenced by progressive educational movements and the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA). During the early 1980s, the ILEA established initiatives examining student achievement from the perspectives of class, race, and gender, asking English teachers across London to contribute to discussions about practice improvement. This period of reflective, collaborative professional development helped establish the intellectual foundations that would later inform the EMC's approach.

The organisation emerged as an independent educational charity in 1990, positioning itself as a development centre rather than simply a resource provider. This distinction matters significantly: the EMC has consistently viewed its role as supporting teacher development and professional learning, not merely producing materials for classroom consumption. The Centre's early work established patterns that continue today—close collaboration with practising teachers, research-informed resource development, and advocacy for English teaching as a intellectually demanding and creative profession.

Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, the EMC expanded its publication programme, developed its CPD offerings, and established itself as a significant voice in national debates about English teaching. The organisation has consistently maintained its independence from government, examination boards, and commercial publishers, allowing it to offer critical perspectives on policy developments whilst maintaining practical focus on supporting classroom practice.

## Core Publications and Resources

The EMC's publication programme represents one of the most comprehensive collections of English teaching materials available to UK schools. Publications span Key Stage 3 (ages 11-14), Key Stage 4/GCSE (ages 14-16), and A Level (ages 16-18), with particular strengths in literature study, language exploration, and media education.

### Full Text Study Editions

One of the EMC's signature publication types is the full text study edition, designed to support students reading set texts for GCSE and A Level examinations. These editions contain the complete text of the literary work, divided into manageable sections with accompanying activities designed to deepen understanding and develop analytical skills.

Study editions available include major GCSE and A Level set texts:
- **Jane Eyre** (Charlotte Brontë)
- **Frankenstein** (Mary Shelley)
- **Great Expectations** (Charles Dickens)
- **A Christmas Carol** (Charles Dickens)
- **Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde** (R.L. Stevenson)
- **Animal Farm** (George Orwell)
- **An Inspector Calls** (J.B. Priestley) – included in the anthology "An Inspector Called and Other Stories"

Each study edition provides not merely the text but dozens of activities to supplement and develop students' knowledge and understanding. The activities are designed for classroom use or to support students reading independently, with particular attention to developing close reading skills, contextual understanding, and analytical writing.

### KS3 Anthologies and Pupil Books

The EMC has developed an extensive range of anthologies specifically designed for Key Stage 3, recognising the importance of establishing strong foundations before students encounter GCSE requirements.

**Poetry Plus for KS3** offers an eclectic mix of poems designed to intrigue and engage students whilst providing an excellent foundation for GCSE study. The anthology moves beyond narrow conceptions of "suitable" poems for this age group, introducing students to diverse voices, forms, and poetic traditions. Activities accompanying the poems focus on developing enjoyment alongside analytical capability.

**Diverse Shorts** is an anthology of stories and extracts from novels, designed to promote critical thinking through engaging, challenging texts. The anthology represents diverse voices and perspectives, supporting teachers in developing an inclusive curriculum whilst maintaining high expectations for all students.

**Literary Shorts** provides another collection of short stories for KS3, accompanied by teaching activities. The anthology introduces students to significant literary voices and develops their capacity for close, attentive reading of complete texts.

**Iridescent Adolescent** offers diverse literary short stories specifically selected to engage adolescent readers whilst developing their analytical capabilities. The anthology reflects contemporary developments in young adult literature whilst maintaining literary quality and challenge.

## Key Personnel

The EMC is directed by a small team of experienced educators who combine practical teaching experience with extensive work in resource development and professional learning.

### Barbara Bleiman

Barbara Bleiman has worked in education for over 40 years as a teacher and expert on secondary English. As an education consultant at the EMC, she leads CPD courses, writes publications for the classroom, blogs extensively, and speaks at conferences and events across the country.

Bleiman takes the lead on EMC's project on group work, "It's Good to Talk," and has a strong interest in ideas about the curriculum. She has developed the concept of "cultural conversations" as a challenge to narrower conceptions of cultural capital, arguing for approaches that engage students with meaningful cultural dialogue rather than simply transmitting cultural knowledge.

In 2019, Bleiman was awarded the NATE Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Teaching of English. She is also a Fellow of the English Association. Her book **What Matters in English Teaching** (2020), published by the EMC, collects together her blogs, speeches, and other writings from the early 1990s to the present day, offering a sustained reflection on English teaching and curriculum over three decades.

Bleiman has also published fiction, including two novels (*Off the Voortrekker Road* and *Accidents of Love*) and a collection of short stories (*Kremlinology of Kisses*).

### Lucy Webster

Lucy Webster has been an advisory teacher at the EMC since 1999. She is co-editor of emagazine, runs courses, and writes and edits publications, specialising in A Level English Literature. Her work focuses particularly on supporting students in the transition to advanced literary study and developing materials that bridge the gap between school and university approaches to literature.

### Claire Pollard

Claire Pollard edits MediaMagazine and works on media education resources and courses. Her role connects the Centre's work with the Goldsmiths Media with English PGCE programme, ensuring EMC media resources reflect current developments in teacher education and academic media studies.

### Jenny Grahame

Jenny Grahame contributes to the Centre's work on media education and has collaborated on publications including *English Allsorts: The EMC Collection of Ideas for English and Media Classrooms*.

## Pedagogical Approach and Influence

The EMC has developed a distinctive pedagogical approach that has influenced English teaching across the UK. Key characteristics include:

### Group Work and Dialogic Learning

Through projects such as "It's Good to Talk," the EMC has consistently advocated for the importance of talk and collaborative learning in English. Barbara Bleiman's work on group reading demonstrates how carefully structured group work can transform the study of class novels, creating conditions where students engage more deeply with texts and with each other's interpretations.

The Centre's approach to group work is not merely organisational but pedagogical—concerned with how collaborative structures can enhance literary understanding, develop critical thinking, and support students in becoming more independent readers.

### Substantive Curriculum Content

The EMC has been a consistent advocate for "curriculum substance"—the idea that English teaching should be grounded in rich, challenging content rather than reduced to skills practice or examination preparation. The Centre's KS3 Curriculum Package exemplifies this approach, combining EMC publications with guidance on creating a coherent, content-rich curriculum for the 11-14 age range.

This emphasis on substance connects with Bleiman's concept of "cultural conversations"—the idea that students should be engaged in meaningful dialogue with significant cultural texts and ideas, rather than simply acquiring predetermined cultural knowledge.

### Challenging All Students

EMC resources consistently reflect high expectations for all students, rejecting deficit models that lower ambitions for particular groups. Anthologies such as *Diverse Shorts* and *Iridescent Adolescent* demonstrate how diverse representation can be combined with intellectual challenge, offering students texts that both reflect their experiences and extend their horizons.

### Responsive Pedagogy

The Centre emphasises what Bleiman terms "responsive pedagogy"—teaching that responds to students' ideas, questions, and responses rather than following predetermined scripts. This approach requires teachers to maintain clear purposes and high expectations whilst remaining flexible in how they achieve these goals, adjusting teaching in light of ongoing assessment of student understanding.

## Research and Policy Engagement

Beyond resource development and CPD, the EMC engages with research and policy debates affecting English teaching:

### The It's Good to Talk Project

This ongoing research project investigates the role of group work in English teaching, exploring how collaborative approaches can enhance student engagement and learning. The project produces practical guidance for teachers alongside more theoretical reflections on the nature of classroom talk and its relationship to literary understanding.

### Assessment Research

The EMC has conducted in-depth assessment project work, examining principles and practices for assessing English. This research informs both the Centre's courses and its advocacy for assessment approaches that support learning rather than distorting teaching.

### Policy Commentary

Through Barbara Bleiman's blog and other channels, the EMC contributes to national debates about English teaching, curriculum, and assessment. The Centre has been particularly vocal in critiques of narrow conceptions of cultural capital, reductionist approaches to reading, and curriculum changes that threaten the integrity of English as a subject.

## Awards and Recognition

The EMC's work has received significant recognition:

- **Education Show Resources Award 2002**: Winner of Best Secondary Resource for the 'EMC KS3 English Series'
- **NATE Award 2019**: Barbara Bleiman received the National Association for the Teaching of English Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Teaching of English
- **English Association Fellowship**: Recognition of Bleiman's contribution to English education

## Practical Applications for Teachers

### Using EMC Resources in Curriculum Planning

Teachers can draw on EMC resources at different levels of curriculum planning:

**Unit planning**: EMC anthologies and study editions provide ready-structured units that can be incorporated into schemes of work. The activities accompanying texts offer models for engaging students with literature that can be adapted for other texts.

**Lesson resources**: Individual activities from EMC publications can be integrated into existing schemes, providing high-quality materials that develop specific skills or understandings.

**Professional learning**: EMC courses and publications support teacher development, helping educators refresh their subject knowledge and develop new pedagogical approaches.

- Support independent study and wider reading requirements
- Bridge the gap between school and university study

## Conclusion
