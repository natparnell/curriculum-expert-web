# NATE: National Association for the Teaching of English

## Overview

The National Association for the Teaching of English (NATE) is the United Kingdom's leading professional subject association for educators involved in teaching English from Early Years through to University level. Established in 1963, NATE has served for over six decades as the primary voice for English teachers, providing a forum for the development of modern approaches to English teaching, supporting professional development, and advocating for the importance of English education at national policy level.

NATE operates as an educational charity, governed by a board of Trustees and led by a Director, with support from volunteers including working teachers, academics, and consultants. The association represents English teachers across the four countries of the United Kingdom—England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland—and maintains international connections through its membership of the International Federation for the Teaching of English (IFTE).

## Historical Development

### Origins and Foundation (1963)

NATE was established in 1963 during a period of significant educational reform in the United Kingdom. The association emerged from a growing recognition that English teachers needed a dedicated professional body to share innovative practices, develop subject-specific expertise, and advocate for the distinctive nature of English as a curriculum subject. The post-war period had seen rapid changes in educational policy, including the move toward comprehensive education and the emergence of new theories about language and learning that demanded subject-specific professional development and collegial support.

### The Growth of English in Education (1967)

In 1967, NATE launched its flagship academic journal, *English in Education*, which has since become one of the most respected research publications in the field of English teaching. The journal was established to provide a forum for research and development in the learning and teaching of English, bridging the gap between academic research and classroom practice. Its first publication marked NATE's commitment to evidence-based approaches to English teaching and its recognition that teachers needed access to current research to inform their practice.

### Evolution Through Educational Reform

Throughout its history, NATE has navigated numerous periods of educational change, including the introduction of the National Curriculum in 1988, the National Literacy Strategy in the late 1990s, successive revisions to GCSE and A Level specifications, and the more recent curriculum debates about knowledge-rich approaches versus progressive pedagogies. Throughout these changes, NATE has maintained its position as an independent voice for the profession, neither simply opposing government policy nor uncritically accepting reforms, but rather providing critical analysis and practical guidance to support teachers in implementing changes effectively.

## English in Education: The Research Journal

### Publication History and Format

*English in Education* is NATE's international, peer-reviewed academic research journal, first published in 1967 and now approaching six decades of continuous publication. The journal is published by Routledge/Taylor & Francis on behalf of NATE and appears quarterly, providing a regular forum for high-quality research and scholarly discussion related to English education.

The journal has evolved significantly in its format and accessibility. Originally available only in print, *English in Education* is now available to NATE members in a fully digital format, though print editions can still be purchased directly from the publisher. This digital availability has significantly expanded access to research for classroom teachers who may not have institutional library subscriptions.

### Editorial Scope and Aims

*English in Education* publishes research-based articles, reviews, and creative pieces that reflect on every aspect of English teaching. The journal's scope encompasses:

- Empirical research studies investigating aspects of English teaching and learning
- Theoretical articles exploring conceptual frameworks for understanding English education
- Reviews of policy developments and their implications for practice
- Critical analyses of curriculum materials and assessment approaches
- Reflective pieces from practitioners examining their own classroom practice
- Book reviews and reviews of digital resources
- Creative writing related to English teaching and learning

The journal maintains an explicit commitment to bridging research and practice. Unlike purely academic journals that may prioritise theoretical sophistication over accessibility, *English in Education* seeks to publish work that speaks to both researchers and practitioners, recognising that the most valuable research in education is that which ultimately informs and improves classroom practice.

### Peer Review and Academic Standards

As a peer-reviewed journal, *English in Education* maintains rigorous academic standards while remaining accessible to practitioner-readers. The peer review process involves evaluation by experts in the field who assess submissions for their contribution to knowledge, methodological rigour, clarity of argument, and relevance to English teaching. This process ensures that published articles meet high standards of scholarly integrity while remaining grounded in the realities of classroom practice.

The journal's international editorial board brings together leading researchers and experienced practitioners from across the English-speaking world, ensuring diverse perspectives and maintaining the journal's international relevance while keeping its primary focus on UK contexts.

### Notable Contributors and Themes

Over its nearly sixty-year history, *English in Education* has published work by many of the most influential figures in English education. The journal's archive charts the evolution of key concepts and practices in English teaching, from early debates about language and literature to contemporary discussions about multiliteracies, digital texts, and critical literacy.

The fiftieth anniversary of NATE in 2013 was marked by a special issue of *English in Education* (Volume 48, Issue 3) that reflected on five decades of the association's work and the journal's contribution to shaping the field. This anniversary issue, edited by Sue Dymoke of the University of Leicester, brought together retrospective analyses and forward-looking perspectives that demonstrated both how far English education has come and the continuing relevance of NATE's founding mission.

Beyond its practical benefits, NATE membership supports the professional identity of English teachers. In an educational landscape that can sometimes feel dominated by generic approaches to teaching and learning, NATE affirms the distinctive nature of English as a subject and the specialised expertise of English teachers. The association provides a professional home where English teachers can connect with colleagues who share their subject passion and pedagogical commitments.

## Contemporary Challenges and Future Directions

### Current Context for English Teaching

English teachers in the UK currently face significant challenges that NATE is working to address:

**Curriculum Pressures:** The tension between prescribed curriculum content and teachers' professional judgment about what will best serve their students' learning.

**Assessment Demands:** High-stakes testing and examination pressures that can narrow the curriculum and limit the scope for creative, exploratory approaches to English.

**Workload Issues:** Heavy marking loads, particularly for examination classes, that can detract from the planning and preparation that support effective teaching.

**Literacy Concerns:** Ongoing challenges related to literacy attainment, particularly for disadvantaged students, and the pressure this places on English departments.

**Post-16 Uptake:** Declining uptake of English subjects at A Level in some contexts, raising questions about how the subject is presented to students and its perceived value.

### NATE's Strategic Response

NATE's current strategic direction responds to these challenges through several key priorities:

**Strengthening Membership:** Building a stronger, more diverse membership base to ensure the association can continue its representational and developmental work.

**Enhancing Digital Provision:** Developing online resources and communities that make NATE's support more accessible to teachers across the country.

**Research Engagement:** Continuing to publish high-quality research in *English in Education* while finding new ways to make research accessible and relevant to practitioners.
