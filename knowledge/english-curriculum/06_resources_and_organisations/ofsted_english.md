## The Curriculum Research Review Series: English (2022)

### Purpose and Scope

Published in May 2022 and updated in July 2022, Ofsted's Curriculum Research Review Series: English represents a comprehensive synthesis of research literature relating to English education. Its purpose is to "identify factors that can contribute to high-quality curriculums, pedagogy, assessment and schools' systems for managing the subject."

The review draws upon cognitive science, educational research, and subject-specific scholarship to establish an evidence base for effective English teaching. While not prescribing a single approach, it outlines principles that characterise high-quality provision across the primary and secondary phases.

### National Context and Baseline Data

The review establishes a concerning baseline for English achievement in England:

- Just under three-quarters of five-year-olds met the expected level of development across all Early Learning Goals for communication, language and literacy
- 30% of disadvantaged pupils in Year 1 cannot decode at the minimum standard required
- More than 25% of 11-year-olds did not reach age-related expectations in reading (2019 data)
- 3 out of 10 pupils did not gain a standard pass in English Language at GCSE
- The number of pupils taking A-level English has declined over the past decade
- Girls consistently outperform boys in national assessments
- Pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds achieve significantly less well than their peers

These statistics underscore the review's emphasis on foundational knowledge, particularly for disadvantaged learners and those with lower starting points.

### Conceptualising English as a Knowledge-Rich Subject

A central thesis of the research review is that English should be understood as a body of knowledge rather than purely a skills-based subject. The review defines knowledge as "the concepts, facts, processes, language, narratives and conventions of each subject."

This knowledge encompasses:

**Language Knowledge**
- Vocabulary (breadth and depth)
- Grammar and syntax
- Genre conventions
- Rhetorical devices
- Linguistic patterns

**Literary Knowledge**
- Narrative structures and archetypes
- Poetic forms and devices
- Literary periods and movements
- Authorial craft and intention
- Intertextual connections

**Disciplinary Knowledge**
- How to read as a literary critic
- How to write for different purposes and audiences
- How to craft and present spoken language
- Methods of analysis and interpretation

### Foundational Knowledge: The Early Years and Key Stage 1

The review places significant emphasis on early development, recognising that gaps established in EYFS and Key Stage 1 become increasingly difficult to address later.

#### Spoken Language Development

Ofsted's review highlights that children with a language deficit at age 5 are four times more likely to have difficulties with reading when they are adults. Developing spoken language—including vocabulary—is essential for the academic progress of all children, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Key principles include:
- Explicit vocabulary instruction is critically important, particularly in the early years
- Reducing the word gap in EYFS and KS1 can help disadvantaged children develop vocabulary faster
- Rich oral language experiences form the foundation for reading comprehension and writing

#### The Simple View of Reading

The National Curriculum reflects the Simple View of Reading (Gough and Tunmer), comprising two essential components:

1. **Word Recognition** – The ability to decode written words
2. **Language Comprehension** – Understanding the meaning of language

These components form the basis for programmes of study in KS1 and KS2.

#### Writing: Transcription and Composition

Similarly, writing is understood in terms of:

1. **Transcription** – Spelling and handwriting
2. **Composition** – Structuring and articulating ideas

Children should begin learning to read and write words in Reception as part of phonics teaching. Decoding and transcription should remain a priority in KS1 and beyond for pupils who have not mastered these foundational skills.

#### The Case for Systematic Synthetic Phonics

The review presents a strong evidence base for systematic synthetic phonics (SSP), noting:

- A significant American study found phonics teaching is more effective when introduced early, particularly before age 6
- Daily systematic phonics instruction leads to a quicker start in early reading and spelling
- Cognitive neuroscience findings suggest early phonics teaching primes children's minds to learn to read
- Systematic synthetic phonics and direct instruction are particularly effective approaches

## Subject Report: Telling the Story (March 2024)

### Methodology and Sample

Published in March 2024, "Telling the Story: The English Education Subject Report" represents Ofsted's evaluation of how English is actually being taught in schools. The report draws upon visits to 25 primary schools and 25 secondary schools across England.

### Key Finding 1: Marked Improvement in Reading Instruction

Ofsted found that "the teaching of reading has improved markedly" since previous evaluations. Schools prioritise reading, ensure the curriculum develops this skill, and have invested significantly in phonics programmes and training.

**Effective Practice Identified:**
- Systematic synthetic phonics programmes are widely implemented
- Daily phonics teaching is commonplace
- Decodable books are used appropriately
- Phonics training for teachers is prioritised

**Areas for Continued Development:**
- Schools are "less clear about how to build fluency and comprehension" once pupils read accurately
- Some secondary schools do not do enough to help weaker readers catch up
- Continued development of reading fluency varies across schools

**Recommendations:**
- Schools should encourage pupils to read a wide range of books once fluent, to establish reading as a habit
- More should be done to help pupils who enter KS2 or KS3 unable to read fluently catch up quickly

### Key Finding 2: The Writing Curriculum is Less Effective

In contrast to reading, Ofsted found that "the curriculum for writing and spoken language is less effective."

**Issues Identified in Primary Schools:**

- Pupils are "not given enough teaching and practice to become fluent with transcription early enough"
- Grammar, sentence structure, and punctuation are taught explicitly but pupils "do not always get enough practice to secure this knowledge"
- Most primaries do not give pupils "enough teaching and practice to gain high degrees of fluency in spelling and handwriting"
- Pupils are "expected to carry out extended writing tasks before they have the required knowledge and skills"
- "It is not uncommon to see the same inaccuracies repeated in books, including the basics, such as capital letters and full stops"

**Issues Identified in Secondary Schools:**

- Schools are "often unsure how to help pupils who arrive at secondary school unable to read and write fluently"
- "Activities given to pupils mask, rather than address, skills they need to improve and practise"
- Gap-fill exercises and similar tasks may hide underlying difficulties rather than addressing them

**Recommendations:**
- Explicit teaching of grammar must be followed by sufficient practice
- Oral composition should be used more frequently to practise writing skills
- Dictation should be used to develop transcription skills
- Extended writing should only be expected when foundational skills are secure

### Key Finding 3: Spoken Language Neglected

Ofsted found that "schools often do not consider spoken language well in their English curriculum."

**Key Issues:**

- Schools are "not always clear about how to teach the conventions of spoken language that enable pupils to speak competently in a range of contexts"
- Teachers often attribute pupils' speaking weaknesses to "a lack of confidence" rather than recognising insufficient teaching
- It is "rare for schools to follow a curriculum which develops pupils' spoken language"

**Recommendations:**
- Schools should "make sure the national curriculum requirements for spoken language are translated into practice"
- Pupils should learn "how to present, to debate and to explain their thinking"
- Debating should be encouraged to boost pupils' oracy

### Key Finding 4: English Not Always Valued as a Subject in Its Own Right

Ofsted found that English is "not always seen as a valued subject in its own right" and that schools "sometimes focus on its supporting role."

**Manifestations of This Issue:**

- Primary schools "too often" choose texts based on their link to other curriculum areas "rather than on how they might advance pupils' knowledge of English language and understanding of literature"
- Despite allocating "significant time to the subject", this time is "not always used productively"
- In some schools, "most commonly in key stage 1", pupils carry out "time-filling activities that lack purpose"

**Recommendations:**
- Primary schools should choose texts "first and foremost on literary merit"
- Activities should have clear purposes linked to curriculum progression

### Key Finding 5: External Assessments Distort the Curriculum

A persistent finding across both primary and secondary phases is that "external assessments unhelpfully shape the curriculum."

**Evidence of Distortion:**

- Schools "expect pupils to repeatedly attempt complex tasks that replicate national curriculum tests and exams"
- This comes "at the expense of first making sure that pupils are taught, and securely know, the underlying knowledge they need"
- "Completing national curriculum test and exam-style questions is the main, extremely limited, method of improving pupils' reading fluency and comprehension"
- At KS3, schools often encourage "excessive practice of a narrow range of writing structures to prepare pupils for GCSEs"

**Recommendations:**
- Schools should "ensure that statutory tests and exams do not disproportionately influence decisions about curriculum and pedagogy"
- Reading curriculum should not be limited to responding to exam-style questions

### Key Finding 6: Professional Development Gaps

The report identifies significant gaps in teachers' professional development:

- Some teachers have "a disjointed and narrow understanding of the subject"
- CPD focuses "mainly on assessment and moderation practices"
- "Beyond phonics, there is little training for primary teachers to build their professional knowledge about English literature and language"

**Recommendations:**
- Schools should "ensure teachers have high-quality professional development in English literature and language"
- Teachers need time to "develop subject knowledge beyond exam specifications"

## Deep Dive Methodology for English

### Purpose of Deep Dives

According to the Education Inspection Framework (EIF), the purpose of a deep dive is to "establish a coherent evidence base on the quality of education." Multiple deep dives enable inspectors to build a connected sample of lessons, work scrutiny, and discussions that reveal the true quality of the curriculum.

**Note:** From September 2024, Ofsted removed deep dives from ungraded inspections. They remain a feature of graded inspections.

### The Deep Dive Process

#### 1. Pre-Inspection Preparation

Before arriving, inspectors review:
- Published performance data (SATs, GCSE, A-level results)
- Progress measures for different groups (disadvantaged, SEND, EAL)
- Previous inspection reports
- The school's own curriculum documentation

#### 2. Initial Conversation with Subject Leaders

Inspectors typically begin with a detailed discussion covering:

**Curriculum Intent:**
- What is the purpose of your English curriculum?
- How does it align with the National Curriculum and the school's context?
- What do you want pupils to know and be able to do by the end of each key stage?

**Curriculum Implementation:**
- How is the curriculum sequenced and why?
- What pedagogical approaches do you expect teachers to use?
- How do you ensure consistency across classes and teachers?
- How is reading taught, including phonics, fluency, and comprehension?

**Curriculum Impact:**
- How do you know the curriculum is effective?
- What assessment systems are in place?
- How do you identify and address gaps?

#### 3. Lesson Observations

Inspectors observe a sample of English lessons across different year groups and teachers. They are not grading individual lessons but looking for:

- Whether the taught content aligns with the stated curriculum
- How teachers present new knowledge
- Whether pupils are building on prior learning
- How teachers check for understanding
- The quality of classroom talk and discussion

**Key Focus Areas for English:**
- Phonics teaching in EYFS/KS1 (if applicable)
- Reading fluency and comprehension strategies
- Writing instruction and practice opportunities
- Grammar and vocabulary teaching
- Spoken language development

#### 4. Work Scrutiny

Inspectors review pupils' books, typically sampling different ability groups, year groups, and pupils with SEND or who are disadvantaged.

They look for:
- Whether work shows curriculum progression
- Quality and quantity of writing
- Evidence of editing and redrafting
- Spelling accuracy and handwriting development
- Teacher feedback and pupil response

#### 5. Pupil Voice

Inspectors speak with pupils to understand:
- What they are learning and why
- What they have learned previously that connects to current work
- How they have improved over time
- Whether they read for pleasure

#### 6. Follow-Up Discussions

Inspectors may return to subject leaders to clarify observations and verify claims made in initial discussions.

### Typical Deep Dive Questions for English

**Curriculum Design:**
- Tell me about your curriculum vision for English. What are you trying to achieve?
- How is your curriculum sequenced? Can you show me how knowledge builds over time?
- How do you ensure progression in reading from phonics through to critical analysis?
- How does writing progress from transcription to sophisticated composition?

**Pedagogy:**
- What pedagogical principles underpin your English teaching?
- How do you balance explicit instruction with independent application?
- How do teachers model writing and metacognitive strategies?
- What does effective vocabulary instruction look like in your school?

**Assessment:**
- How do you assess reading fluency and comprehension?
- How do you identify pupils who need additional support?
- What diagnostic assessments do you use?
- How does assessment inform curriculum planning?

**Specific to English:**
- How do you support pupils who arrive in Year 7 unable to read fluently?
- What is your school's approach to teaching writing?
- How do you choose the texts pupils study?
- How do you develop pupils' spoken language skills?
- What are you doing to close the gap for disadvantaged pupils in English?

## Common Weaknesses in English Inspections

Ofsted's subject report identifies recurring weaknesses that schools should address:

### Reading
- **Fluency gaps:** Insufficient attention to developing reading fluency once pupils can decode
- **Comprehension strategies:** Over-reliance on test-style questions rather than developing genuine understanding
- **Secondary catch-up:** Weak provision for pupils who enter KS3 unable to read fluently

### Writing
- **Transcription weaknesses:** Poor spelling and handwriting that hinders composition
- **Insufficient practice:** Grammar taught explicitly but not practised enough to become secure
- **Premature extended writing:** Expecting extended writing before foundational skills are secure
- **Lack of revisiting:** Fundamental errors persisting because they are not systematically addressed

### Spoken Language
- **Curriculum absence:** Spoken language not planned or taught systematically
- **Confidence mistaken for competence:** Assuming pupils can speak well rather than teaching them how
- **Limited range:** Few opportunities for presentation, debate, or formal discussion

### Curriculum Design
- **Text selection:** Choosing texts for topic links rather than literary merit
- **Assessment distortion:** Curriculum narrowed by excessive focus on test and exam preparation
- **Time-filling activities:** Low-value activities that do not advance pupils' knowledge

### Leadership and Professional Development
- **Narrow CPD:** Training focused on assessment and moderation rather than subject knowledge
- **Disjointed understanding:** Teachers lacking coherent knowledge of English literature and language
- **Weak diagnostics:** Assessment not used effectively to identify specific gaps

## Implications for Curriculum Planning

### Principle 1: Prioritise Foundational Knowledge

Ofsted's evidence is clear: gaps in foundational knowledge become harder to address over time. Curriculum planning should:

- Ensure phonics is taught systematically and effectively in EYFS and KS1
- Provide sufficient practice for transcription skills to become automatic
- Address language deficits early, particularly for disadvantaged
---

## Implications for Curriculum Planning and Professional Development

### Principle 1: Prioritise Foundational Knowledge

Ofsted's evidence is clear: gaps in foundational knowledge become exponentially harder to address over time. Curriculum planning must ensure:

**Early Years and Key Stage 1:**
- Daily, systematic phonics instruction using validated programmes
- Explicit vocabulary teaching that addresses the word gap
- Rich spoken language experiences that build comprehension
- Sufficient practice for transcription skills (handwriting, spelling)

**Key Stage 2:**
- Continued support for pupils who have not mastered phonics
- Systematic development of reading fluency
- Explicit grammar instruction with abundant practice opportunities
- Careful sequencing from transcription to composition

**Key Stage 3:**
- Diagnostic assessment on entry to identify reading and writing gaps
- Targeted intervention for pupils below expected standards
- Curriculum that secures foundational knowledge before GCSE preparation
- Explicit teaching of academic vocabulary and disciplinary conventions

### Principle 2: Secure Knowledge Before Independent Application

Both the research review and subject report emphasise that pupils need secure knowledge before they can apply it effectively. This has implications for:

**Lesson Design:**
- Explicit teaching of new concepts before expecting independent use
- Guided practice with scaffolded support
- Gradual removal of scaffolding as pupils develop fluency
- Independent application only when knowledge is secure

**Extended Writing:**
- Ensure transcription skills are automatic before demanding extended composition
- Use oral composition and sentence-level practice to build competence
- Provide sufficient practice at each stage before progressing

### Principle 3: Value English as a Subject in Its Own Right

The finding that English is "not always seen as a valued subject in its own right" should prompt reflection on:

**Text Selection:**
- Choose texts primarily for their literary merit and capacity to advance pupils' English knowledge
- Avoid selecting texts solely because they link to topics in other subjects
- Ensure a diverse, challenging, and engaging range of literature

**Activity Design:**
- Ensure every activity has a clear purpose linked to curriculum progression
- Eliminate time-filling activities that do not advance knowledge
- Design tasks that require pupils to think about English as a discipline

### Principle 4: Resist Assessment Distortion

The subject report's finding that external assessments "unhelpfully shape the curriculum" is a significant concern. Schools should:

**Maintain Curriculum Integrity:**
- Ensure the curriculum determines assessment, not vice versa
- Avoid excessive practice of exam-style questions at the expense of knowledge development
- Teach the full curriculum at Key Stage 3 rather than prematurely focusing on GCSE preparation

**Develop Balanced Assessment:**
- Use a range of assessment approaches, not just test-style questions
- Assess reading fluency and comprehension directly, not only through written responses
- Evaluate writing across a range of purposes and forms

### Principle 5: Develop Teachers' Subject Knowledge

The finding that CPD focuses "mainly on assessment and moderation practices" suggests a need for:

**Subject-Specific Training:**
- Professional development in English literature and language, beyond phonics
- Deep exploration of disciplinary knowledge and how to teach it
- Engagement with current research and scholarship in English education

**Collaborative Planning:**
- Opportunities for teachers to develop shared understanding of curriculum content
- Subject leader expertise to guide pedagogical decisions
- Access to high-quality resources that support teacher knowledge

## Critical Perspectives and Debates

While Ofsted's research review and subject report represent influential documents, they have generated significant debate within the English teaching community. Understanding these debates is important for subject leaders navigating curriculum decisions.

### The Knowledge-Rich Curriculum

Ofsted's framing of English as a "knowledge-rich" subject has been broadly welcomed by many who argue that English had become overly focused on process at the expense of content. However, critics note:

- The definition of "knowledge" in English remains contested—is it primarily literary, linguistic, or cultural?
- There is a risk of narrowing the subject to easily assessable content
- The affective and experiential dimensions of English (pleasure, response, creativity) may be undervalued

### The Emphasis on Systematic Synthetic Phonics

While the evidence for systematic phonics is strong, some educators argue:

- Phonics is necessary but not sufficient for reading development
- A rigid adherence to phonics-first approaches may disadvantage some learners
- Reading for pleasure and comprehension development should receive equal emphasis

### The Role of Dialogic Pedagogy

The research review acknowledges dialogic talk while emphasising explicit instruction. Some commentators suggest these approaches are more complementary than the review suggests, with high-quality dialogue being a means of explicit knowledge construction.

### Assessment and Accountability

The subject report's finding that external assessments distort the curriculum points to a systemic issue. Critics argue that Ofsted's own framework and the broader accountability system contribute to this distortion, and that individual schools can only partially resist these pressures.
