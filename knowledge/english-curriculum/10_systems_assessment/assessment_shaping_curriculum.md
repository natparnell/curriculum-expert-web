# Assessment Shaping Curriculum: Exam Preparation versus Knowledge Building

## Introduction: The Curriculum-Assessment Tension

The relationship between curriculum and assessment in English education represents one of the most persistent and problematic tensions in contemporary schooling. As Ofsted's 2024 English Subject Report starkly observed, schools frequently "expect pupils to repeatedly attempt complex tasks that replicate national curriculum tests and exams," often at "the expense of first making sure that pupils are taught, and securely know, the underlying knowledge they need." This phenomenon—where assessment drives curriculum rather than serving it—has profound implications for the quality of English education across all key stages.

This knowledge file examines how assessment shapes curriculum in English, exploring the dangers of premature exam replication, the distinction between formative and summative purposes, and the principles that can guide assessment design to support rather than distort curriculum integrity. Drawing on research from Ofsted, subject associations, curriculum theorists such as Christine Counsell, and assessment specialists including Dylan Wiliam, it offers a framework for principled assessment that preserves the dignity and coherence of English as a subject.

## The Problem: When Assessment Distorts Curriculum

### Understanding the Backwash Effect

The "backwash effect" (sometimes termed "washback") describes the influence of testing on teaching and learning. Arthur Hughes, writing in 1989, defined backwash as "the effect of tests on teaching and learning," noting that it "can be harmful or beneficial." In the context of English education, negative backwash has become an increasingly visible phenomenon.

Negative backwash occurs when high-stakes assessment leads to:

- **Curriculum narrowing**, where teaching focuses exclusively on tested content at the expense of broader subject knowledge
- **Pedagogical distortion**, with teachers adopting transmission-style approaches such as drilling and lecturing rather than exploratory, knowledge-rich instruction
- **Premature exam replication**, where pupils in Years 7, 8, and 9 are repeatedly exposed to GCSE-style tasks before they have secured foundational knowledge
- **Loss of disciplinary integrity**, as the subject becomes defined by assessment objectives rather than by its intrinsic structures and purposes

Research published in the *Journal of Education Policy* (2021) found that high-stakes assessment leads to "teacher-centred, transmission-style pedagogies such as drilling and lecturing, as well as the narrowing of curricula to align with the exam." This is particularly acute in English, where the abstract nature of language and literary study makes the security of a defined assessment framework temptingly concrete.

### The KS3 Problem: Examination Preparation in the Pre-GCSE Years

Ofsted's subject review identified a particular concern regarding Key Stage 3 English: "Preparation for external assessments can often distort the curriculum—KS3 can often be used to prepare for GCSE." This phenomenon manifests in several ways:

**Explicit Exam Preparation**
Some schools structure their entire KS3 curriculum around GCSE assessment objectives, teaching AO1 (identifying and interpreting), AO2 (language analysis), and AO3 (context) from Year 7 onwards as discrete skills to be mastered. While intention may be to provide a five-year curriculum, the result is often a thin, repetitive experience where pupils encounter the same task types repeatedly without the underlying knowledge to execute them with sophistication.

**Implicit Curriculum Shaping**
More subtly, the knowledge selected for the KS3 curriculum may be determined by what appears on GCSE specifications. The choice of nineteenth-century texts, for instance, may be driven not by their literary merit or their contribution to a coherent reading journey, but by their resemblance to GCSE set texts. As Ofsted noted, primary schools should choose texts "first and foremost on literary merit"—the same principle should apply at KS3.

**The Opportunity Cost**
Every hour spent on examination-style practice tasks is an hour not spent on knowledge building. When Year 7 pupils spend lessons attempting unseen poetry analysis in examination conditions, they are not building the knowledge of poetic forms, literary traditions, or linguistic patterns that would enable them to analyse unseen poems with genuine understanding in Year 11.

## Exam Preparation versus Knowledge Building

### The False Dichotomy

It is important to recognise that examination preparation and knowledge building are not inherently opposed. Pupils who possess rich substantive and disciplinary knowledge will, all things being equal, perform better in examinations than those who do not. The opposition arises when preparation takes the form of repeated practice of examination tasks rather than the systematic building of the knowledge that would enable success in those tasks.

Christine Counsell's distinction between substantive and disciplinary knowledge provides a useful framework here:

- **Substantive knowledge** in English includes knowledge of texts, literary periods, linguistic features, genres, and conventions—the "content" of the subject
- **Disciplinary knowledge** includes understanding of how texts are interpreted, how meanings are constructed, how literary judgments are formed and contested—the procedures and conventions of English as a discipline

Both forms of knowledge are necessary for examination success, but neither can be developed through examination practice alone.

### The Logic of Assessment Objectives

GCSE English specifications are organised around Assessment Objectives (AOs) set by Ofqual and common across all examination boards:

**English Language**
- AO1: Identify and interpret explicit and implicit information and ideas
- AO2: Explain, comment on and analyse how writers use language and structure
- AO3: Compare writers' ideas and perspectives
- AO4: Evaluate texts critically
- AO5: Communicate clearly, effectively and imaginatively
- AO6: Use a range of vocabulary and sentence structures accurately

**English Literature**
- AO1: Read, understand and respond to texts
- AO2: Analyse language, form and structure
- AO3: Show understanding of relationships between texts and contexts
- AO4: Use a range of vocabulary and sentence structures

The danger lies in treating these assessment objectives as a curriculum. When schools plan their KS3 curriculum around coverage of AO1, AO2, and AO3, they mistake the mechanism of assessment for the substance of learning. The AOs describe how pupils will demonstrate their knowledge in an examination; they do not describe what knowledge pupils need to possess.

### Knowledge-First Curriculum Design

A principled alternative is knowledge-first curriculum design, where the curriculum is structured around the substantive and disciplinary knowledge pupils need, with assessment objectives serving as criteria for evaluating whether that knowledge has been successfully acquired.

In practice, this means:

**Sequencing Knowledge Before Examination Exposure**
Pupils should encounter literary and linguistic knowledge in a coherent sequence that builds complexity over time. Examination-style tasks should be introduced only when the prerequisite knowledge has been taught and secured—not as a means of teaching that knowledge.

**Distinguishing Between Practice and Performance**
There is a legitimate place for examination practice, but it should be understood as performance preparation rather than knowledge development. Pupils need to understand examination formats, timing, and expectations, but this understanding can be developed efficiently in the months preceding examinations rather than across five years of schooling.

**Valuing the Unassessed**
The most valuable aspects of English—deep engagement with literature, exploration of ideas through writing, discussion and debate—may not map neatly onto assessment objectives. A curriculum driven by assessment will marginalise these aspects; a principled curriculum will protect them.

## Principled Assessment: A Framework

### Defining Principled Assessment

Principled assessment in English is assessment that:

1. **Serves the curriculum**, rather than driving it
2. **Supports learning**, providing useful information to teachers and pupils about what has been learned and what needs further attention
3. **Maintains disciplinary integrity**, evaluating pupils on what matters in English rather than what is easily measurable
4. **Is proportionate**, occupying an appropriate amount of curriculum time relative to its contribution to learning
5. **Is valid and reliable**, measuring what it claims to measure with consistency

This framework draws on Dylan Wiliam's work on formative assessment, Christine Counsell's writings on curriculum integrity, and the assessment principles articulated by the National Association for the Teaching of English (NATE).

### Formative Assessment: Assessment for Learning

Dylan Wiliam's research on formative assessment, developed through programmes such as the Assessment is for Learning (AiFL) initiative in Scotland and the Teacher Learner Network, established the principle that assessment is most valuable when it informs teaching and learning rather than merely judging it.

Wiliam's five key strategies for formative assessment provide a practical framework for principled assessment in English:

**1. Clarifying, Understanding and Sharing Learning Intentions**
Pupils need to understand what they are aiming to achieve. In English, this means being explicit about the knowledge and understanding that will enable success—not merely describing the task to be completed. Rather than "write an essay on the theme of power in Macbeth," a learning intention might be "to understand how Shakespeare uses the character of Lady Macbeth to explore contemporary anxieties about female authority."

**2. Engineering Effective Classroom Discussions**
English classrooms should be sites of rich dialogue about texts and language. Techniques such as "no hands up" questioning, think-pair-share, and structured debate provide teachers with information about pupil understanding while developing pupils' capacity to articulate and refine their thinking.

**3. Providing Feedback that Moves Learning Forward**
Feedback in English should be specific and actionable, focusing on the knowledge and understanding demonstrated rather than generic evaluative comments. "Your analysis of the imagery is perceptive—you identify the pattern of references to darkness and connect it to the play's exploration of moral corruption. To develop further, consider how Shakespeare develops this pattern across the different acts."

**4. Activating Students as Learning Resources for One Another**
Peer assessment and collaborative work in English can develop pupils' capacity to evaluate and improve their own work, but only when carefully structured around clear criteria derived from disciplinary knowledge.

**5. Activating Students as Owners of Their Own Learning**
Pupils should develop metacognitive awareness of their own reading and writing processes, understanding what strategies they can employ when encountering difficulty.

### Summative Assessment: Measuring What Matters

While formative assessment supports ongoing learning, summative assessment evaluates learning at a particular point in time. Principled summative assessment in English should:

**Sample Appropriately**
No single assessment can capture everything a pupil knows and can do in English. Summative assessment should sample from the domain of the subject in ways that allow valid inferences about broader knowledge and capability. This is why single-study examination texts are problematic: they assess performance on a single text rather than knowledge of literature more broadly.

**Minimise Unintended Consequences**
Assessment designers should consider how the assessment will shape teaching. If an assessment rewards formulaic writing, formulaic writing will proliferate. If it rewards genuine engagement with texts, teaching is more likely to focus on developing that engagement.

**Be Transparent**
The relationship between the curriculum taught and the assessment used should be clear. Pupils and teachers should understand what is being assessed and why.

## Avoiding Premature Exam Replication

### The Case Against Early Examination Exposure

The practice of exposing pupils to GCSE-style examination tasks years before they sit the actual examinations is widespread but educationally problematic. The arguments against premature replication include:

**Developmental Appropriateness**
GCSE examinations are designed for pupils who have completed five years of secondary English education. Asking Year 7 pupils to engage with the same tasks ignores the substantial differences in knowledge, experience, and cognitive development between an eleven-year-old and a sixteen-year-old.

**The Expertise Reversal Effect**
Cognitive research suggests that the instructional approaches appropriate for novices differ from those appropriate for more knowledgeable learners. Novices benefit from carefully structured, explicit instruction; experts can handle more open-ended problem-solving. Examination tasks are designed for relatively expert performers; deploying them with novices may actually inhibit learning.

**Motivation and Self-Efficacy**
Repeated failure at tasks designed for older, more knowledgeable pupils can damage pupils' confidence and motivation. English is a subject that should inspire and engage; premature examination exposure often achieves the opposite.

**Misplaced Curriculum Time**
Time spent on examination practice is time not spent on reading, writing, discussion, and knowledge building. The opportunity cost is substantial.

### When Examination Practice is Appropriate

This is not to say that examination practice has no place in the secondary English curriculum. Rather, its timing and quantity should be carefully considered:

**Pre-Examination Period**
The months preceding public examinations should include practice with examination formats, timing, and expectations. This is legitimate performance preparation.

**Building Examination Literacy**
Pupils need to understand how examinations work—how questions are structured, what command terms mean, how marks are allocated. This examination literacy can be taught efficiently without repeated full-examination practice.

**Diagnostic Use**
Occasional exposure to examination-style tasks can provide diagnostic information about knowledge gaps, but this should inform subsequent teaching rather than replacing it.

### Alternative Approaches to KS3 Assessment

Rather than GCSE replication, KS3 assessment in English might include:

**Low-Stakes Quizzes**
Regular retrieval practice of substantive knowledge—literary terms, text details, linguistic concepts—supporting both assessment and learning.

**Extended Writing in Authentic Contexts**
Writing for real audiences and purposes, with feedback focused on the development of ideas and craft rather than on examination criteria.

**Discussion and Oral Assessment**
Assessment of pupils' capacity to engage in scholarly dialogue about texts, recognising that much of what matters in English is difficult to capture in written form.

**Portfolio Assessment**
Collections of work over time, demonstrating progress and development rather than performance on a single occasion.

## Curriculum Integrity and the Dignity of the Subject

### Christine Counsell's Contribution

Christine Counsell's work on curriculum leadership has emphasised the importance of preserving what she calls "the dignity of the thing"—the integrity of the subject being taught. For Counsell, assessment should be subordinate to curriculum, a means of evaluating whether the curriculum has been successfully learned rather than a determinant of what the curriculum contains.

Writing in the *Impact* journal of the Chartered College of Teaching, Counsell has distinguished between:

- **Curriculum as the progression model**, where progress is understood as knowing and being able to do more of the subject
- **Curriculum as vehicle for generic skills**, where the subject becomes a context for developing transferable competencies

Assessment that serves curriculum integrity aligns with the first conception. Pupils are assessed on their knowledge and understanding of English—its texts, its conventions, its ways of knowing—rather than on generic skills that happen to be practised in English lessons.

### NATE's Principles

The National Association for the Teaching of English has articulated principles for English curriculum and assessment that emphasise:

- **Teacher autonomy** in shaping curriculum and assessment practices
- **Integration of language and literature**, resisting the separation of English Language and English Literature into distinct curricular spaces
- **The importance of talk**, recognising spoken language as fundamental to English education
- **Critical engagement**, enabling pupils to question and challenge texts and ideas

NATE's 2025 response to the government's Curriculum and Assessment Review called for reforms that would "create a modern, inclusive English curriculum that motivates young people and equips them with the skills they need for future success." Central to this vision is assessment that serves rather than constrains the curriculum.

### Practical Strategies for Maintaining Integrity

Curriculum leaders in English can take several practical steps to ensure assessment serves rather than distorts the curriculum:

**Audit Assessment Practices**
Review the assessment activities undertaken across the English department. What proportion of time is spent on examination-style tasks versus knowledge-building activities? Is this proportion appropriate at each key stage?

**Map Assessment to Knowledge**
Ensure that every assessment task is clearly linked to specific substantive or disciplinary knowledge that has been taught. Avoid assessing what has not been taught, even if it appears on examination specifications.

**Question Default Practices**
Challenge the assumption that examination preparation must begin early or occupy substantial curriculum time. What evidence supports these practices? What are the opportunity costs?

**Develop Departmental Understanding**
Ensure all English teachers understand the distinction between examination preparation and knowledge building, and the importance of principled assessment. Professional development should focus on subject knowledge and pedagogy, not merely on examination requirements.

**Engage with the Subject Community**
Draw on the resources and perspectives of organisations such as NATE, the English Association, and subject-specific research groups. These communities offer alternative visions of English education that can inform departmental thinking.

## The Role of External Assessment

### Understanding the Constraints

External assessment at GCSE and A-Level operates within constraints that curriculum leaders must understand and navigate:

**Validity Constraints**
Examinations can only sample from the domain of the subject. They cannot capture everything a pupil knows and can do. This is particularly acute in English, where the domain—literature, language, communication—is vast and varied.

**Reliability Constraints**
Assessment must produce consistent results. This tends to favour tasks that can be marked with high inter-rater reliability, potentially at the expense of tasks that might assess more authentically but less consistently.

**Practical Constraints**
Assessment must be manageable within time and resource constraints. This explains the prevalence of essay-based examination in English: it is a format that can be administered to large numbers of candidates and marked by large numbers of examiners with reasonable reliability.

### Working Within and Against Constraints

Principled curriculum leadership involves working within the constraints of external assessment while resisting their encroachment on the curriculum:

**Separate Curriculum and Assessment Design**
Design the curriculum around what pupils should know and be able to do, then map examination requirements onto that curriculum. Do not begin with examination requirements and design backwards.

**Question Genre Specialisation**
The separation of English into Language and Literature, and the further specialisation within those categories (creative writing, unseen poetry, nineteenth-century novel), reflects assessment convenience as much as disciplinary logic. Curriculum design can integrate these elements in ways that external assessment cannot.

**Maintain a Long View**
GCSE results matter, but they are not the sole purpose of English education. A curriculum that builds genuine knowledge and engagement will serve pupils better in the long term than one narrowly focused on examination performance.

## Conclusion: Towards Principled Assessment

The relationship between assessment and curriculum in English education need not be adversarial. Properly conceived, assessment serves curriculum by providing information about learning, motivating pupils, and certifying achievement. Problems arise when assessment is allowed to drive curriculum, when the demands of external examination shape the content and pedagogy of the classroom.

Principled assessment in English requires
- **Clarity about purposes**—understanding whether an assessment is formative or summative, and designing it accordingly
- **Knowledge-first design**—structuring the curriculum around what pupils need to know, then mapping assessment to that curriculum
- **Proportionality**—ensuring that assessment occupies an appropriate amount of curriculum time
- **Disciplinary integrity**—resisting the reduction of English to a set of generic skills or examination techniques
- **Teacher professionalism**—trusting English teachers to exercise judgment about what their pupils need and how best to assess their learning

The backwash effect cannot be eliminated entirely. High-stakes examinations will always exert some influence on the curriculum. But principled assessment can mitigate negative backwash, preserving space for the knowledge building, critical engagement, and creative exploration that should define English education. Assessment should be the servant of curriculum, not its master.

## Key Thinkers and Research

### Dylan Wiliam
Dylan Wiliam's research on formative assessment has been foundational in establishing the importance of assessment for learning. His work demonstrates that assessment is most powerful when it provides information that teachers can use to adapt their instruction and that pupils can use to guide their learning. Wiliam's five strategies—clarifying learning intentions, engineering effective discussions, providing feedback, activating peers, and activating learners—provide a practical framework for classroom assessment.

### Christine Counsell
Christine Counsell has been a leading voice in curriculum reform, emphasising the importance of knowledge-rich curricula and the distinction between substantive and disciplinary knowledge. Her concept of "the dignity of the thing" reminds curriculum leaders that assessment should not corrode the integrity of the subject being taught. Counsell's work on senior curriculum leadership provides guidance for ensuring that assessment serves rather than distorts curriculum.

### Arthur Hughes and Washback Research
Arthur Hughes's concept of backwash (or washback) provides a framework for understanding how assessment influences teaching and learning. Research in this tradition has documented both negative washback (where assessment narrows curriculum and encourages teaching to the test) and positive washback (where assessment supports and enhances effective teaching).

### Ofsted Subject Reviews
Ofsted's subject reviews, including the 2024 English Subject Report, provide valuable evidence about the relationship between assessment and curriculum in English education. These reviews consistently find that examination preparation can distort curriculum, and they emphasise the importance of ensuring that pupils have secure foundational knowledge before encountering complex examination tasks.

### NATE and the English Association
Subject associations such as the National Association for the Teaching of English (NATE) and the English Association provide professional communities through which teachers can develop principled approaches to assessment. These organisations offer resources, professional development, and advocacy for assessment that serves the needs of English education.

## Conclusion: The Future of Assessment in English

The relationship between assessment and curriculum in English education is not fixed. As examination specifications change, as research on assessment and learning develops, and as professional understanding evolves, new possibilities emerge for principled assessment that serves both the needs of pupils and the integrity of the subject.

The challenge for English teachers and curriculum leaders is to maintain a clear vision of what English education should achieve—deep knowledge of literature and language, critical engagement with ideas, creative expression, and effective communication—and to design assessment approaches that support these goals without allowing assessment to become the tail that wags the curricular dog.

Assessment should illuminate learning, not narrow it. It should certify achievement without distorting the curriculum that leads to that achievement. It should motivate and inform, not constrain and depress. Achieving this balance requires constant vigilance, professional knowledge, and a commitment to the dignity of English as a subject worthy of study in its own right, not merely as a vehicle for examination success.

The pupils in our classrooms deserve an English education that opens up the rich worlds of literature and language, that develops their capacity to think critically and communicate effectively, and that prepares them for a lifetime of engagement with the written and spoken word. Principled assessment—assessment that serves the curriculum, supports learning, maintains disciplinary integrity, and respects teacher professionalism—is essential to realising this vision.
