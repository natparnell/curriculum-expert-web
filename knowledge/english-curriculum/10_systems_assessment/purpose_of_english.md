# The Purpose of English: English as Distinct Subject vs Medium for Learning

## Overview

The purpose of English in the school curriculum has been contested territory throughout the history of state education in England. At the heart of this debate lies a fundamental tension: is English primarily a **distinct subject** with its own disciplinary knowledge and traditions, or is it fundamentally a **medium for learning** that serves other curricular areas? This distinction matters profoundly for curriculum design, pedagogy, and the professional identity of English teachers.

Understanding this tension—and the risks of **instrumentalisation** that arise when English is reduced purely to functional literacy skills—is essential for curriculum leaders seeking to maintain the integrity and distinctive contribution of English education whilst acknowledging its cross-curricular role.

## Historical Context: The Cox Report and Five Views of English

The National Curriculum English Working Group, chaired by Professor Brian Cox, published its influential report (*English for Ages 5 to 16*) in 1989. This document remains a touchstone for understanding the competing purposes ascribed to English teaching. Cox identified five distinct "models" or views of English that co-exist within the teaching profession:

### The Five Cox Models

**1. A "Cultural Heritage" View**

This perspective emphasises the role of English in transmitting the canon of English literature—Shakespeare, Milton, Austen, Dickens, and other writers deemed to represent the best of national cultural achievement. Under this view, English exists to introduce pupils to a shared literary inheritance and to preserve cultural continuity across generations.

**2. A "Personal Growth" View**

This model foregrounds the individual pupil's development. English is seen as a means of self-expression, creativity, and personal exploration. Reading and writing are understood as pathways to self-discovery and emotional development. This view has strong associations with progressive pedagogies and child-centred approaches.

**3. A "Cultural Analysis" View**

Emerging from critical theory and media studies, this perspective positions English as equipping pupils to critically interrogate the world around them. Children should understand how meanings are constructed, how media carries values, and how power operates through language and representation. This view has affinities with critical literacy approaches.

**4. An "Adult Needs" (or Functional Skills) View**

This instrumental perspective treats English as preparation for the demands of adult life and employment. Communication skills, literacy for the workplace, and practical writing are prioritised. The focus is on competence rather than aesthetic appreciation or critical understanding.

**5. A "Cross-Curricular" View**

Here, English is understood primarily as supporting learning across the curriculum. Literacy skills enable pupils to access history, science, geography, and other subjects. The emphasis falls on reading comprehension strategies, subject-specific vocabulary, and writing in different disciplinary forms.

These five models are not mutually exclusive, and most English teachers draw upon several in their practice. However, the balance between them has significant implications for curriculum design and departmental priorities.

## English as a Distinct Subject: Disciplinary Identity

### The Literary Dimension

English as a distinct subject is fundamentally concerned with literature—aesthetic texts that reward study for their artistic qualities, not merely their informational content. This dimension distinguishes English from generic literacy instruction.

As the English Association noted in its response to Ofsted's 2022 Research Review, the subject has a distinctive focus on "the study of literary texts of personal, cultural, social and aesthetic value." This literary core includes:

- **Canonical literature**: Works recognised within the tradition of English letters, from Chaucer through to contemporary writers
- **World literature**: Texts in translation that expand pupils' understanding of human experience beyond Anglophone contexts
- **Children's and young adult literature**: Age-appropriate texts that engage developing readers whilst offering literary quality
- **Non-fiction and media texts**: When studied for their rhetorical, aesthetic, or cultural significance rather than merely their information content

The literary dimension brings distinctive pedagogical approaches: close reading, analysis of writer's craft, exploration of themes and symbolism, and consideration of how texts construct meaning through form as well as content.

### The Cultural and Aesthetic Dimension

English education introduces pupils to aesthetic experience—to the pleasures and challenges of encountering art in language. This includes:

- **Response to literature**: Developing the capacity to respond emotionally and intellectually to literary texts
- **Creative writing**: Crafting original texts that draw upon literary conventions and techniques
- **Appreciation of linguistic craft**: Understanding how writers achieve effects through diction, syntax, imagery, and form
- **Exploration of human experience**: Using literature as a means of encountering diverse perspectives and developing empathy

This aesthetic dimension is what makes English a humanities subject akin to art or music, rather than purely a skills-based training.

### The Critical Dimension

English also develops pupils' capacity for critical thinking about texts and discourse. This includes:

- **Interpretation**: Developing and defending readings of ambiguous texts
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the quality and significance of literary works
- **Critical awareness**: Understanding how texts reflect and construct ideologies, identities, and power relations
- **Rhetorical analysis**: Examining how language persuades, positions, and produces effects

This critical dimension connects English to the wider purposes of liberal education—the development of informed, critical citizens.

### Subject-Specific Knowledge

English as a discipline comprises bodies of knowledge that are not reducible to generic literacy:

- **Literary history**: Understanding periods, movements, and traditions within literature
- **Genre knowledge**: Understanding the conventions and evolution of poetry, drama, novel, and other forms
- **Linguistic knowledge**: Understanding grammar, syntax, and discourse—often termed "knowledge about language"
- **Critical concepts**: Understanding terms such as irony, metaphor, narrative perspective, unreliable narrator, and intertextuality
- **Contextual knowledge**: Understanding how texts emerge from and respond to their historical and cultural contexts

This disciplinary knowledge gives English its distinctive contribution to the curriculum and distinguishes English teachers from generic literacy instructors.

## English as Medium for Learning: Cross-Curricular Literacy

### The Functional Role

English undeniably serves functional purposes across the curriculum. Pupils require literacy skills to:

- Read textbooks and source materials in history, geography, science, and other subjects
- Understand examination questions and assessment criteria
- Write extended responses in subject-appropriate forms
- Engage with digital texts and multimodal information sources
- Participate in discussion and collaborative learning across disciplines

This cross-curricular role has been emphasised in policy documents, particularly since the Bullock Report (*A Language for Life*, 1975) established the principle that "every teacher is a teacher of English."

### Cross-Curricular Literacy Strategies

Schools typically address this functional role through:

- **Whole-school literacy policies**: Frameworks for developing reading, writing, and oracy across subjects
- **Subject-specific literacy**: Teaching the particular reading and writing demands of different disciplines (disciplinary literacy)
- **Vocabulary development**: Building academic and technical vocabulary across the curriculum
- **Extended writing**: Developing pupils' capacity to construct coherent, extended texts

These approaches recognise that literacy is not a generic set of transferable skills but varies significantly across disciplinary contexts. Reading in science requires different strategies than reading in history or English literature.

### The Challenge of Instrumentalisation

**Instrumentalisation** occurs when English is reduced to purely functional purposes—when the subject is treated as merely a vehicle for employability skills, cross-curricular access, or measurable literacy outcomes. This risks:

- **Displacement of literary content**: Reducing time spent on literature in favour of functional literacy drills
- **Loss of aesthetic focus**: Treating texts purely as sources of information or exercises in comprehension skill
- **Narrowing of writing purposes**: Focusing exclusively on transactional writing (essays, reports) at the expense of creative and expressive forms
- **Deskilling of teachers**: Treating English teachers as generic literacy instructors rather than subject specialists
- **Diminished pupil experience**: Denying pupils access to the transformative possibilities of literary engagement

The Driver Youth Trust (2021) observed this tension in secondary schools, noting how English teachers' passion for literature could be undermined by pressure to cover "basic literacy skills that all secondary subjects need."

## The Ofsted Perspective: Subject Integrity and Quality

Ofsted's 2022 Research Review Series: English attempted to synthesise research evidence on effective English education. The review identified factors contributing to high-quality English provision, including:

### Curriculum Intent

Ofsted emphasised that high-quality English curricula:

- Prioritise **literary knowledge** alongside literacy skills
- Include **substantial engagement with literature** rather than treating texts as mere comprehension exercises
- Develop **knowledge about language** (grammar, rhetoric, textual conventions) as well as language use
- Build **cultural capital** through exposure to significant literary works

The review distinguished between "literary knowledge" (knowledge of texts, genres, periods, and critical concepts) and "literacy" (functional reading and writing skills). Both matter, but literary knowledge gives English its distinctive disciplinary character.

### Pedagogical Quality

Ofsted's subsequent subject report (2024) found that in some schools, "pupils carry out time-filling activities that lack purpose and do not help them to make progress in English." The report emphasised that schools should choose texts "first and foremost on literary merit" rather than purely on accessibility or relevance.

This signals Ofsted's concern that instrumental approaches—teaching English purely as skills preparation or cross-curricular service—can undermine quality.

### Critiques of the Ofsted Review

The English Association and other bodies critiqued the 2022 Research Review for presenting "a limited set of priorities and preferences for English teaching" that did not "do justice to the full breadth and range of research in English." Specific concerns included:

- Inadequate attention to **creative writing** and **reader-response** approaches
- Insufficient recognition of the value of **non-fiction** and **media texts**
- Over-emphasis on certain research traditions at the expense of others

These critiques highlight ongoing debates about the appropriate balance between different purposes and models of English.

## Maintaining Subject Identity: Strategies for Curriculum Leaders

### Articulating Distinctive Contribution

Curriculum leaders should be able to articulate clearly what English contributes that other subjects do not:

- The **aesthetic dimension**: Developing appreciation of literary art and creative expression
- The **ethical dimension**: Using literature to explore moral questions and develop empathy
- The **cultural dimension**: Engaging with the literary heritage and diverse contemporary voices
- The **critical dimension**: Developing sophisticated capacities for interpretation, analysis, and evaluation

This articulation should inform curriculum design, resource allocation, and departmental self-evaluation.

### Protecting Literary Content

Time and resource pressures can erode literary content in favour of functional literacy. Curriculum leaders should:

- Ensure that **literature remains central** to the curriculum at all key stages
- Protect **extended reading** of whole texts rather than reliance on extracts
- Maintain **creative writing** alongside transactional forms
- Invest in **high-quality texts** that represent diverse traditions and contemporary voices

### Developing Subject-Specific Pedagogy

English requires distinctive pedagogical approaches that go beyond generic literacy instruction:

- **Close reading**: Teaching pupils to attend to textual detail and writer's craft
- **Discussion-based learning**: Using dialogue to develop interpretation and critical thinking
- **Creative writing workshops**: Teaching composition as craft, with attention to technique and revision
- **Comparative study**: Developing understanding of how texts relate to traditions and contexts

Generic literacy strategies (comprehension worksheets, phonics programmes, writing frames) have their place but should not dominate English pedagogy.

### Collaborating Without Subordination

Cross-curricular literacy collaboration is valuable but should not subordinate English to service roles:

- English teachers can contribute expertise on **reading strategies** and **writing development** without becoming generic literacy consultants
- Collaborative planning should respect **disciplinary differences** in literacy practices
- Assessment of literacy across the curriculum should not displace **English-specific assessment** of literary knowledge and creative achievement

### Professional Identity and Development

English teachers' professional identity is grounded in subject expertise:

- **Initial teacher education** should develop literary scholarship alongside pedagogical skill
- **Continuing professional development** should include engagement with literary and critical theory
- **Departmental culture** should value literary discussion and creative practice, not only assessment data

When English teachers are treated as generic literacy instructors, both recruitment and retention suffer.

## Key Debates and Tensions

### Literacy vs Literature

The tension between English as literacy instruction and English as literary education has persisted since the subject's emergence in the late nineteenth century. Contemporary manifestations include:

- **Primary English**: Balancing systematic synthetic phonics with reading for pleasure and literary response
- **GCSE English**: Maintaining substantial literature content alongside language skills
- **Vocational pathways**: Whether non-GCSE routes can maintain subject integrity or inevitably reduce English to functional skills

### Access vs Standards

A related tension concerns whether English should prioritise **access** (ensuring all pupils achieve functional competence) or **standards** (maintaining challenging content for high attainers). The risk is that instrumental approaches aimed at raising basic attainment may limit opportunities for more ambitious literary study.

### Relevance vs Tradition

Debates about curriculum content often pit **relevance** (texts that reflect pupils' contemporary experiences and identities) against **tradition** (canonical works that represent established cultural value). A well-designed curriculum can—and should—include both, but resource constraints and assessment pressures can narrow the range.

### Measurement vs Authenticity

Assessment systems increasingly shape English teaching. The risk is that **measurable outcomes** (comprehension scores, writing metrics) displace **authentic engagement** with literature and language. Curriculum leaders must navigate this tension without allowing assessment to completely determine curriculum content.

## Pedagogical Implications

### For Primary Practitioners

- Maintain **reading for pleasure** and **response to literature** alongside phonics and comprehension skill
- Use **high-quality texts** as the foundation for literacy instruction, not merely as vehicles for skill practice
- Develop **creative writing** as expressive practice, not only transactional forms
- Build **subject knowledge** about language (grammar, vocabulary, text types) in meaningful contexts

### For Secondary Practitioners

- Protect **literary study** as a distinctive component of English, not merely preparation for GCSE assessment
- Teach **writing as craft**, with attention to authorial choices and rhetorical effects
- Develop **discussion** as a means of constructing interpretation, not only assessing prior knowledge
- Maintain **creative writing** as a valued component of English, not an optional extra

### For Curriculum Leaders

- **Articulate clearly** the distinctive contribution of English to pupils' education
- **Resist pressures** to reduce English to purely functional or service roles
- **Invest in texts** and resources that support literary and creative engagement
- **Develop teachers** as subject specialists with ongoing literary and critical engagement
- **Evaluate provision** against subject-specific criteria, not only generic literacy metrics

### For Whole-School Leadership

- Recognise English's **dual role**—both distinct subject and cross-curricular foundation—without allowing either to eclipse the other
- Support **literacy across the curriculum** without making English responsible for other subjects' literacy outcomes
- Value **creative and aesthetic dimensions** of education alongside measurable attainment
- Resource **English departments** adequately to maintain literary content and creative practice

## Conclusion

The purpose of English in the curriculum cannot be reduced to a single formulation. The subject serves multiple legitimate purposes: aesthetic appreciation, personal development, critical understanding, cultural transmission, and functional literacy. The Cox Report's five models continue to offer a useful map of this terrain.

However, the risk of **instrumentalisation**—reducing English purely to functional skills, cross-curricular service, or measurable outcomes—is real and consequential. When English loses its literary, aesthetic, and critical dimensions, it becomes a diminished subject, and pupils are denied access to the distinctive benefits that high-quality English education can provide.

Curriculum leaders must therefore be vigilant in **maintaining subject identity**—articulating what makes English distinctive, protecting literary content and creative practice, and developing teachers as subject specialists. This is not romanticism or resistance to accountability; it is recognition that functional literacy alone does not constitute an English education worthy of the name.

The challenge for the profession is to honour English's cross-curricular role without subordinating the subject to it—to teach literacy through literature, and to ensure that all pupils, not only the already advantaged, encounter the transformative possibilities of engagement with literary art.

## Key Takeaways

1. **English has multiple legitimate purposes**—cultural heritage, personal growth, cultural analysis, adult needs, and cross-curricular support. No single model captures the subject's full value.

2. **Instrumentalisation poses real risks**—reducing English to functional skills or cross-curricular service can displace literary content, aesthetic engagement, and creative practice.

3. **Subject identity matters**—English contributes distinctive disciplinary knowledge (literary history, genre knowledge, critical concepts) that is not reducible to generic literacy.

4. **Literature must remain central**—high-quality English curricula prioritise substantial engagement with literary texts studied for their aesthetic and cultural significance.

5. **Pedagogy should be subject-specific**—English requires distinctive approaches (close reading, discussion, creative writing workshops) that go beyond generic literacy instruction.

6. **Cross-curricular collaboration requires boundaries**—English can contribute to whole-school literacy without becoming subordinated to service roles.

7. **Professional identity is grounded in subject expertise**—English teachers' authority derives from literary and critical knowledge, not only pedagogical technique.

8. **Assessment should serve curriculum aims**—measurable outcomes have their place but should not completely determine curriculum content or pedagogy.

9. **Access and challenge can co-exist**—well-designed curricula ensure all pupils develop functional literacy whilst also encountering challenging literary content.

10. **Ongoing vigilance is required**—pressures toward instrumentalisation are structural and persistent; maintaining subject integrity requires active, ongoing effort from curriculum leaders and the profession.
