# Secondary Reading Catch-Up: Supporting Weaker Readers at KS3

## Introduction: The Scale of the Challenge

The transition from primary to secondary school represents a critical juncture for students with reading difficulties. Ofsted's landmark report *Now the whole school is reading: Supporting struggling readers in secondary school* (2022) revealed that a significant proportion of pupils arrive at secondary school unable to read fluently enough to access the curriculum. These students face a double disadvantage: they must simultaneously catch up on reading skills whilst navigating increasingly complex disciplinary texts across all subjects.

The National Literacy Trust's research (2024) demonstrates that reading difficulties at secondary level correlate strongly with reduced self-esteem, disengagement from school, and limited future opportunities. Students who cannot read fluently by the end of Key Stage 3 rarely catch up, making early intervention at the start of secondary school essential.

This knowledge file examines diagnostic approaches for identifying reading difficulties, explores the crucial distinction between acceleration and remediation strategies, and provides practical guidance for implementing effective catch-up programmes that enable weaker readers to make rapid progress whilst remaining engaged with age-appropriate curriculum content.

## Understanding the Reading Gap at Secondary Transition

### The Nature of the Problem

Secondary schools inherit pupils with widely varying reading abilities. Whilst the majority enter Year 7 with functional reading skills, a significant minority—often estimated at 20-25% in disadvantaged cohorts—arrive with reading ages substantially below their chronological age. Ofsted's research found that schools frequently underestimated the extent of reading difficulties because standardised reading tests administered at transition primarily assess comprehension rather than the foundational skills of decoding and fluency.

The reading gap manifests in several distinct forms:

**Decoding difficulties** affect students who struggle to translate written words into spoken language. These pupils may have missed systematic synthetic phonics instruction or may have specific learning difficulties such as dyslexia. They often guess words from initial letters or context rather than reading them accurately.

**Fluency problems** characterise students who can decode accurately but read slowly and laboriously, draining cognitive resources that should be directed towards comprehension. These readers may decode phonetically regular words successfully but lack automaticity, making reading a conscious, effortful process.

**Comprehension deficits** affect students who read accurately and fluently but struggle to extract meaning, make inferences, or understand text structure. These "good readers but poor comprehenders" (as identified in the Reciprocal Reading Secondary research) often go unnoticed because their oral reading appears competent.

**Vocabulary limitations** constrain students whose decoding and fluency are adequate but whose limited word knowledge impedes understanding of academic texts. This group is particularly disadvantaged in subjects with specialised disciplinary vocabularies.

### Why Early Secondary Intervention Matters

Research consistently shows that reading interventions become less effective as students get older. The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) notes that raw scores for word reading accuracy show characteristic dips around secondary school entry and again around age 15, suggesting that the early secondary years represent both a vulnerability and an opportunity.

The secondary curriculum compounds reading difficulties through several mechanisms:

**Increased text complexity**: The linguistic demands of secondary texts increase dramatically, with more abstract vocabulary, complex sentence structures, and implicit meanings.

**Reduced explicit reading instruction**: Unlike primary schools, where reading is a central focus, secondary schools typically assume reading competence and provide minimal direct teaching of reading strategies.

**Multiplied reading demands**: Students must read across multiple subjects, each with its own disciplinary conventions, vocabulary, and text types.

**Concealment of difficulties**: Secondary students become increasingly adept at masking reading problems through avoidance strategies, copying from peers, or appearing disruptive when asked to read aloud.

## Diagnostic Approaches: Identifying Specific Needs

### Moving Beyond Reading Age Scores

Traditional reading assessments that yield a single reading age score are insufficient for secondary reading catch-up planning. As Ofsted's research emphasises, such tests mainly assess comprehension and provide limited insight into whether pupils need support with decoding, fluency, or both.

Effective diagnostic assessment must answer three questions:

1. **Can the student decode accurately?** This requires assessment of phonological awareness, grapheme-phoneme correspondence knowledge, and word-reading accuracy including both real and pseudo-words.

2. **Does the student read fluently?** Fluency assessment examines reading rate (words per minute), prosody (expression and phrasing), and accuracy under timed conditions.

3. **Does the student understand what they read?** Comprehension assessment evaluates literal understanding, inference-making, and higher-order thinking about texts.

### Diagnostic Assessment Tools

**Phonics Screening for Secondary Students**

The Year 1 Phonics Screening Check format can be adapted for older pupils to assess decoding ability. Students who struggle with pseudo-word reading likely have gaps in phonics knowledge. The Dyslexia-SpLD Trust and other organisations provide secondary-appropriate phonics assessments that identify specific code knowledge gaps.

**Fluency Assessment**

Curriculum-based measurement (CBM) provides a practical approach to fluency assessment. Students read standardised passages aloud for one minute, with words correct per minute (WCPM) calculated. Benchmarks from organisations such as FFT's Reading Assessment Programme (RAP) provide normative comparisons and standardised scores with reading ages.

**Comprehension Evaluation**

The distinction between decoding/fluency and comprehension is critical. The Reciprocal Reading Secondary research specifically targeted students with relatively weaker comprehension skills compared to their reading accuracy—the "good readers but poor comprehenders." Diagnostic Reading Analysis (DRA), available through the EEF's measures database, provides standardised assessment of comprehension alongside accuracy.

**Vocabulary Assessment**

Vocabulary breadth and depth can be assessed through tools such as the British Picture Vocabulary Scale (BPVS) for receptive vocabulary or standardised tests of expressive vocabulary. Academic word knowledge—particularly knowledge of tier 2 and tier 3 words—requires subject-specific assessment.

### Using Diagnostic Data to Target Intervention

Diagnostic assessment data enables precise targeting of intervention resources. Ofsted's research found that schools using analytical diagnostic approaches could design additional teaching programmes that met pupils' specific needs. Rather than generic "reading support," these schools knew precisely what to teach each student.

Diagnostic data should inform decisions about:

- **Intervention type**: Decoding difficulties require phonics-based approaches; fluency problems need repeated reading and modelling; comprehension deficits benefit from strategy instruction.

- **Grouping**: Students with similar profiles can be grouped together for targeted teaching, though individual needs should also be considered.

- **Curriculum access**: Students with severe decoding difficulties may need modified texts or audio support whilst receiving intervention; those with comprehension difficulties can often access age-appropriate texts with appropriate scaffolding.

## Acceleration Versus Remediation: Strategic Choices

### Defining the Approaches

The distinction between acceleration and remediation represents a fundamental strategic choice in reading catch-up programming. Research and practice increasingly favour acceleration approaches for the majority of students.

**Remediation** focuses on identifying gaps in prior learning and providing instruction to fill those gaps before expecting students to engage with grade-level content. Remediation typically operates from a deficit model, pulling students back to work on skills and content from earlier year groups.

**Acceleration** keeps students with their peers, providing just-in-time support and prerequisite teaching to enable access to grade-level content. Rather than going backwards to go forwards, acceleration provides the specific prior knowledge and skills needed for upcoming learning.

### Why Acceleration Beats Remediation

Emerging evidence strongly supports acceleration over remediation for most catch-up scenarios. Research from the United States during the pandemic recovery period found that students receiving acceleration made greater progress than those receiving remediation, even when starting from significant deficits.

The advantages of acceleration include:

**Maintained curriculum access**: Students continue to encounter grade-appropriate vocabulary, concepts, and text types rather than being confined to simplified materials designed for younger children.

**Preserved engagement**: Working on age-appropriate content maintains student motivation and self-concept. Remediation materials designed for primary-aged children can alienate and demotivate secondary students.

**Efficient use of time**: Acceleration focuses intervention on the specific prerequisites needed for upcoming content rather than systematically re-teaching entire earlier programmes of study.

**Continued challenge**: Students working below age-related expectations still benefit from high expectations and challenging content, appropriately supported.

### When Remediation Remains Necessary

Despite the advantages of acceleration, remediation remains appropriate for some students:

**Severe foundational deficits**: Students with significant gaps in phonics knowledge or basic decoding skills may need targeted phonics remediation before they can benefit from acceleration approaches.

**Specific learning difficulties**: Students with dyslexia or other specific learning difficulties may require systematic, structured programmes that address foundational skills.

**English as an additional language**: Students who are literate in their first language but new to English may need specific language remediation whilst maintaining curriculum access through first-language resources.

**Very low starting points**: Students entering secondary school with reading ages significantly below eight years may need intensive foundational work before acceleration becomes viable.

### Hybrid Approaches: The Best of Both

Many effective catch-up programmes combine elements of both approaches. Students might receive:

- **Accelerated curriculum access** through adapted texts, scaffolding, and support in mainstream lessons
- **Targeted remediation** in specific foundational areas identified through diagnostic assessment
- **Just-in-time pre-teaching** of vocabulary and concepts before they are encountered in mainstream lessons

This hybrid model ensures that students do not fall further behind in curriculum coverage whilst addressing the specific skill gaps that impede their reading development.

## Evidence-Based Intervention Strategies

### Phonics-Based Interventions for Older Pupils

Students arriving at secondary school with decoding difficulties require systematic synthetic phonics instruction adapted for older learners. Key principles include:

**Age-appropriate materials**: Phonics programmes for secondary students must use vocabulary, images, and contexts suitable for adolescent learners rather than infant materials.

**Rapid progression**: Older students can move through phonics phases more quickly than younger children, consolidating knowledge at an accelerated pace.

**Integration with morphology**: Teaching of roots, prefixes, and suffixes supports both decoding and vocabulary development.

**Little Wandle Rapid Catch-Up** and **Fresh Start** are two programmes specifically designed for older readers needing phonics intervention. Both use systematic synthetic phonics with age-appropriate content.

### Fluency Development Approaches

**Repeated Reading**

Research from the Sandringham Research School and others demonstrates that repeated reading improves fluency when appropriate feedback is provided. Students read aloud a short passage repeatedly until they reach a competent level of fluency. This builds automaticity and reduces the cognitive load of decoding.

**Modelling and Scaffolding**

Teacher modelling of fluent reading, followed by paired or choral reading, provides crucial support. The gradual release of responsibility model—moving from teacher modelling to supported practice to independent application—structures fluency development.

**Paired Reading**

In paired reading schemes, students read simultaneously with a more fluent partner (teacher, teaching assistant, or peer), with the more fluent reader providing immediate correction and support. This provides high levels of success and immediate feedback.

### Comprehension Strategy Instruction

**Reciprocal Reading**

The Reciprocal Reading Secondary (RRS) programme, developed by the University of Edinburgh and evaluated through Nuffield Foundation-funded research, represents one of the most thoroughly researched comprehension interventions for secondary students. A Phase 2 trial found positive effects on reading (effect size +0.13 to +0.25) in the older secondary population.

RRS explicitly teaches four key strategies:
- **Predicting**: Using prior knowledge and text features to anticipate content
- **Clarifying**: Identifying and resolving comprehension breakdowns
- **Questioning**: Generating questions about text content
- **Summarising**: Distilling main ideas and key information

The programme is designed for students who are "good readers but poor comprehenders"—those with adequate decoding and fluency but comprehension difficulties.

**Reciprocal Teaching**

Originating from the work of Palincsar and Brown, reciprocal teaching structures comprehension instruction through the gradual transfer of responsibility from teacher to students. Students learn to apply comprehension strategies flexibly across texts.

**Text Structure Instruction**

Teaching students to recognise common text structures (chronological, cause-effect, problem-solution, compare-contrast) improves comprehension and supports summarisation. Graphic organisers support visual representation of text structures.

### Vocabulary Development Programmes

**Tier 2 Vocabulary Instruction**

Beck, McKeown, and Kucan's framework distinguishes tier 1 (common, everyday words), tier 2 (sophisticated, academic words), and tier 3 (subject-specific technical words). Catch-up programmes should prioritise tier 2 words that appear across academic texts.

**Morphological Awareness**

Teaching students to recognise and use prefixes, suffixes, and root words supports both decoding and vocabulary inference. Understanding that "unhappy" contains the prefix "un-" (not) and the root "happy" enables students to infer meaning of unfamiliar words.

**Contextualised Vocabulary Teaching**

Vocabulary is most effectively taught in context, with multiple exposures across different contexts and active use by students. Pre-teaching key vocabulary before reading supports comprehension.

### Technology-Enhanced Interventions

**Computer-Based Interventions**

The Department for Education's *Literacy and numeracy catch-up strategies* (2018) found that computer-based interventions can be effective. Programmes such as Accelerated Reader provide structured practice with immediate feedback and progress monitoring.

**Text-to-Speech Technology**

For students with severe decoding difficulties, text-to-speech technology provides curriculum access whilst foundational skills are developed. This prevents students from falling further behind in content learning whilst receiving remediation.

**Audio Books**

Listening to high-quality audio books whilst following along with the text supports both fluency development and engagement with age-appropriate literature.

## Organising Effective Catch-Up Provision

### Universal, Targeted, and Intensive Support

Effective reading catch-up operates across three tiers, consistent with the response to intervention (RTI) model:

**Universal (Tier 1)**: High-quality teaching in all lessons that supports weaker readers through scaffolding, differentiation, and attention to literacy demands. All teachers take responsibility for literacy development in their subjects.

**Targeted (Tier 2)**: Small-group interventions for students identified through screening as needing additional support. These interventions supplement rather than replace classroom teaching.

**Intensive (Tier 3)**: Individual or very small-group interventions for students with significant reading difficulties. These programmes are typically delivered by specialists and may include specialised approaches for specific learning difficulties.

### Staffing and Expertise

Ofsted's research emphasised that staff who teach reading must have the expertise they need to teach weaker readers effectively. This has several implications:

**Training**: Teaching assistants and intervention tutors need specific training in the programmes they deliver. Generic "support" without structured approaches is unlikely to be effective.

**Subject expertise**: English teachers and literacy specialists should lead on reading intervention, though cross-curricular approaches ensure that reading development is supported across subjects.

**External expertise**: Schools may need to access specialist teachers or educational psychologists for students with specific learning difficulties.

### Scheduling and Intensity

Research suggests that intervention intensity matters. Effective programmes typically provide:

- **Frequency**: At least three sessions per week, preferably daily
- **Duration**: 20-30 minutes per session (shorter, more frequent sessions are more effective than longer, less frequent ones)
- **Duration of programme**: 10-12 weeks minimum for measurable impact
- **Timing**: Sessions scheduled to avoid withdrawal from subjects where students might succeed

The EEF's guidance emphasises that intervention should be additional to and distinct from mainstream lessons, not a substitute for them.

### Progress Monitoring

Regular assessment enables monitoring of intervention effectiveness and adjustment of provision:

**Formative assessment**: Ongoing monitoring during intervention sessions enables immediate adjustment of teaching.

**Benchmark assessment**: Periodic standardised assessment (every 6-8 weeks) measures progress against national norms.

**Exit criteria**: Clear criteria for exiting intervention prevent students remaining in programmes longer than necessary and enable efficient use of resources.

## Creating a Reading-Focused School Culture

### The Whole-School Imperative

Ofsted's title—*Now the whole school is reading*—reflects the finding that effective schools make reading everyone's responsibility. A reading-focused culture includes:

**Visibility of reading**: Reading is visibly valued, with displays, book recommendations, and reading role models throughout the school.

**Time for reading**: Dedicated time for reading, including independent reading and teacher reading aloud, communicates that reading matters.

**Reading across the curriculum**: All subject teachers support reading development through attention to disciplinary literacy, vocabulary instruction, and comprehension support.

**Parental engagement**: Parents are supported to encourage reading at home, including guidance on supporting struggling readers without creating anxiety.

### Addressing Barriers to Reading

**Social and Emotional Factors**

Students who have experienced reading failure often develop negative associations with reading. Effective programmes address:

- **Anxiety**: Creating low-stakes environments where mistakes are expected and learning is supported
- **Self-concept**: Building reader identity through success and recognition of progress
- **Motivation**: Connecting reading to interests and purposes that matter to students

**Access to Books**

The National Literacy Trust's research shows that access to books at home significantly influences reading achievement. Schools can address this through:

- **Well-stocked libraries** with high-interest, age-appropriate books at varied reading levels
- **Book ownership schemes** that enable students to build personal collections
- **Digital access** to e-books and audiobooks

### Long-Term Sustainability

Reading catch-up is not a one-time intervention but an ongoing commitment. Sustainable provision includes:

- **Early identification**: Robust assessment at transition and ongoing screening
- **Flexible provision**: Capacity to respond as students make progress or new needs emerge
- **Professional development**: Ongoing training to ensure all staff can support reading development
- **Resource allocation**: Secured funding for materials, staff time, and specialist support

## Conclusion: Principles for Effective Practice

Supporting weaker readers at Key Stage 3 requires strategic, evidence-informed approaches that combine diagnostic precision with high-quality teaching. The following principles guide effective practice:

1. **Assess before intervening**: Diagnostic assessment that distinguishes decoding, fluency, and comprehension difficulties enables targeted, efficient intervention.

2. **Accelerate rather than remediate**: Where possible, keep students with their peers and provide just-in-time support rather than pulling students back to earlier content.

3. **Use evidence-based programmes**: Structured interventions such as Reciprocal Reading Secondary, systematic phonics programmes, and fluency approaches have demonstrated effectiveness.

4. **Ensure expertise**: Staff delivering interventions need specific training and ongoing support to implement programmes with fidelity.

5. **Monitor progress**: Regular assessment enables adjustment of provision and ensures that students exit interventions when they have achieved appropriate proficiency.

6. **Maintain the whole-school focus**: Reading catch-up is most effective when it occurs within a school culture that values reading and supports literacy development across all subjects.

The early secondary years represent a final opportunity to address reading difficulties before they become entrenched barriers to achievement. With appropriate diagnostic assessment, targeted intervention, and a commitment to keeping students engaged with challenging, age-appropriate content, schools can enable weaker readers to make the progress necessary for success across the curriculum and beyond.
