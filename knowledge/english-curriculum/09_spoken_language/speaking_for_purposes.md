# Speaking for Different Purposes

## Introduction: Why Speaking Purpose Matters

The National Curriculum for English in England establishes that pupils should be taught to "speak clearly, fluently and with confidence in any situation, including presenting and debating." This requirement reflects a fundamental truth about spoken language: how we speak must be adapted to match our purpose, audience, and context. The curriculum explicitly requires pupils to use "Standard English confidently in a range of formal and informal contexts" and to participate in "formal debates and structured discussions."

Research consistently demonstrates that pupils develop stronger speaking capabilities when explicitly taught to recognise and adapt to different speaking purposes. Ofsted's English Subject Report (2023) noted that "pupils need opportunities to practise, refine and apply speaking and listening skills in a range of different contexts and for a range of different audiences." Without such explicit instruction, pupils may struggle to transfer conversational skills to more formal contexts, or conversely, may apply overly formal registers inappropriately.

This knowledge file examines the major categories of speaking purpose within the English curriculum: presentational talk, performance speaking, debate and argumentation, and the crucial distinction between formal and informal registers. Each requires distinct linguistic features, structural approaches, and pedagogical strategies.

## Presentational Talk

### Defining Presentational Talk

Presentational talk refers to extended speaking where the primary purpose is to inform, explain, or persuade an audience. Unlike conversational dialogue, presentational talk is typically sustained by a single speaker (or small group) with the audience in a listening rather than interactive role. The Education Endowment Foundation's Oracy Toolkit (2017) identified presentational speech as one of three key oracy competencies, alongside instructional talk and group discussion.

The National Curriculum requires pupils to give "short speeches and presentations, expressing their own ideas and keeping to the point." This mandate spans key stages, with increasing sophistication expected as pupils progress through primary and secondary education.

### Characteristics of Effective Presentational Talk

Effective presentational talk exhibits several distinguishing features that teachers should explicitly model and teach:

**Structural Organisation**: Presentational talk requires clear structure—an engaging opening, logically sequenced content, and a purposeful conclusion. Younger pupils may follow simple chronological or categorical structures, while older pupils employ more sophisticated patterns such as problem-solution, cause-effect, or thesis-antithesis-synthesis.

**Audience Awareness**: Unlike casual conversation, presentational talk demands conscious attention to what the audience already knows, needs to know, and might find engaging. The speaker must bridge the gap between their own knowledge and the audience's understanding.

**Rhetorical Devices**: The curriculum encourages pupils to develop awareness of rhetorical techniques including repetition for emphasis, rhetorical questions to engage thinking, and purposeful pausing for effect.

**Paralinguistic Features**: Volume, pace, pitch, and tone must be consciously modulated to maintain audience engagement and emphasise key points. Oracy Cambridge emphasises that "our aim ought to be to enable them to feel the buzz that comes from sensing that your audience finds what you have to say interesting or useful."

### Teaching Presentational Talk

**Scaffolded Practice**: Begin with heavily scaffolded activities—talk frames, sentence stems, and structured planning templates—gradually removing support as pupils develop confidence and competence.

**Purposeful Topics**: Presentations should address topics where pupils have genuine expertise or interest. Asking pupils to present on subjects they barely understand forces them to read aloud rather than genuinely present.

**Multiple Opportunities**: The Ofsted English Subject Report identified that teachers often attribute pupils' weaknesses in speaking to lack of confidence "rather than realising that they have not been taught what they need to know about the topic under discussion to be able to form and articulate worthwhile contributions."

**Feedback Focus**: Feedback should address both content (what was said) and delivery (how it was said), with pupils learning to self-assess against criteria for effective presentation.

## Performance Speaking and Drama

### The Role of Performance in Speaking Development

Performance speaking occupies a distinctive position in the English curriculum. The National Curriculum notes that drama techniques "can be used to develop spoken language, reading and writing" while also being "outcomes in their own right: as an effective performance for an audience." Drama is described as a "statutory golden thread running through the English curriculum, from Early Years through to Key Stage 3 and beyond."

Process drama—where pupils engage in dramatic activities without the pressure of final performance—has demonstrated significant benefits for speaking development. Research by Coleman (2020) and Stinson (2018) identified four dimensions of oral communicative skills developed through drama: functional communication, dialogical interaction, linguistic complexity, and paralinguistic awareness.

### Types of Performance Speaking

**Scripted Performance**: Reciting or performing from scripted texts develops clarity, projection, and interpretive skills. Pupils learn to make someone else's words their own while maintaining authenticity.

**Improvisation**: Unscripted dramatic work develops spontaneous thinking, responsive listening, and the ability to maintain character and situation while speaking.

**Readers Theatre**: A middle ground where pupils perform from texts while holding scripts, allowing focus on vocal expression rather than memorisation.

**Choral Speaking**: Group recitation develops awareness of rhythm, timing, and collective voice while reducing individual pressure.

### Pedagogical Approaches to Performance Speaking

**The Mantle of the Expert**: Dorothy Heathcote's influential approach positions pupils as expert practitioners—scientists, historians, advisors—speaking within a fictional frame. This creates authentic contexts for formal speech while maintaining the safety of role-play.

**Teacher-in-Role**: When teachers adopt roles, they model the register, vocabulary, and manner of speaking appropriate to different contexts, providing implicit instruction that pupils can adopt and adapt.

**Process Before Product**: Effective drama pedagogy prioritises the learning that occurs during dramatic exploration over polished final performances. The Speaking and Listening requirements should be embedded within ongoing classroom activity rather than treated as separate assessment events.

**Inclusive Participation**: Drama can engage reluctant speakers by providing the "mask" of character. However, teachers must ensure that quieter pupils are not always relegated to minor roles while confident speakers dominate.

## Debate and Argumentation

### Debate as a Pedagogical Tool

Debate represents one of the most cognitively demanding speaking purposes. The National Curriculum requires pupils to "participate in formal debates and structured discussions," recognising that debate develops not only speaking skills but also critical thinking, research capabilities, and understanding of multiple perspectives.

Sheffield Hallam University's Learning and Teaching Approaches guidance defines debate as "a teaching approach where students are given a fairly controversial topic to research and discuss, taking opposing sides of the issue, and so develop their understanding through argumentation and reasoning." Research consistently demonstrates that debate constitutes "a conducive pedagogy for honing argumentation skills."

### Components of Effective Debate

**Claim and Evidence**: Pupils must learn to support assertions with evidence, distinguishing between opinion and argument.

**Rebuttal and Refutation**: Counter-argumentation requires understanding opposing positions thoroughly enough to identify weaknesses while maintaining respect for alternative viewpoints.

**Structured Format**: The UK Parliament's education resources recommend teaching debate through clear structures: opening statement, main arguments, rebuttal, class participation, and closing statement.

**Reasoning Chains**: Effective debaters construct logical sequences from evidence through reasoning to conclusion, making their thinking transparent to audiences.

### Teaching Debate in the Classroom

**Scaffolded Controversy**: Begin with structured controversies where pupils understand both sides will be explored, reducing the tendency to adopt positions uncritically.

**Evidence-First Approach**: Require research and evidence gathering before position-taking, ensuring arguments are substantive rather than merely rhetorical.

**Devil's Advocate**: Teach pupils to argue against their own positions, developing cognitive flexibility and appreciation for legitimate disagreement.

**Cross-Curricular Integration**: As Edutopia notes, "Every subject area offers an opportunity to engage students in debate"—from ethical questions in science to interpretation disputes in history.

**Respectful Disagreement**: Establish classroom norms where challenge is directed at ideas rather than individuals, modelling the distinction between intellectual disagreement and personal conflict.

## Formal and Informal Registers

### Understanding Register

Register refers to the way language varies according to context, purpose, and audience. The National Curriculum explicitly requires pupils to use "Standard English confidently in a range of formal and informal contexts, including classroom discussion." This requirement acknowledges that linguistic flexibility—knowing when to shift between registers—is a crucial communicative competence.

Jim Cummins' influential distinction between Basic Interpersonal Communicative Skills (BICS) and Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP) illuminates why register matters in educational contexts. BICS—social, contextualised language—typically develops within 1-2 years of exposure to a new language. CALP—the abstract, decontextualised language of academic learning—requires 5-7 years to develop fully. This framework explains why pupils may appear fluent in playground conversation while struggling with formal classroom discourse.

### Characteristics of Formal Register

Formal register exhibits specific linguistic features that teachers should make explicit:

**Complete Grammatical Structures**: Formal speech tends toward complete sentences rather than fragments, with explicit subjects and verbs.

**Standard English**: The National Curriculum mandates Standard English for formal contexts, including consistent verb agreement, conventional pronoun usage, and standardised vocabulary.

**Low Frequency Vocabulary**: Formal contexts employ more specialised, Latinate vocabulary—"ascertain" rather than "find out," "demonstrate" rather than "show."

**Nominalisation**: Formal discourse frequently turns verbs into nouns ("The implementation of the policy..." rather than "When they put the policy into practice...")

**Explicit Logical Markers**: Formal speech makes reasoning explicit through connectors like "therefore," "consequently," "nevertheless," and "in contrast."

**Reduced Personal Reference**: Formal contexts often minimise first-person references, preferring impersonal constructions.

### Characteristics of Informal Register

**Ellipsis and Fragments**: Informal speech omits elements that context makes clear—"Going to the shop?" rather than "Are you going to the shop?"

**Colloquial Vocabulary**: Everyday terms, slang, and idiomatic expressions characterise informal register.

**Personal Pronouns**: Informal speech frequently uses "I," "you," and "we" to establish interpersonal connection.

**Context-Dependent Meaning**: Informal speech relies heavily on shared context, gestures, and intonation to convey meaning.

**Interactive Features**: Questions, tag questions, and listener responses are integral to informal conversation.

### Teaching Register Flexibility

**Explicit Comparison**: Make formal and informal versions of the same content visible for comparison. pupils cannot learn what they cannot perceive.

**Context Analysis**: Teach pupils to analyse contexts— Who is the audience? What is the purpose? What is the setting?—to determine appropriate register.

**Code-Switching Practice**: Provide opportunities for pupils to translate the same content between registers, developing metalinguistic awareness.

**Respect for Both Registers**: Avoid positioning formal language as "better" or "correct" while informal language is "wrong." Both are appropriate in their contexts; the skill lies in matching register to situation.

**Home Language Validation**: For pupils who speak non-standard dialects or additional languages at home, explicitly validate their linguistic resources while teaching the additional register required for school success.

## Progression Across Key Stages

### Early Years Foundation Stage

In EYFS, speaking development focuses on building the foundations for all future purposes. Children should engage in "back-and-forth conversations" with adults and peers, learning the turn-taking that underlies all dialogue. Imaginative play provides natural contexts for adopting different voices and roles. Adults model variation between intimate conversation with individuals and group address.

### Key Stage 1 (Years 1-2)

Pupils begin to distinguish between speaking purposes explicitly. The curriculum requires them to "participate in discussions, presentations, performances, role play, improvisations and debates." Teachers introduce the concepts of audience and purpose in simplified form—"Who are we telling? What do we want them to know?"

### Key Stage 2 (Years 3-6)

KS2 develops greater specificity. By Year 5-6, pupils should "use appropriate tone, volume, and pace for different audiences and purposes" and "deliver structured presentations with confidence and clarity." Presentational talk becomes more extended; debates become more structured; the formal-informal distinction is explicitly taught.

Teaching Expertise guidance emphasises that KS2 pupils need "planned opportunities for speaking in a range of contexts, including: to different audiences, such as class, the teacher and other adults; with different levels of formality such as with peers, to another class, a whole-school assembly."

### Key Stage 3 (Years 7-9)

At KS3, the National Curriculum expects pupils to give "short speeches and presentations, expressing their own ideas and keeping to the point" and to participate in "formal debates and structured discussions." Register flexibility becomes more sophisticated as pupils encounter subject-specific discourses and academic registers across the curriculum.

### Key Stage 4 and Beyond

GCSE English Language assesses spoken language formally, requiring pupils to demonstrate presentational skills and participate in discussions. Beyond compulsory education, the ability to adapt speaking to purpose becomes increasingly important for employment, higher education, and civic participation.

## Common Misconceptions and Challenges

### Misconception: Confidence Equals Competence

Teachers often attribute speaking difficulties to lack of confidence while overlooking actual skill gaps. As Ofsted notes, pupils may lack "what they need to know about the topic under discussion to be able to form and articulate worthwhile contributions." Explicit teaching of content, structure, and register often addresses apparent confidence issues.

### Misconception: Formal Equals Better

Some pupils and teachers associate formality with quality, leading to artificially stilted speech or inappropriate register choices. Effective speakers match register to context, using informal language appropriately and formal language effectively.

### Challenge: The Oral-Written Boundary

Pupils sometimes struggle with the distinction between written and spoken registers, reading aloud from notes rather than genuinely presenting, or conversely writing essays in spoken language. Teachers should explicitly compare spoken and written versions of similar content.

### Challenge: Assessment Anxiety

Formal assessment of spoken language can increase anxiety and decrease performance. Building speaking competence through low-stakes, high-frequency opportunities before assessment contexts is essential.

### Challenge: Limited Exposure to Formal Contexts

Pupils from homes where formal register is rarely used may need more explicit instruction and more scaffolded practice to develop CALP. This is a matter of additional teaching, not deficit.

## Pedagogical Recommendations

### Create Purposeful Speaking Opportunities

Speaking should never be activity for its own sake. Every speaking task should have genuine purpose and audience—explaining to a peer, persuading the class, informing visitors, debating a genuine dilemma.

### Model Explicitly

Teachers should regularly model different speaking purposes, making their choices visible: "I'm shifting to a more formal register now because..." or "Notice how I'm structuring this presentation..."

### Build Talk-Rich Environments

The English curriculum establishes that pupils should "competent in the arts of speaking and listening, making formal presentations, demonstrating to others and participating in debate." This competence develops through regular, sustained opportunities rather than isolated speaking activities.

### Integrate Across the Curriculum

Speaking purposes should be practised across all subjects—explaining scientific processes, debating historical interpretations, presenting geographical findings—so pupils develop transferrable capabilities.

### Develop Metalinguistic Awareness

Teach pupils to notice and name linguistic choices: "That's formal register," "You're using rhetorical questions," "That's a strong rebuttal." Awareness enables intentional practice.

### Provide Specific Feedback

Generic praise ("Good speaking") is less useful than specific feedback addressing particular purposes and techniques. Pupils need to know what they did effectively and what they might develop further.

## Summary

Speaking for different purposes—presentational talk, performance, debate, and register-flexible communication—represents a core strand of the English curriculum and a fundamental life skill. Each purpose demands distinct linguistic features, organisational structures, and paralinguistic awareness.

Effective teaching makes these demands explicit, provides scaffolded practice across diverse contexts, and builds pupils' capacity to analyse situations and adapt their speaking accordingly. The goal is not to privilege formal over informal language, but to develop flexible competence—pupils who can speak confidently, appropriately, and effectively whatever the purpose, audience, or context.

As the English curriculum establishes, pupils should leave compulsory education "competent in the arts of speaking and listening, making formal presentations, demonstrating to others and participating in debate." Achieving this competence requires sustained, purposeful attention to speaking for different purposes throughout their schooling.
