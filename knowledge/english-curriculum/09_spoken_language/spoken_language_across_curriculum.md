# Spoken Language Across the Curriculum

## Introduction: Oracy as Educational Foundation

Spoken language is not merely a vehicle for learning—it *is* learning. In UK schools, the development of oracy (the ability to articulate ideas, develop understanding, and engage with others through oral language) has gained increasing recognition as foundational to educational success. While the National Curriculum for England enshrines spoken language as the first strand of English, its importance extends far beyond the English classroom. Effective oracy provision requires a whole-school commitment that recognises spoken language as a critical tool for thinking, learning, and participating in society across every subject domain.

This knowledge base explores the theoretical foundations of oracy, examines how spoken language functions across the curriculum beyond English lessons, presents progression frameworks for developing oracy skills, and offers practical guidance for implementation. Drawing on the work of leading researchers including Robin Alexander, Neil Mercer, and the Voice 21 oracy framework, this resource supports teachers and curriculum leaders in developing comprehensive spoken language provision that transforms pupil outcomes.

## Why Oracy Matters: The Research Base

### Cognitive and Academic Benefits

The evidence base for oracy education is substantial and growing. Research consistently demonstrates that talk-rich classrooms produce measurable gains in pupil achievement across multiple domains. The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) identifies collaborative learning approaches—which foreground spoken interaction—as high-impact, low-cost strategies with proven effectiveness.

Studies by Neil Mercer and colleagues at the University of Cambridge have established that children's attainment in core subjects improves significantly when teachers systematically develop their oracy skills. Mercer's research on "exploratory talk" demonstrates that when pupils learn to engage in reasoned dialogue—sharing ideas, challenging positions respectfully, building on others' contributions—they develop stronger reasoning abilities and deeper subject understanding.

Robin Alexander's extensive comparative research on teaching internationally revealed that dialogic teaching (characterised by genuine classroom dialogue rather than teacher-dominated recitation) correlates strongly with educational quality. His Five Principles of Dialogic Teaching—collective, reciprocal, supportive, cumulative, and purposeful—provide a framework for understanding how talk supports learning:

- **Collective:** Teachers and children address learning tasks together
- **Reciprocal:** Teachers and children listen to each other, share ideas, and consider alternative viewpoints
- **Supportive:** Children articulate ideas freely without fear of embarrassment
- **Cumulative:** Teachers and children build on their own and each other's contributions
- **Purposeful:** Teachers plan and steer classroom talk with specific educational goals in mind

### Social and Emotional Development

Beyond academic outcomes, oracy development supports pupils' social and emotional growth. The ability to communicate effectively, listen actively, and engage constructively with diverse perspectives underpins positive relationships and mental wellbeing. For pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, quality oracy provision can be particularly transformative, providing access to the linguistic codes and interaction patterns that facilitate social mobility.

The Oracy APPG (All-Party Parliamentary Group) inquiry into oracy education in 2021 highlighted that oracy is a social mobility issue. Children from wealthier backgrounds typically experience richer language environments at home, entering school with substantially larger vocabularies and more developed communication skills. Without systematic school-based oracy provision, these gaps persist and widen. Schools that prioritise oracy help level the playing field, ensuring all pupils develop the spoken language capabilities essential for success.

### Employability and Citizenship

The World Economic Forum consistently ranks communication among the top skills required for future employment. Yet employers frequently report that young people enter the workforce lacking confidence and competence in spoken communication. Schools have a responsibility to develop these capabilities intentionally, not incidentally.

Furthermore, effective oracy underpins democratic participation. The ability to articulate views, engage in reasoned debate, listen to alternative perspectives, and reach collective decisions is essential for active citizenship. In an era of polarised discourse and misinformation, teaching pupils to communicate constructively across difference represents a vital educational mission.

## Spoken Language Beyond English: A Whole-School Approach

### The Limitations of Siloed Oracy

Traditionally, spoken language development has been treated as primarily the responsibility of English departments. While English teachers certainly play a crucial role, this siloed approach fundamentally misunderstands how language functions in learning. Every subject discipline has its own ways of using spoken language—its own register, conventions, and characteristic patterns of discourse. Developing pupils' oracy means teaching them to communicate effectively across these disciplinary contexts.

The National Curriculum's programmes of study explicitly acknowledge this. The English curriculum states that "teachers should develop pupils' spoken language, reading, writing and vocabulary as integral aspects of the teaching of every subject." This is not merely cross-curricular aspiration but pedagogical necessity. Pupils cannot think historically, scientifically, or mathematically without learning to speak in historically, scientifically, and mathematically appropriate ways.

### Disciplinary Oracy: Subject-Specific Speaking

Each subject domain requires particular forms of spoken language use. Understanding these disciplinary literacies is essential for developing effective whole-school oracy provision.

**History** demands the ability to construct arguments from evidence, weigh interpretations, and engage with causal reasoning. Historical discussion involves debating significance, evaluating sources, and understanding how different perspectives shape accounts of the past. The vocabulary of history—including terms like "causation," "consequence," "continuity," and "change"—must be deployed with precision in spoken discourse.

**Science** requires pupils to hypothesise, observe, explain phenomena, and evaluate evidence. Scientific talk involves proposing theories, designing investigations, and reporting findings. The ability to articulate scientific reasoning—to explain *why* something happens, not merely *that* it happens—is central to developing scientific understanding. Science talk also involves particular conventions: precise use of technical vocabulary, conditional language ("this suggests," "the evidence indicates"), and the distinction between observation and inference.

**Mathematics** involves explaining mathematical thinking, justifying strategies, and exploring patterns. Mathematical discourse requires moving between concrete, pictorial, and abstract representations while articulating the connections between them. Pupils must learn to present proofs, explain procedures, and critique reasoning. The spoken language of mathematics includes specialised terms but also particular ways of structuring explanations and arguments.

**Geography** combines empirical description with theoretical analysis, requiring pupils to discuss spatial patterns, human-environment interactions, and complex systems. Geographical talk involves interpreting visual data, debating sustainability issues, and understanding diverse perspectives on global challenges.

**Modern Foreign Languages** foreground spoken interaction as both medium and object of study. The communicative competence central to MFL pedagogy involves developing practical spoken proficiency while simultaneously developing metalinguistic awareness of how language functions in interaction.

### Integrating Oracy Across the Curriculum

Effective whole-school oracy provision requires coordinated approaches that support both generic communication skills and subject-specific discourse. Several strategies support this integration:

**Shared Vocabulary and Expectations:** Schools should establish common language for talking about talk. Terms like "active listening," "building on others' ideas," "challenging respectfully," and "providing evidence" can be used consistently across subjects while being applied in discipline-appropriate ways.

**Cross-Departmental Collaboration:** English and drama specialists can share expertise in developing spoken language with colleagues across the curriculum. Subject teachers can identify the particular forms of talk most relevant to their domains and receive support in scaffolding these effectively.

**Assessment Alignment:** When oracy is assessed only in English, the message that it matters elsewhere is undermined. Consideration should be given to how spoken language features in assessment across subjects—not necessarily through formal speaking grades, but through valuing contribution quality, reasoning, and collaborative engagement.

**Professional Development:** All teachers benefit from understanding how talk supports learning in their subjects. Professional development should address both the generic principles of dialogic teaching and the specific discourse demands of particular disciplines.

## The National Curriculum Framework for Spoken Language

### Statutory Requirements

The National Curriculum for England establishes spoken language as a foundational element running through all programmes of study. The statutory requirements outline clear expectations while providing flexibility for schools in implementation.

**Key Stage 1:** Pupils should be taught to:
- Listen and respond appropriately to adults and peers
- Ask relevant questions to extend understanding and knowledge
- Use relevant strategies to build vocabulary
- Articulate and justify answers, arguments, and opinions
- Give well-structured descriptions, explanations, and narratives
- Participate actively in collaborative conversations
- Use spoken language to develop understanding through speculating, hypothesising, imagining, and exploring ideas
- Speak audibly and fluently with an increasing command of Standard English
- Participate in discussions, presentations, performances, role play, improvisations, and debates

**Key Stage 2:** Building on these foundations, pupils should continue to develop their skills, with increasing emphasis on:
- Selecting and using appropriate registers for effective communication
- Gaining, maintaining, and monitoring the interest of listeners
- Considering and evaluating different viewpoints
- Attending to and building on the contributions of others

**Key Stage 3 and 4:** At secondary level, pupils should be taught to:
- Use discussion to probe and develop understanding
- Express ideas and opinions clearly, fluently, and at appropriate length
- Participate in formal debates and structured discussions
- Listen to and build on the contributions of others, asking questions to clarify and inform
- Adapt speech to a widening range of circumstances and demands

### Assessment of Spoken Language

Since 2016, statutory assessment of spoken language has been through teacher assessment only, with a pass/merit/distinction scale at GCSE. While this reduces high-stakes pressure, it requires schools to maintain robust approaches to assessing spoken language development without external moderation.

Effective assessment of oracy involves both formative and summative elements. Formative assessment happens continuously as teachers observe pupils' contributions, provide feedback, and adjust teaching. Summative assessment provides snapshots of achievement against clear criteria. The Voice 21 framework offers detailed guidance on assessing oracy across four strands: physical (voice and body language), linguistic (vocabulary and language variety), cognitive (content and structure), and social and emotional (listening and collaboration).

## The Voice 21 Oracy Framework: A Comprehensive Progression Model

Voice 21, the UK's leading oracy education organisation, has developed a comprehensive framework that supports schools in implementing systematic oracy provision. Their model provides detailed progression across four interrelated strands, offering teachers practical guidance for developing pupils' spoken language capabilities from early years through to sixth form.

### The Four Strands of Oracy

**Physical Strand:** This encompasses the technical elements of effective spoken delivery. It includes:
- Voice: volume, pace, pitch, tone, intonation, clarity, and articulation
- Body language: posture, gesture, eye contact, facial expression, and positioning

Progression in the physical strand moves from basic audibility and presence in early years to sophisticated control of vocal variety and non-verbal communication in later key stages. By upper secondary, pupils should be able to modulate their delivery for different contexts, using voice and body language deliberately to engage audiences and convey meaning.

**Linguistic Strand:** This covers the vocabulary, grammar, and rhetorical devices pupils command. It includes:
- Vocabulary breadth and precision
- Register: adapting language for different contexts and audiences
- Rhetorical devices: rhetorical questions, repetition, figurative language
- Cohesion and coherence in extended discourse

Development in this strand involves expanding vocabulary, mastering increasingly complex grammatical structures, and learning to select language appropriate to context. Pupils progress from using simple, concrete vocabulary to deploying abstract concepts and technical terminology with precision.

**Cognitive Strand:** This addresses the thinking that underlies effective speaking. It includes:
- Content: knowledge, ideas, examples, and evidence
- Structure: organisation, sequencing, and signposting
- Reasoning: explaining, justifying, and analysing
- Questioning: asking productive questions

The cognitive strand recognises that quality talk requires quality thinking. Progression involves moving from simple description to explanation, from unsupported opinion to evidence-based argument, from disjointed contributions to well-structured discourse. By Key Stage 4, pupils should be constructing extended arguments with clear reasoning and appropriate evidence.

**Social and Emotional Strand:** This encompasses the interpersonal dimensions of communication. It includes:
- Listening: active attention, seeking clarification, responding to others
- Collaboration: building on contributions, managing disagreement, reaching consensus
- Empathy: recognising others' perspectives and emotions
- Confidence: managing anxiety and speaking with assurance

Development in this strand involves becoming increasingly skilled at participating in collaborative dialogue, managing the dynamics of group interaction, and showing awareness of others' viewpoints and feelings.

### Using the Framework for Progression Planning

The Voice 21 framework provides detailed descriptors for each strand across developmental phases (roughly corresponding to key stages). Schools can use these to:

- **Map current provision:** Assessing where existing practice supports oracy development and where gaps exist
- **Plan progression:** Ensuring that oracy demands increase appropriately as pupils move through the school
- **Differentiate support:** Identifying where individuals or groups need additional scaffolding or challenge
- **Assess achievement:** Providing criteria against which to evaluate spoken language performance

## Developing Oracy: Pedagogical Approaches

### Dialogic Teaching

Robin Alexander's dialogic teaching approach provides a comprehensive framework for classroom interaction that maximises learning through talk. At its core is the recognition that the traditional Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) pattern, while efficient for checking recall, severely limits opportunities for extended thinking and dialogue.

Dialogic teaching transforms classroom discourse by:

**Using Questions Purposefully:** Teachers move beyond factual recall questions to probe thinking, invite elaboration, and challenge assumptions. Open questions that invite multiple perspectives replace closed questions with single correct answers.

**Building on Contributions:** Rather than evaluating each pupil response immediately and moving on, teachers help pupils connect contributions, creating cumulative chains of thinking. One pupil's idea becomes the foundation for another's contribution.

**Structuring Participation:** Dialogic classrooms ensure broad participation, using strategies like think-pair-share, snowballing discussions, and structured group work to ensure all pupils engage, not just confident volunteers.

**Maintaining Coherence:** While dialogic teaching embraces the exploratory and sometimes messy nature of genuine dialogue, effective teachers maintain focus on learning objectives, guiding discussion productively.

### Oracy Strategies for the Classroom

Numerous practical strategies support oracy development across subjects:

**Think-Pair-Share:** Before whole-class discussion, pupils think individually, then discuss with a partner. This ensures all pupils engage with ideas and rehearse contributions before speaking publicly.

**Snowballing:** Pupils begin individually, then pair to share ideas, then join another pair to form fours, then eights. This builds confidence while generating rich collaborative thinking.

**Conscience Alley:** Pupils form two lines representing different perspectives on a dilemma, articulating arguments as someone walks between them. Excellent for exploring ethical issues or character motivations.

**Debate and Structured Argument:** Formal debates develop structured reasoning and evidence use. The four corners strategy (where pupils move to corners representing positions on a statement) gets all pupils physically engaged in taking and defending positions.

**Hot-Seating:** One pupil takes on a role (historical figure, literary character, expert) and answers questions from classmates. Develops empathy, subject knowledge, and improvisation skills.

**Philosophy for Children (P4C):** Community of Inquiry approaches develop collaborative philosophical dialogue, teaching pupils to question assumptions, build on ideas, and explore concepts deeply.

### Scaffolding Oracy Development

Effective oracy teaching provides appropriate scaffolding that enables all pupils to participate successfully. This includes:

**Language Frames:** Providing sentence starters that model academic discourse. "I agree with X because...", "An alternative perspective is...", "The evidence suggests..." These support pupils in adopting more sophisticated forms of expression.

**Visual Supports:** Graphic organisers, discussion diamonds, and talking towers provide visual structures that support spoken organisation of ideas.

**Preparation Time:** Giving thinking time before speaking benefits all pupils but particularly supports those who process more slowly or lack confidence.

**Modelling:** Teachers modelling the forms of talk they want pupils to use—thinking aloud, demonstrating exploratory talk, showing how to build on contributions.

## Implementing Oracy: Leadership and Whole-School Development

### Creating an Oracy-Rich Culture

Sustainable oracy improvement requires whole-school commitment. Key elements include:

**Vision and Policy:** Clear statement of oracy's importance, shared understanding of what oracy means in the school context, and explicit commitment to developing spoken language across the curriculum.

**Leadership Structure:** Designated oracy lead with time and authority to drive development, plus distributed leadership with subject champions supporting disciplinary oracy.

**Professional Learning:** Ongoing professional development that builds teacher knowledge and skill in dialogic teaching and subject-specific oracy development.

**Environment:** Physical spaces that support talk (flexible seating, spaces for group work), display that celebrates talk, and scheduling that allows extended discussion.

### Monitoring and Evaluation

Effective oracy development requires systematic monitoring:

**Lesson Observation:** Looking for dialogic teaching features, pupil participation patterns, and oracy skill development.

**Pupil Voice:** Gathering pupils' perspectives on their oracy experiences, confidence, and perceived development.

**Assessment Data:** Tracking oracy assessment outcomes and examining how oracy development correlates with broader achievement.

**Portfolio Approaches:** Recording and reflecting on examples of pupil talk over time to demonstrate progression.

### Addressing Barriers

Common barriers to oracy development include:

**Curriculum Pressure:** The perception that talk takes time away from covering content. Addressing this requires demonstrating how talk deepens and accelerates learning.

**Teacher Confidence:** Some teachers lack confidence in their own oracy skills or in facilitating discussions. Professional development and collaborative practice help build capability.

**Dominant Pupils:** Some pupils monopolise discussion while others remain silent. Structured participation strategies and explicit teaching of turn-taking help ensure equitable participation.

**Assessment Challenges:** The difficulty of assessing spoken language reliably. Using clear frameworks, multiple assessment opportunities, and moderation processes supports robust assessment.

## Conclusion

Spoken language across the curriculum represents far more than an adjunct to reading and writing. Oracy is a fundamental entitlement for every pupil—a capability that opens doors to academic success, social mobility, and active citizenship. Developing oracy requires schools to move beyond tokenistic gestures toward systematic, intentional provision that recognises the distinctive demands of disciplinary discourse while building generic communication capabilities.

The frameworks and approaches outlined in this knowledge base—from Robin Alexander's dialogic teaching principles to Voice 21's comprehensive progression model—provide practical guidance for this work. Yet ultimately, oracy development is not about implementing programmes but about transforming relationships: between teachers and pupils, between pupils and knowledge, and among pupils themselves. When classrooms become genuinely dialogic spaces, where every voice is valued and every contribution builds collective understanding, the
transformative potential of education is realised.

As the Oracy APPG recommended, oracy should be given the same status as reading and writing in the curriculum and in school accountability measures. This recognition would reflect the reality that spoken language development is not optional enrichment but fundamental entitlement. Schools that embrace this challenge—developing rich, dialogic, subject-specific talk across the curriculum—will prepare pupils not merely for examination success but for life as confident, articulate, engaged citizens capable of shaping the world through their voices.

## Key Takeaways for Teachers

1. **Oracy is foundational:** Spoken language development underpins success across all subjects and beyond school.

2. **Whole-school commitment required:** Oracy cannot be left to English teachers alone; every subject has distinctive discourse demands.

3. **Use frameworks:** The Voice 21 four-strand model and Alexander's dialogic teaching principles provide practical guidance.

4. **Structure matters:** Strategies like think-pair-share, snowballing, and debate ensure all pupils participate and develop.

5. **Assessment drives priority:** When oracy is assessed and valued, it receives appropriate attention in teaching.

6. **Leadership is essential:** Sustainable improvement requires designated leadership, professional development, and whole-school policy.

7. **Relationships transform:** Ultimately, oracy development changes relationships—between teachers and pupils, pupils and knowledge, and among pupils themselves.
