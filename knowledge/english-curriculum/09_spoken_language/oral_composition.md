# Oral Composition: Speaking Before Writing in the English Curriculum

## Introduction

Oral composition—the practice of using spoken language as a bridge to written composition—is a pedagogical approach that recognises the fundamental relationship between thought, speech, and writing. In UK English education, this approach is grounded in research demonstrating that articulate writing emerges from articulate talk. The National Curriculum for English (2014) establishes spoken language as one of the foundational pillars of English education, noting that pupils' spoken language underpins and informs the development of reading and writing.

This knowledge file explores the theoretical foundations, practical applications, and pedagogical strategies for developing oral composition skills across the primary and secondary phases. It draws upon the Oracy Commission's work, Voice 21's extensive research programme, the Education Endowment Foundation's evidence reviews, and established practice in English teaching from the Early Years Foundation Stage through to GCSE.

## Theoretical Foundations

### The Relationship Between Oral and Written Language

The developmental trajectory of language acquisition reveals a clear progression: children become competent speakers of their first language before they encounter written forms. This natural sequence—listening, speaking, reading, writing—has profound implications for pedagogy. The linguist James Britton (1970) established that "writing floats on a sea of talk," emphasising that written composition is essentially talk captured and refined. Britton's work demonstrated that pupils who engage in extended discussion before writing produce texts of greater syntactic complexity and organisational coherence.

The principle of oracy preceding literacy is now well-established in educational research. The Cambridge Primary Review (Alexander, 2010) identified oral development as the foundation upon which all subsequent literacy skills are built. The review noted that in classrooms where talk was prioritised, pupils demonstrated improved performance across all areas of English, including written composition.

### Cognitive Load and Composition

Contemporary cognitive load theory (Sweller, 2011) provides further support for oral composition approaches. When pupils are asked to compose in writing, they must simultaneously manage multiple cognitive demands: generating ideas, organising content, selecting vocabulary, applying grammatical conventions, and attending to transcription (spelling, handwriting, typing). For developing writers, these simultaneous demands often exceed working memory capacity, resulting in simplified and fragmented texts.

Oral composition reduces this cognitive burden by separating the generation and organisation of ideas from the transcription process. When pupils articulate their thinking aloud—whether to a partner, small group, or the whole class—they can focus on the semantic and structural aspects of composition without the additional demands of encoding written language. The Education Endowment Foundation's (2019) evidence review on writing found strong evidence that oral rehearsal strategies produced an average positive effect size of +0.46 on writing outcomes.

### Sociocultural Perspectives

Vygotsky's sociocultural theory (1978) emphasises the role of social interaction in cognitive development. From this perspective, talk is not merely a means of expressing pre-formed thoughts but a tool for thinking itself. The act of articulating ideas to others forces clarification, elaboration, and refinement. Neil Mercer's work on Exploratory Talk (Mercer and Littleton, 2007) demonstrates how structured dialogue enables pupils to co-construct understanding and develop more sophisticated arguments than individuals could achieve alone.

In the context of composition, this sociocultural perspective suggests that writing should be a social as well as an individual process. Pupils benefit from talking through their ideas with peers, receiving feedback, and revising their thinking before committing to written form. The Writing Is Primary initiative (2008-2011) found that classrooms implementing talk-rich approaches to writing demonstrated measurable improvements in both the quality and quantity of pupil writing.

## The National Curriculum Framework

### Statutory Requirements

The National Curriculum for English (2014) establishes spoken language as a statutory programme of study for all year groups from Year 1 through Year 9. The curriculum explicitly recognises that pupils' spoken language abilities precede and underpin their development of reading and writing. The programme of study requires that pupils be taught to:

- Articulate and justify answers, arguments and opinions
- Participate in discussions, presentations, performances, role play, improvisations and debates
- Gain, maintain and monitor the interest of the listener(s)
- Consider and evaluate different viewpoints, attending to and building on the contributions of others
- Select and use appropriate registers for effective communication

These statutory requirements provide the foundation for oral composition work, establishing that spoken language development is not merely preparatory to writing but an essential component of English education in its own right.

### Progression Across Key Stages

#### Early Years Foundation Stage

In the EYFS, communication and language is one of the three prime areas of learning. The Early Learning Goals specify that by the end of Reception, children should be able to express their ideas and feelings using full sentences, including use of past, present and future tenses. The Development Matters guidance (2021) emphasises the importance of adults modelling language and providing opportunities for children to engage in extended conversations.

For oral composition, the EYFS practitioner creates contexts where children verbalise their intentions before mark-making or emergent writing. Story scribing—where adults write down children's dictated stories verbatim—is a well-established practice that demonstrates the relationship between oral and written language. The work of Vivian Gussin Paley (1990) on storytelling and story acting in early years settings provides a powerful model for valuing children's oral narratives as legitimate forms of composition.

#### Key Stage 1 (Years 1-2)

As pupils enter Key Stage 1, the balance gradually shifts towards more structured approaches to oral composition. Year 1 pupils are expected to participate in discussion about what they are going to write, articulating their ideas before beginning the writing process. By Year 2, pupils should be rehearsing sentences orally before writing them down, and sequencing sentences to form short narratives.

The grammar and punctuation programme of study at Key Stage 1 emphasises oral rehearsal as a means of developing syntactical awareness. Pupils learn to recognise sentence boundaries partly through saying sentences aloud and recognising where natural pauses and inflections occur. The use of sentence stems and oral cloze procedures supports pupils in internalising grammatical structures before applying them independently.

#### Key Stage 2 (Years 3-6)\n
The Key Stage 2 programme of study increasingly emphasises composition as a multi-stage process. Pupils are expected to plan their writing by discussing and recording ideas, draft and write by composing sentences orally before writing them, and evaluate and edit by assessing the effectiveness of their writing. The progression is from oral planning towards greater independence, with the spoken word remaining a constant reference point throughout the process.

By upper Key Stage 2, pupils should be using a wider range of oral composition strategies, including formal presentations, debates, and structured discussions. The curriculum recognises that different text types require different approaches: the oral rehearsal of an argument differs from the oral exploration of a narrative. Pupils learn to match their oral preparation to the demands of the writing task.

#### Key Stage 3 (Years 7-9)

At Key Stage 3, the spoken language programme of study requires pupils to use discussion to elaborate and explain their understanding and ideas. The curriculum explicitly links spoken and written forms, expecting pupils to be competent in using standard English confidently in a range of formal and informal contexts. Oral composition at this phase involves more sophisticated rhetorical awareness: pupils learn to consider audience, purpose, and register in both spoken and written forms.

The Key Stage 3 curriculum preparation for GCSE English Language, where spoken language is assessed through a formal presentation, provides an opportunity to consolidate oral composition skills. The requirement to present information and ideas, selecting and organising content effectively, and responding to questions from the audience mirrors the processes involved in effective written composition.

#### Key Stage 4 (GCSE)

GCSE English Language specifications include a Spoken Language endorsement (formerly speaking and listening) that requires pupils to deliver a formal presentation on a topic of their choice. While this is separately endorsed and does not contribute to the 9-1 grade, it represents the culmination of oral composition development through the secondary phase.

More significantly, GCSE English Language assessment of writing rewards the same skills developed through oral composition: clear organisation, effective use of vocabulary, awareness of audience, and control of sentence structure. Pupils who have developed strong oral composition skills throughout their schooling are better prepared for the demands of timed written examinations.

## Pedagogical Approaches to Oral Composition

### Talk for Writing

Pie Corbett's Talk for Writing approach (2008) provides a comprehensive framework for using oral rehearsal as a foundation for writing. The approach is structured in three phases: Imitation, Innovation, and Invention. In the Imitation phase, pupils internalise model texts through repeated oral rehearsal, using actions and story maps to embed language patterns. The Innovation phase involves guided composition, where pupils adapt the model text through structured oral work before writing. The Invention phase sees pupils applying what they have internalised to create original compositions.

The key insight of Talk for Writing is that pupils cannot write what they cannot say. The approach emphasises the importance of shared writing as a bridge between oral and written composition: the teacher models the composition process aloud, articulating decision-making and demonstrating how spoken language is transformed into written form. This modelling makes the writing process visible and provides a template for pupils' independent composition.

Research on Talk for Writing (Myhill, 2012; DCSF, 2008) has demonstrated significant positive effects on writing outcomes, particularly for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. The approach is now widely implemented in primary schools and increasingly adapted for secondary contexts.

### The Oracy Framework

Voice 21 and the University of Cambridge's Oracy Framework (2016) provides a structured approach to developing oracy across four strands: physical, linguistic, cognitive, and social and emotional. While the framework addresses oracy broadly, its principles are directly applicable to oral composition.

The linguistic strand is particularly relevant, focusing on developing pupils' ability to choose and use appropriate vocabulary, structure sentences effectively, and build coherent narratives and arguments. The cognitive strand addresses the thinking skills that underpin composition: reasoning, summarising, speculating, and evaluating.

Schools implementing the Oracy Framework report improvements not only in spoken language but also in written composition. The 2021 Oracy All-Party Parliamentary Group report highlighted that oracy education leads to improved writing outcomes, with pupils better able to structure their writing and select appropriate vocabulary after engaging in structured talk activities.

### Reciprocal Teaching

Reciprocal teaching (Palincsar and Brown, 1984) is a structured approach to developing comprehension through dialogue that has significant applications for oral composition. The approach involves pupils taking on teacher-like roles—questioning, clarifying, summarising, and predicting—in guided reading sessions. These same strategies support oral composition: questioning helps pupils interrogate their ideas, clarifying forces precision in expression, summarising develops concision, and predicting supports narrative planning.

Adaptations of reciprocal teaching for composition (Graham and Perin, 2007) demonstrate how structured peer dialogue can support the writing process. Pupils working in pairs take turns articulating their compositions aloud while their partner questions, clarifies, and suggests improvements. This collaborative approach to composition recognises that writing benefits from the social processes of drafting and revision.

### Philosophy for Children (P4C)

Philosophy for Children (Lipman, 2003) is an approach that uses structured philosophical enquiry to develop thinking and communication skills. In P4C sessions, pupils engage in sustained dialogue about philosophical questions, learning to build on others' contributions, challenge assumptions, and develop reasoned arguments.

The relevance to oral composition lies in P4C's emphasis on rigorous thinking as the foundation for articulate expression. Pupils learn that composition—whether spoken or written—requires careful consideration of concepts, logical organisation of ideas, and precise use of language. The SAPERE organisation, which promotes P4C in UK schools, reports that regular P4C sessions lead to improvements in both oral and written reasoning.

## Practical Strategies for the Classroom

### Sentence-Level Rehearsal

#### Say It Before You Write It

The foundational strategy for oral composition is requiring pupils to articulate sentences aloud before writing them down. This can be implemented as a classroom routine: before beginning independent writing, pupils turn to a partner and say the opening sentence of their composition. This simple practice reduces the cognitive load of simultaneous generation and transcription and produces writing of greater syntactic sophistication.

For younger pupils, this might involve saying each sentence before writing it. For older pupils, the rehearsal might focus on key sentences—openings, transitions, conclusions—or on particularly complex syntactical constructions. The principle remains consistent: oral articulation precedes and informs written composition.

#### Sentence Stem Scaffolds

Sentence stems provide linguistic scaffolds that support pupils in generating grammatically complex utterances. Stems such as "Although...", "Despite the fact that...", or "One explanation for this is..." provide structures that pupils complete with their own content. Through repeated oral use, these structures become internalised and available for independent written composition.

The use of sentence stems should be purposeful and linked to the linguistic demands of the specific writing task. A persuasive writing unit might focus on stems for presenting arguments and counter-arguments; an explanatory text might emphasise causal and sequential structures. Pupils should practise stems orally in pairs before applying them in writing.

#### Oral Expansion and Elaboration

Pupils often produce simple sentences that could be expanded with greater detail and precision. The oral expansion strategy involves taking a basic sentence—"The dog ran"—and collaboratively expanding it through questioning: "What kind of dog?" "Where did it run?" "Why was it running?" "How did it run?" The expanded sentence—"The scruffy terrier ran frantically across the muddy field, desperate to escape the approaching storm"—demonstrates the potential of oral elaboration.

This strategy develops pupils' awareness of how additional information can be incorporated through noun phrase expansion, adverbials, and subordinate clauses. It can be implemented as a whole-class activity, in pairs, or as an independent oral rehearsal strategy.

### Text-Level Rehearsal

#### Storytelling and Narrative Composition

Before writing stories, pupils benefit from extensive oral storytelling. This might involve telling stories to partners, performing stories to the class, or recording oral stories using technology. The oral telling allows pupils to work out narrative structure, experiment with language, and gauge audience response before committing to written form.

The traditional art of oral storytelling—preserved in cultures worldwide—provides a model for narrative composition. Storytellers do not memorise scripts but internalise narrative structures and language patterns that they adapt for each performance. This improvisation-within-structure is precisely the skill required for written narrative composition.

#### Argument Rehearsal Through Debate

Before writing arguments, pupils benefit from formal debate. The adversarial structure of debate forces clarity of position, logical organisation of supporting evidence, and anticipation of counter-arguments. Pupils who have argued a position orally are better prepared to write persuasively about it.

Debate formats can be adapted for different age groups and contexts: formal parliamentary-style debates, four-corner debates where pupils physically move to indicate their position, or structured discussions using talking sticks to manage turn-taking. The key is that oral argument precedes written argument.

#### Collaborative Composition

Collaborative composition involves groups of pupils composing texts together through structured dialogue. One pupil might act as scribe while others contribute ideas, or the group might compose orally with the teacher or a pupil transcribing. The process forces explicit discussion of compositional choices: "Should we start with description or action?" "Would 'crept' or 'stalked' work better here?"

The Writing Together research project (Barrs and Cork, 2001) demonstrated the potential of collaborative composition for developing both individual writing skills and understanding of writing as a social practice. The talk generated during collaborative composition reveals the thinking processes underlying effective writing.

### Rehearsal and Revision Strategies

#### The ROAM Framework

The ROAM framework (Read, Oral rehearsal, Amend, Monitor) structures the revision process to include deliberate oral rehearsal. After drafting, pupils read their writing aloud—to themselves, to a partner, or into a recording device. The oral reading reveals issues that silent reading might miss: awkward phrasing, missing words, unclear organisation. Pupils make amendments based on what they notice during oral rehearsal and monitor the effectiveness of their revisions by reading again.

This framework makes revision an active, oral process rather than a passive, silent one. It develops pupils' internal ear for written language, enabling them to hear how their writing sounds and make adjustments accordingly.

#### Paired Oral Rehearsal

Paired oral rehearsal involves pupils taking turns to read their drafts aloud while their partner listens and provides feedback. The listener's role is to identify where the writing is unclear or where further detail is needed, not to correct spelling or punctuation. The focus remains on composition—the creation and organisation of meaning—rather than transcription.

The feedback format should be structured: "I was confused when...", "I wanted to know more about...", "The part where... was particularly effective." This structure supports constructive critique and models the kind of revision thinking that effective writers engage in.

#### Audio Recording and Playback

Recording devices—whether dedicated voice recorders, tablet apps, or mobile phones—provide opportunities for pupils to rehearse their compositions and listen back to them. Hearing their own voice can help pupils identify areas for improvement that they might miss when reading silently. It also provides a record of oral composition that can be compared with the final written version.

The process of recording, listening, and revising supports the development of metacognitive awareness about composition. Pupils become conscious of their compositional choices and develop an understanding of how oral and written forms differ.

## Developing Sentence Structure Through Talk

### From Speech to Writing

Spoken and written language differ in significant ways. Speech is typically more fragmented, includes more repetition and self-correction, and relies on paralinguistic features (tone, gesture, facial expression) for meaning. Writing is more explicitly structured, more lexically dense, and must convey meaning through linguistic resources alone. The transition from speech to writing requires pupils to develop control over written language structures.

Oral composition bridges this gap by allowing pupils to use the fluency of spoken language while developing awareness of how written structures differ. Through guided oral work, pupils can experiment with increasingly complex sentence structures before being required to produce them in writing.

### Modelling Complex Syntax Orally

One of the most effective ways to develop pupils' written syntax is through oral modelling of complex structures. When teachers deliberately use sophisticated sentence structures in their own speech—compound-complex sentences, embedded clauses, and varied sentence openings—they provide implicit models that pupils gradually internalise. This modelling is particularly effective when teachers make their language choices explicit: "I've used an embedded clause here to add extra information without starting a new sentence."

Oral cloze procedures support this development: the teacher provides a sentence frame with gaps for pupils to complete orally. For example: "Despite the heavy rain, which __________, the team __________." Pupils suggest various completions, experimenting with different syntactic possibilities before selecting the most effective for their written composition.

### Developing Subordination Through Talk

Subordination—the use of dependent clauses to indicate relationships between ideas—is a hallmark of mature writing. However, subordination can be challenging for developing writers, who tend to produce strings of simple sentences or compound sentences joined only by "and." Oral work provides a low-stakes context for developing subordination skills.

Activities such as "If... then..." chains, "Although..." exchanges, and "Because..." explanations develop pupils' capacity to articulate complex relationships orally before applying them in writing. When pupils can fluently produce subordinated constructions in speech, they are more likely to use them effectively in their writing.

### From Coordinating to Subordinating Conjunctions

The development of conjunction use follows a predictable pattern: pupils begin with coordinating conjunctions (and, but, so, or) and gradually acquire subordinating conjunctions (although, because, while, unless, if). Oral composition activities can accelerate this progression by drawing attention to the rhetorical effects of different conjunctions.

The "Conjunction Challenge" activity involves giving pupils a simple sentence and challenging them to link it to another sentence using a specific subordinating conjunction. For example: "The game was cancelled. The weather was terrible." Pupils might produce: "The game was cancelled because the weather was terrible" or "Although the weather was terrible, the game was not cancelled." This oral experimentation develops syntactic flexibility that transfers to written composition.

## Articulation and Precision in Expression

### The Importance of Precise Vocabulary

Oral composition provides an ideal context for developing vocabulary precision. When pupils speak, they can receive immediate feedback on whether their word choices convey the intended meaning. The listener's puzzled expression or request for clarification signals that more precise vocabulary is needed. This immediate feedback loop supports rapid vocabulary development.

The "Say it Better" strategy involves pupils articulating their ideas using whatever vocabulary comes naturally, then working with a partner or the teacher to identify more precise alternatives. "The man walked slowly" might become "The man trudged wearily" or "The man crept cautiously." This oral thesaurus work develops the habit of attending to word choice before writing.

### Register and Audience Awareness

Different contexts require different levels of formality, and oral composition provides opportunities to explore register variation. Pupils might practise telling the same story to a friend (informal), a teacher (more formal), or a school assembly (formal). This practice develops awareness of how vocabulary, syntax, and tone shift according to audience.

The concept of register is often more accessible when explored orally first. Pupils can hear the differences between "The King's dead" (informal), "The King has passed away" (euphemistic), and "His Majesty has passed" (formal). This oral exploration establishes the foundation for register-appropriate writing.

### Eliminating Vagueness

Vague expression—using words like "thing," "stuff," "nice," "bad"—is common in both speech and early writing. Oral composition activities can target this vagueness by refusing to accept it. When a pupil says "It was a nice day," the teacher or partner responds with "What do you mean by 'nice'?" This prompts elaboration: "The sun was shining and it was warm enough to sit outside."

The "No Vague Words" game challenges pupils to express themselves without using designated vague terms. This constraint forces precision and develops the habit of specific expression that carries over into writing.

## Supporting Diverse Learners

### Pupils with English as an Additional Language

For pupils learning English as an additional language (EAL), oral composition is doubly important. These pupils may have well-developed composition skills in their first language but lack the linguistic resources to express those ideas in English. Oral composition provides a bridge: pupils can draw upon their full cognitive capabilities while developing the specific linguistic resources needed for English writing.

The distinction between BICS (Basic Interpersonal Communicative Skills) and CALP (Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency) is relevant here. EAL pupils may develop conversational fluency relatively quickly but need extended time and support to develop the academic language required for composition. Oral composition activities that explicitly target academic language—formal presentation, structured argument, academic register—support this development.

### Pupils with Speech, Language and Communication Needs

Pupils with speech, language and communication needs (SLCN) may struggle with the oral aspects of oral composition. For these pupils, additional scaffolding is required. Visual supports such as story maps, writing frames, and graphic organisers provide alternative ways to plan and structure composition. Assistive technology—including voice recognition software and text-to-speech tools—can support the oral-to-written transition.

It is important to note that while some pupils with SLCN have difficulty with oral expression, their cognitive capabilities for composition may be intact. Alternative means of accessing the composition process—such as drawing, gesture, or visual planning—should be provided. The principle of articulating before writing remains valid, even when articulation takes non-verbal forms.

### Pupils with Dyslexia

For pupils with dyslexia, the transcription component of writing can be particularly demanding. Oral composition removes this barrier, allowing pupils to focus on the creative and organisational aspects of writing without the interference of spelling and handwriting difficulties. Dictation software has made this approach more practical, allowing pupils to compose orally and see their words transcribed immediately.

The cumulative cognitive load of dyslexia—simultaneously managing composition, spelling, handwriting, and working memory—makes oral rehearsal particularly valuable. When pupils with dyslexia have opportunities to articulate their ideas fully before writing, the resulting texts demonstrate greater syntactic complexity and more sophisticated vocabulary than those produced without oral rehearsal.

## Assessment of Oral Composition

### Formative Assessment Through Observation

The most common form of assessment for oral composition is teacher observation during classroom activities. Teachers can gather significant assessment information by circulating during paired talk activities, listening to pupils' oral rehearsals, and noting the quality of their contributions to collaborative composition.

Assessment focuses on the compositional aspects of oral language: the ability to organise ideas coherently, use appropriate vocabulary, vary sentence structure, and adapt to audience. These are the same competencies assessed in written composition, but observed through a different medium.

### Audio and Video Recording

Recording devices enable more systematic assessment of oral composition. Pupils can be recorded during planned oral composition activities, and the recordings reviewed to assess progress over time. This is particularly valuable for pupils whose oral contributions in whole-class contexts may be limited by confidence or by the pace of discussion.

Video recording adds the dimension of non-verbal communication, allowing assessment of how gesture, facial expression, and body language support or detract from the compositional message. This is particularly relevant for presentations and formal speeches.

### Self and Peer Assessment

Pupils can be taught to assess their own and others' oral compositions using criteria that parallel those used for written work. Has the speaker organised their ideas clearly? Have they used precise vocabulary? Have they engaged the listener's interest? This metacognitive awareness supports both oral and written development.

Self-assessment of oral rehearsal can be particularly powerful: pupils listen to recordings of their own oral compositions and identify areas for improvement before producing the written version. This reflective practice develops the internal monitoring that characterises skilled composers.

## Integration with the Wider Curriculum

### Cross-Curricular Applications

Oral composition is not limited to English lessons. The skills developed through oral rehearsal transfer across the curriculum: pupils who can articulate their understanding of a historical event are better prepared to write about it; pupils who can explain a scientific process orally can write clearer explanations. Cross-curricular oral composition should be encouraged and supported.

Subject-specific vocabulary and discourse patterns can be developed through oral rehearsal in context. In history, pupils might rehearse causal explanations; in science, they might practise describing procedures and explaining results; in geography, they might develop descriptions of places and processes. These subject-specific oral compositions provide the foundation for academic writing across the curriculum.

### Speaking and Listening Assessments

The spoken language endorsement at GCSE requires pupils to deliver a formal presentation and respond to questions. This assessment rewards many of the same skills developed through oral composition work: clear organisation, precise vocabulary, effective engagement of the audience, and coherent argumentation. Schools should recognise the continuity between oral composition pedagogy and formal speaking assessments.

Preparation for spoken assessments provides an opportunity to consolidate oral composition skills. The process of planning, rehearsing, and delivering a presentation mirrors the writing process and reinforces the parallels between effective oral and written communication.

## Conclusion

Oral composition represents a fundamental principle of effective writing pedagogy: that articulate writing emerges from articulate talk. By providing pupils with extensive opportunities to articulate their ideas orally before writing, teachers reduce cognitive load, develop syntactic awareness, build vocabulary, and foster the metacognitive understanding that underpins skilled composition.

The approaches and strategies outlined in this knowledge file—from sentence-level rehearsal through collaborative composition to the ROAM framework—provide a comprehensive toolkit for implementing oral composition across the primary and secondary phases. The evidence from research and practice is clear: pupils who talk before they write write better.

As the Oracy All-Party Parliamentary Group (2021) concluded, oracy is not an optional extra but a fundamental entitlement. For writing pedagogy, this means recognising that oral composition is not merely preparation for writing but an integral part of the writing process itself. Teachers who embrace this principle and embed oral composition in their practice will see the benefits in the quality, sophistication, and confidence of their pupils' written work.
