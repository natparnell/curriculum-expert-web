# Discussion and Exploratory Talk in the English Classroom

## Introduction: Why Classroom Talk Matters

The quality of talk in classrooms has profound implications for pupil learning. Research consistently demonstrates that dialogic approaches—teaching that is genuinely interactive and dialogic—lead to enhanced understanding, improved reasoning skills, and greater intellectual engagement. This article explores three interconnected dimensions of classroom discourse: dialogic teaching, accountable talk, and pupil-to-pupil interaction. Together, these approaches transform classrooms from spaces of passive reception into dynamic communities of inquiry where pupils actively construct meaning through dialogue.

The National Curriculum for English recognises the centrality of spoken language, stating that it "underpins the development of reading and writing." However, merely providing opportunities for pupils to speak is insufficient. The challenge for teachers lies in cultivating specific forms of talk that accelerate learning. Discussion and exploratory talk represent perhaps the most powerful pedagogical tools available to the English teacher, enabling pupils to articulate developing understanding, test hypotheses, and refine their thinking through interaction with others.

## Part 1: Dialogic Teaching

### Foundations and Definitions

Dialogic teaching, as conceptualised by Robin Alexander and developed through the Cambridge Primary Review and subsequent work, represents a fundamental reconceptualisation of classroom interaction. Alexander defines dialogic teaching as teaching that is "collective, reciprocal, supportive, cumulative and purposeful." These five characteristics distinguish genuine dialogue from the pseudo-discussion that characterises many classrooms.

Collective means that teachers and children address learning tasks together, whether as a group or class. Reciprocal involves teachers and children listening to each other, sharing ideas, and considering alternative viewpoints. Supportive means that children articulate their ideas freely, without fear of embarrassment over "wrong" answers, and help each other to reach common understandings. Cumulative indicates that teachers and children build on their own and each other's ideas, chaining them into coherent lines of thinking and enquiry. Purposeful means that classroom talk, while encouraging the unpredictable exploration of ideas, is also planned and guided with specific educational goals in view.

Alexander contrasts dialogic teaching with the Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) pattern that dominates many classrooms. In IRF exchanges, the teacher initiates with a closed question, a pupil responds with a brief answer, and the teacher evaluates that response. While efficient for checking knowledge, IRF patterns rarely extend thinking or enable pupils to develop extended reasoning. Dialogic teaching deliberately disrupts this pattern, creating space for extended pupil contributions and genuine intellectual exchange.

### The Dialogic Classroom: Key Features

In a dialogic classroom, questions serve different purposes. Instead of predominantly testing recall, teachers employ authentic questions to which they do not already know the answer, probing questions that extend thinking, and opening-up questions that invite multiple perspectives. A dialogic teacher might ask, "What do you think the author meant here?" rather than "Can anyone tell me what simile is used?"

Wait time transforms classroom dynamics. Research by Mary Budd Rowe demonstrated that increasing wait time after asking a question from the average one second to three seconds leads to longer pupil responses, more speculative thinking, and increased participation from reluctant speakers. Dialogic teachers deliberately cultivate patience, resisting the urge to fill silences or immediately rephrase questions.

 Pupil contributions are extended and chained together. The dialogic teacher uses techniques such as revoicing (repeating or paraphrasing a pupil's contribution to highlight its significance), requesting clarification or elaboration, and explicitly linking contributions ("Who can build on what Sarah just said?"). These moves transform isolated contributions into cumulative chains of reasoning.

### Dialogic Teaching Across Key Stages

In the Early Years and Key Stage 1, dialogic teaching focuses on developing children's capacity to articulate their thinking and engage with others' ideas. Circle time activities, story discussion, and collaborative play provide contexts for exploratory talk. Teachers model the language of reasoned discussion: "I think... because..." and "I agree with... but I also think..." 

At Key Stage 2, dialogic approaches support the development of critical reading and analytical writing. Literature circles, where small groups discuss texts using defined roles, provide structured opportunities for sustained dialogue about books. Philosophy for Children (P4C) enquiries, typically conducted weekly, create spaces where pupils explore concepts and questions that emerge from their reading and experience.

In Key Stages 3 and 4, dialogic teaching becomes essential for developing the analytical and evaluative skills demanded by GCSE English. Discussion of unseen texts, exploration of writer's craft, and debate about interpretations all benefit from dialogic approaches. The dialogic classroom prepares pupils for the sophisticated reasoning required by examination questions that ask them to compare, evaluate, and respond critically.

### Professional Development and Implementation

Implementing dialogic teaching requires sustained professional development. Alexander's dialogic teaching programme involves teachers in video analysis of their own practice, guided by a framework that enables precise identification of interaction patterns. Teachers learn to recognise their default patterns and experiment with alternative moves.

Schools that successfully embed dialogic teaching often designate it as a whole-school priority, with coordinated CPD, peer observation, and shared planning time. The approach challenges deeply engrained habits, and teachers need support to persist through the initial awkwardness of changing established patterns.

## Part 2: Accountable Talk

### Origins and Principles

Accountable talk, developed through the work of Lauren Resnick and colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh's Institute for Learning, provides a complementary framework for high-quality classroom discourse. The term "accountable" signals that talk is held accountable to knowledge, to rigorous thinking, and to the community of learners.

Resnick identifies three forms of accountability that characterise productive classroom talk:

**Accountability to knowledge:** Talk is based on explicitly cited facts, information, and ideas drawn from texts, experiences, or other authoritative sources. Participants do not simply assert opinions; they ground their contributions in evidence.

**Accountability to rigorous thinking:** Talk follows established norms of reasoning. Participants make logical connections, provide reasons for their claims, and seek to identify flaws in arguments. The classroom community values reasoning over mere assertion.

**Accountability to the learning community:** Participants listen to one another and build on each other's contributions. They respect the norms of discussion, giving others space to speak and responding directly to what has been said rather than simply waiting for a turn to express their own ideas.

These three accountabilities transform classroom discussion from a series of individual contributions into a genuinely collaborative intellectual endeavour.

### Talk Moves That Support Accountability

Accountable talk does not happen spontaneously; it requires teachers to employ specific moves that scaffold productive discussion. Research by Michaels and O'Connor identifies several high-leverage talk moves:

**Revoicing:** The teacher repeats, rephrases, or summarises a pupil's contribution, often adding conceptual vocabulary. "So what I'm hearing is that you think the character is unreliable because..." This move validates the contribution while making its intellectual content more explicit.

**Asking pupils to restate:** "Who can say in their own words what Maria just claimed?" This move ensures active listening and gives pupils practice in paraphrasing and summarising.

**Asking pupils to apply their own reasoning:** "Do you agree or disagree with what Jamal said, and why?" This move requires pupils to engage with peers' ideas rather than simply waiting for their turn to speak.

**Prompting for evidence:** "What in the text makes you think that?" or "Can you give us an example?" This move holds talk accountable to knowledge.

**Challenging or offering a counter-example:** "What about this quotation—doesn't that contradict your interpretation?" This move holds talk accountable to rigorous thinking.

**Wait time:** Providing extended silence after questions and after pupil contributions, allowing thinking to develop and enabling more pupils to participate.

### Accountable Talk in English Teaching

Accountable talk proves particularly powerful in English classrooms where interpretation and evaluation are central. When discussing literature, pupils learn to ground their interpretations in textual evidence—specific quotations, structural features, or linguistic choices. The accountability to knowledge prevents discussion from becoming merely the exchange of unsupported opinions.

Accountability to rigorous thinking supports the development of analytical writing. Pupils who have practised constructing arguments orally, responding to challenges, and identifying logical connections are better prepared to produce coherent written analysis. The metacognitive awareness developed through accountable talk—thinking about one's own thinking—transfers to writing.

Accountability to the learning community creates inclusive classrooms where all voices are valued. Pupils learn that their contributions are part of a collective endeavour, not individual performances. This communal orientation supports the development of empathy and perspective-taking that enriches literary response.

### Assessing Accountable Talk

Teachers can assess the quality of accountable talk in their classrooms by considering several indicators:

- Do pupils ground their claims in specific evidence from texts or other sources?
- Do they provide reasons for their interpretations and evaluations?
- Do they respond directly to what peers have said, building on or challenging previous contributions?
- Is there evidence of genuine intellectual engagement, with pupils changing their minds or refining their thinking in response to discussion?
- Do pupils use academic vocabulary and sophisticated syntactic structures in their contributions?

Video recording of classroom discussion, analysed using frameworks such as the Accountable Talk Sourcebook, enables teachers to track progress and identify areas for development.

## Part 3: Pupil-to-Pupil Interaction

### The Case for Peer Dialogue

While teacher-pupil dialogue is important, pupil-to-pupil interaction offers distinctive benefits. When pupils talk to each other without the teacher's direct participation, they take on greater cognitive responsibility. They must formulate their own questions, monitor each other's understanding, and resolve disagreements through discussion rather than deferring to teacher authority.

Research by Neil Mercer and colleagues at the University of Cambridge has demonstrated the power of what they term "exploratory talk"—a specific mode of pupil-to-pupil interaction characterised by critical but constructive engagement with each other's ideas. In exploratory talk, pupils share relevant information, offer opinions with reasons, consider different viewpoints, and seek agreement before making decisions.

Mercer contrasts exploratory talk with two other common modes: cumulative talk, where pupils uncritically accept each other's contributions and build a shared but potentially uncritical consensus; and disputational talk, characterised by disagreement, assertion without justification, and competitive individualism. The goal of teaching is to shift pupils from these less productive modes towards exploratory talk.

### Teaching Exploratory Talk

Mercer's Thinking Together programme demonstrates that exploratory talk can be taught explicitly. The programme involves:

**Establishing ground rules:** Pupils collaboratively develop and agree upon ground rules for classroom talk. These typically include commitments such as:
- Everyone should have a chance to speak
- We listen to what others say
- We ask each other questions
- We give reasons for our views
- If we disagree, we explain why
- We try to reach agreement

**Modelling and practising:** Teachers explicitly model exploratory talk, demonstrating how to ask probing questions, provide reasons, and respond constructively to disagreement. Pupils practise these skills in structured activities before applying them independently.

**Using talk prompts:** Visual reminders and sentence starters support pupils in using exploratory language: "I think... because..."; "What evidence do you have?"; "I see it differently because..."; "Can we agree that...?"

**Group work with structured roles:** Assigning roles such as questioner, summariser, or challenger ensures that group talk maintains exploratory characteristics. Pupils rotate roles, developing versatility in their interaction patterns.

### Applications in English Teaching

Peer interaction proves particularly valuable in English classrooms across multiple domains:

**Collaborative writing:** Pairs or small groups compose texts together, discussing word choices, sentence structures, and organisational decisions. This externalises the thinking that skilled writers conduct internally, making the writing process visible and discussable.

**Peer response to writing:** Pupils provide structured feedback on each other's drafts, using criteria and prompt questions to guide their responses. This develops critical reading skills alongside metacognitive awareness of writing craft.

**Literature circles:** Small groups meet regularly to discuss shared texts, using defined roles to structure their interaction. The absence of the teacher during these discussions requires pupils to take responsibility for maintaining productive talk.

**Drama and role-play:** Hot-seating, conscience alley, and other drama strategies create contexts for sustained pupil-to-pupil interaction in role. The fictional frame often enables pupils to express ideas they might hesitate to voice in their own person.

**Preparatory pair work:** Before whole-class discussion, pupils share ideas in pairs. This ensures all pupils have articulated their thinking aloud at least once, increasing participation and the quality of contributions when the whole class convenes.

### Managing Pupil-to-Pupil Interaction

Effective pupil-to-pupil interaction requires careful classroom management. Teachers must:

**Establish clear expectations:** Pupils need to understand what productive talk sounds like and what is expected of them during group work.

**Structure tasks carefully:** Open-ended tasks that genuinely require collaboration generate more productive talk than tasks that pupils could complete individually. Jigsaw activities, where different group members hold different information, create interdependence.

**Monitor and intervene strategically:** While teachers should avoid dominating pupil discussions, strategic intervention can redirect off-task behaviour, model productive moves, or highlight particularly effective contributions for the wider class.

**Allocate sufficient time:** Meaningful dialogue cannot be rushed. Pupils need extended periods to explore ideas, encounter disagreement, and work towards resolution.

**Create physical conditions:** Classroom layout should enable pupils to face each other for discussion. Seating arrangements that force pupils to crane their necks or shout across the room inhibit productive interaction.

## Part 4: Integration and Synthesis

### Complementary Frameworks

Dialogic teaching, accountable talk, and pupil-to-pupil interaction are not competing approaches but complementary dimensions of high-quality classroom discourse. Dialogic teaching provides the overarching orientation, establishing classrooms as spaces for collective inquiry. Accountable talk offers specific moves and norms that ensure this inquiry is rigorous and grounded. Pupil-to-pupil interaction extends these principles to contexts where pupils take greater responsibility for maintaining productive dialogue.

The integration of these approaches creates classroom communities where talk genuinely transforms thinking. Pupils learn not only curriculum content but also the modes of discourse that characterise educated conversation. They develop the capacity to engage constructively with different viewpoints, to ground claims in evidence, and to refine their understanding through dialogue.

### The Role of the Teacher

Across all three approaches, the teacher's role is central though transformed. Rather than dominating classroom talk, the teacher architects the conditions for productive dialogue. They design tasks that require discussion, establish norms and expectations, model productive moves, and intervene strategically to maintain quality.

This requires sophisticated pedagogical skill. Teachers must make rapid decisions about when to extend pupil contributions, when to introduce new ideas, and when to summarise and move on. They must balance the needs of individuals with the progress of the collective, ensuring that discussion advances learning for all participants.

### Challenges and Tensions

Implementing discussion-based approaches presents genuine challenges:

**Coverage pressures:** Dialogic approaches take time. Teachers may fear that extended discussion limits content coverage. However, research suggests that depth of understanding achieved through dialogue enables more efficient learning of related content subsequently.

**Assessment constraints:** High-stakes assessment often prioritises individual written performance over oral capabilities. Teachers may struggle to justify time invested in discussion when examination success appears to depend on other skills.

**Classroom management:** Productive talk is not silent. Teachers may fear that increased pupil-to-pupil interaction leads to off-task behaviour or that it disadvantages pupils who prefer quiet reflection.

**Dominant speakers:** Some pupils naturally dominate discussion while others remain silent. Teachers must actively redistribute participation, using strategies such as wait time, think-pair-share, and targeted invitations to contribute.

**Starting points:** Pupils enter classrooms with varying experience of productive talk. Those from homes where reasoned discussion is common may have significant advantages over peers whose home discourse patterns differ.

Addressing these challenges requires whole-school commitment, sustained professional development, and policy alignment that values oracy alongside literacy.

### Evidence of Impact

Research consistently demonstrates the positive impact of dialogic and discussion-based approaches:

- Alexander's dialogic teaching trials showed significant gains in reading comprehension and mathematics reasoning.
- Mercer's Thinking Together programme demonstrated measurable improvements in reasoning test scores following intervention.
- Studies of accountable talk in US classrooms showed enhanced performance on standardised assessments alongside improved reasoning capabilities.
- Research on literature circles documents increased engagement with reading, broader reading diets, and enhanced comprehension.

These effects appear strongest when approaches are implemented with fidelity over extended periods, suggesting that superficial adoption yields limited benefits.

## Part 5: Practical Strategies for the English Classroom

### Establishing a Dialogic Culture

Begin by establishing explicit norms for classroom talk. Develop these collaboratively with pupils, ensuring they understand why particular ways of talking support learning. Display ground rules prominently and refer to them regularly.

Model the language of exploratory talk in your own contributions. Use thinking aloud to make your reasoning visible: "I'm wondering whether... because... but I also need to consider..."

Use wait time deliberately. Count silently to five after asking questions. Resist the urge to rephrase or answer your own questions.

### Structuring Discussion Activities

**Think-Pair-Share:** Allow individual thinking time before pair discussion, then invite pairs to share with the whole class. This ensures all pupils engage before the public phase.

**Concentric circles:** Inner and outer circles discuss different aspects of a text, then rotate to share insights. This generates multiple perspectives efficiently.

**Four corners:** Pupils position themselves according to their stance on a controversial statement, then justify their position and respond to counter-arguments.

**Socratic seminar:** An inner circle discusses while an outer circle observes, then swap. Observers track particular features of talk using defined protocols.

**Digital discussion:** Online forums, collaborative documents, and social media platforms can extend discussion beyond the lesson, allowing more reflective contributions from pupils who need processing time.

### Scaffolding Pupil Talk

Provide sentence starters on cards or displays:
- To build on others: "I want to add to what... said..."
- To disagree respectfully: "I see it differently because..."
- To ask for evidence: "What makes you think that?"
- To summarise: "So far, we seem to agree that..."

Use talking tokens or similar devices to ensure balanced participation in small groups.

### Assessing Progress

Develop pupils' capacity to assess their own talk. Use video recording to enable reflection on interaction patterns. Provide rubrics that make features of productive talk visible.

Consider oracy assessments that recognise discussion skills alongside individual presentation. The English Speaking Board and similar qualifications provide frameworks for assessing dialogue
