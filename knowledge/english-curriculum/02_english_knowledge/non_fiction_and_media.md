# Non-fiction and Media Literacy: Purpose, Audience, and Critical Analysis

## Introduction

Non-fiction and media literacy form a cornerstone of English education, equipping pupils with the critical skills necessary to navigate an increasingly complex information landscape. In an era of digital saturation, misinformation, and algorithm-driven content, the ability to analyse, evaluate, and create non-fiction texts has never been more essential. The National Association for the Teaching of English (NATE) argues that fostering "digital, visual, and media literacies" is fundamental to preparing students for twenty-first century citizenship (NATE, 2025).

This knowledge base addresses the statutory requirements of the National Curriculum for English, the specifications of major examination boards (AQA, Edexcel, Eduqas), and the broader imperative of developing critically literate citizens. It encompasses rhetorical analysis, understanding purpose and audience, journalistic conventions, and—critically—the digital literacy skills required to identify misinformation and engage responsibly with media.

## The National Curriculum Framework for Non-fiction

### Statutory Requirements Across Key Stages

The National Curriculum for English (2014) embeds non-fiction literacy throughout all key stages, though it does so through the lens of reading and writing rather than as a discrete subject domain.

**Key Stage 1** pupils are expected to develop skills in "discussing the sequence of events in books and how items of information are related" and to "distinguish between fiction and non-fiction" (DfE, 2013). The curriculum emphasises the beginnings of audience awareness—understanding that writing serves different purposes and that texts are constructed for particular readers.

**Key Stage 2** requirements expand significantly. Pupils must "retrieve, record and present information from non-fiction" and "participate in discussions about books that are read to them and those they can read for themselves, building on their own and others' ideas and challenging views courteously" (DfE, 2013). This establishes the foundations of critical engagement with factual texts.

**Key Stage 3** and **Key Stage 4** curricula increasingly emphasise rhetorical and critical analysis. GCSE English Language specifications across all boards require students to analyse unseen non-fiction texts, understand how writers achieve particular effects, and produce their own transactional writing for specific purposes and audiences.

### The Missing Element: Explicit Media Literacy

Despite these requirements, critical observers note that "the Department for Education was unwilling to engage with media literacy from the outset" (Buckingham, 2025). The DfE routinely responds to calls for enhanced media literacy provision by claiming it is "already well provided in the school curriculum"—a position that scholars and practitioners frequently challenge.

The DCMS Select Committee (2019) called for digital literacy to be the "fourth pillar of education alongside reading, writing and maths." The government rejected this recommendation, creating a gap between the skills students need and those the curriculum explicitly addresses. English teachers therefore bear significant responsibility for integrating media literacy into their practice, often without dedicated training or resources.

## Understanding Purpose and Audience

### The Triad of Textual Analysis

BBC Bitesize and examination specifications consistently emphasise the interrelationship of three analytical concepts:

**Purpose** refers to what a writer intends to achieve. Common purposes in non-fiction include:
- **To inform**: Presenting factual information objectively
- **To explain**: Making complex ideas accessible
- **To persuade**: Convincing the reader of a particular viewpoint
- **To entertain**: Engaging the reader through humour, narrative, or style
- **To advise**: Recommending courses of action
- **To argue**: Presenting a case with evidence and reasoning

**Audience** encompasses the intended readers of a text. Audience awareness shapes:
- **Register**: The level of formality (colloquial, standard, formal, technical)
- **Tone**: The attitude conveyed (serious, humorous, critical, sympathetic)
- **Assumed knowledge**: What the writer expects readers to already understand
- **Values and interests**: What will engage or motivate the reader

**Form** refers to the type or genre of text, including articles, speeches, letters, reviews, essays, and digital formats such as blogs and social media posts.

Understanding these three elements in combination is essential for both analysis and production. A speech arguing for environmental action delivered to young people will employ different rhetorical strategies than a report explaining climate science to policymakers—even though both address related subject matter.

### Examination Specifications

**AQA GCSE English Language** Paper 2 (Writers' Viewpoints and Perspectives) requires students to read and compare two non-fiction texts, one from the nineteenth century and one from the twenty-first century. Students must analyse how writers use language and structure to achieve effects and influence readers.

**Edexcel GCSE English Language** similarly includes non-fiction analysis and transactional writing, emphasising the relationship between purpose, audience, and linguistic choices. The specification notes that "if your purpose is to persuade, you might include rhetorical devices" alongside "literary techniques such as metaphor and simile" (BBC Bitesize, Edexcel).

**Eduqas** specifications likewise foreground non-fiction analysis, with particular attention to how writers adapt their approach for different contexts and readers.

## Rhetorical Devices and Persuasive Techniques

### Core Rhetorical Strategies

Rhetorical analysis, derived from classical traditions but adapted for contemporary classrooms, provides a toolkit for understanding how writers and speakers influence audiences. Key devices include:

**Rhetorical Questions**: Questions asked for effect rather than to elicit information. These engage readers, prompt reflection, and can create implicit agreement. For example: "What's the secret of its achievement?" invites the reader to continue reading for the answer (BBC Bitesize, 2023).

**Rule of Three (Tricolon)**: The patterning of three related items creates rhythm, completeness, and emphasis. This technique appears across genres from political speeches to advertising copy.

**Repetition and Anaphora**: The deliberate repetition of words or structures at the beginning of successive clauses creates emphasis and builds momentum. Winston Churchill's "We shall fight on the beaches... we shall fight on the landing grounds..." exemplifies this technique.

**Personal Pronouns**: Strategic use of "I," "we," "you," and "our" creates connection between writer and reader. BBC Bitesize notes how "plenty of personal pronouns... make the audience feel as though he is speaking to them on an individual level" (BBC Bitesize, 2023).

**Emotive Language**: Word choices designed to evoke particular feelings—sympathy, anger, hope, fear. Teachit resources identify "emotive language" as a key persuasive technique alongside "superlatives" and "forceful phrases" (Teachit, 2023).

**Hyperbole**: Deliberate exaggeration for effect. While potentially undermining credibility if overused, strategic hyperbole can emphasise the importance of an issue.

**Alliteration and Assonance**: Sound patterns create memorability and rhetorical impact. These techniques bridge literary and non-fiction analysis.

### Metaphor and Simile in Non-fiction

Though often associated with literary texts, metaphor and simile serve crucial functions in non-fiction writing. Metaphor creates conceptual frameworks—describing the economy as an engine, for instance, or education as a journey. Such framing shapes how readers understand and respond to information.

Save My Exams notes that "language techniques, or rhetorical devices, are the linguistic devices that make your language more persuasive and convincing" (Save My Exams, 2025). This underscores the importance of teaching these techniques not merely as analytical categories but as tools students can deploy in their own writing.

## Non-fiction Text Types

### Journalistic Writing

**Newspaper Articles** follow conventional structures that students must recognise and analyse. Hard news articles typically employ the inverted pyramid structure, with the most important information in the opening paragraph (the "lead" or "lede"). Features and opinion pieces may adopt more flexible narrative structures.

Key elements of journalistic style include:
- **Headlines**: Often employing wordplay, alliteration, or puns to capture attention
- **Lead paragraphs**: Summarising the who, what, when, where, why, and how
- **Attribution**: Sourcing claims to establish credibility
- **Direct and indirect quotation**: Integrating voices from sources
- **Transitions**: Creating coherence across sections

BBC Bitesize resources for Edexcel and Eduqas specifications include detailed guidance on analysing newspaper articles, noting how journalists use "vivid imagery and rhetorical devices" to engage readers.

**Reviews** represent another significant non-fiction genre. Whether of books, films, restaurants, or products, reviews combine information with evaluation. Effective reviews establish criteria for judgment, provide evidence from the subject under review, and reach conclusions that readers find persuasive.

### Transactional Writing

Transactional writing encompasses the practical, purposeful texts students will produce throughout their lives:

**Letters** (formal and informal) require attention to conventions of address, structure, and register. Formal letters typically include sender and recipient addresses, date, formal salutation, structured body paragraphs, appropriate close, and signature.

**Speeches** demand oral awareness—recognising that audiences cannot re-read or pause to process complex information. Rhetorical devices, direct address, and patterned structures support memorability and impact.

**Articles** for magazines, websites, or newsletters require attention to tone, engagement strategies, and the balance between information and entertainment.

**Essays** present structured arguments with evidence and reasoning. Academic essays follow particular conventions of formality, referencing, and objectivity.

### Digital and Multimodal Texts

Contemporary non-fiction increasingly encompasses digital formats that integrate written text with images, video, hyperlinks, and interactive elements. Understanding these multimodal texts requires analytical frameworks that extend beyond traditional literary approaches.

## Media Literacy: The Critical Imperative

### Defining Media Literacy

Media literacy encompasses "the ability to access, analyse, evaluate, and create media in a variety of forms" (National Literacy Trust). The Media Education Association emphasises that media literacy is "not currently statutory" in the English curriculum, creating significant variability in provision (Media Education Association, parliamentary evidence).

The DCMS Online Media Literacy Strategy (2021) identifies core competencies including:
- **Access**: Finding and navigating media content
- **Analysis**: Understanding how media are constructed and how they convey meaning
- **Evaluation**: Assessing credibility, bias, and quality
- **Creation**: Producing media responsibly and effectively

### The Challenge of Misinformation

Research by the National Literacy Trust (2018) found significant gaps in children's ability to identify fake news. The Commission on Fake News revealed that:
- Many pupils struggle to distinguish between legitimate journalism and fabricated content
- Misinformation exploits emotional responses, particularly fear and outrage
- Algorithmic curation creates "filter bubbles" that reinforce existing beliefs

The University of Birmingham (2023) demonstrated that "9-11-year-olds can be taught to spot 'fake news'" through structured news literacy education. This research shows how news literacy can be "effectively integrated into the school curriculum" through English, PSHE, Computing, and Citizenship.

Wardle and Derakhshan's influential framework classifies "information disorder" into three types:
- **Misinformation**: False information shared without intent to cause harm
- **Disinformation**: False information deliberately created and shared to cause harm
- **Malinformation**: Genuine information shared to cause harm, often by moving private information into public spheres

Understanding these distinctions enables students to respond appropriately to different types of problematic content.

### Teaching Critical Media Literacy

The English and Media Centre's survey found that core media literacy skills taught in English include:
- **Fact-checking**: Verifying claims through multiple sources
- **Creation of digital media**: Understanding how media are constructed
- **Concepts of disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation**: The information disorder framework

The LSE Media Policy Brief (2019) identified five key challenges for promoting digital literacy in schools:
1. **Lack of clear framework**: No unified approach to how digital literacy should be taught
2. **Teacher confidence and training**: 47% of teachers had not heard of government guidance on misinformation
3. **Curriculum integration**: Digital literacy must be embedded across subjects rather than treated as an add-on
4. **Rapid technological change**: The information landscape evolves faster than curriculum materials
5. **Evaluation difficulties**: Assessing critical literacy presents significant challenges

Only 14% of schools had implemented government recommendations on addressing misinformation, highlighting the gap between policy aspiration and classroom reality.

### Practical Approaches to Media Literacy Education

**Close Analysis of News Sources**: Students examine how different outlets cover the same story, identifying differences in framing, sourcing, and language. This develops awareness of perspective and bias.

**Reverse Image Search**: Teaching students to verify images by searching for their origins helps address visual misinformation.

**Lateral Reading**: Rather than evaluating a source from within its own website, students open multiple tabs to verify claims through independent sources. Research from Stanford University's History Education Group found that professional fact-checkers employ this strategy instinctively, while students and even university academics often do not.

**Creating Counter-Narratives**: Having students produce their own media—whether accurate reporting or deliberate (labelled) misinformation—develops understanding of how texts are constructed to achieve effects.

**Source Evaluation Frameworks**: Teaching structured approaches such as the CRAAP test (Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, Purpose) provides analytical scaffolding.

## Digital Literacy Across the Curriculum

### Government Policy and Provision

The GOV.UK Online Media Literacy Resources guidance (2021) signposts several educational programmes:

**NewsWise**, developed by the Guardian Foundation, the National Literacy Trust, and the PSHE Association, "aims to empower children with the skills and knowledge to engage with and enjoy news, to feel confident to ask questions and to challenge misinformation."

**The Day** publishes "daily news and curriculum-linked activities to help teachers inspire pupils to become critical thinkers and better citizens by engaging their natural curiosity in real-world problems."

However, the Media Education Association notes persistent challenges: "The fundamental problem here was that the Department for Education was unwilling to engage with media literacy from the outset" (Buckingham, 2025).

### Ofsted and Accountability

Ofsted's inspection framework does not include specific criteria for media literacy provision, though it does expect schools to prepare pupils for "life in modern Britain." The new curriculum proposals announced in November 2025 include commitments to "making citizenship compulsory in primary, ensuring all pupils learn media literacy and financial literacy"—though implementation timelines remain unclear.

## Pedagogical Approaches to Non-fiction and Media Literacy

### The Integration Imperative

Research and professional consensus support integrating media literacy throughout English teaching rather than treating it as a discrete unit. The National Literacy Trust recommends embedding critical digital literacy "into teaching, including the use of AI and strategies for tackling misinformation" across the curriculum.

Effective integration involves:
- Using authentic texts from news media, advertising, and online sources
- Connecting historical and contemporary examples of persuasive communication
- Developing students' own persuasive writing alongside their analytical skills
- Creating opportunities for students to produce media, not merely analyse it

### Progression in Media Literacy

**Primary Phase** foundations include distinguishing between fact and opinion, understanding that texts have authors with particular perspectives, and recognising advertising intent.

**Key Stage 3** develops more sophisticated analysis of rhetorical strategies, bias detection, and understanding of how media institutions operate.

**Key Stage 4** and beyond encompasses evaluation of complex information environments, understanding of algorithmic curation, and the ability to engage critically with multimedia sources.

### Addressing the Digital Divide

The National Literacy Trust's parliamentary evidence highlights that "young people from lower-income backgrounds are less likely to meet the Minimum Digital Living Standard, making targeted interventions essential. Schools should provide equal access to digital literacy resources and training to ensure all students can develop these essential skills."

This equity dimension is crucial: media literacy education that assumes home access to technology and adult guidance will widen rather than narrow achievement gaps.

## Common Misconceptions and Challenges

### Pupil Misconceptions

- **"If it's on the internet, it must be true"**: Despite widespread awareness of fake news, many pupils retain uncritical assumptions about online authority
- **"Bias is always obvious"**: Pupils may believe that biased sources announce their perspectives, missing more subtle forms of framing
- **"Facts are neutral"**: Understanding that fact selection and presentation involve judgment requires development
- **"Professional-looking sources are credible"**: Surface features of websites can mislead about underlying reliability

### Teaching Challenges

- **Rapidly evolving information environment**: Teaching resources may date quickly
- **Political sensitivity**: Media literacy can be perceived as promoting particular political perspectives
- **Assessment limitations**: Critical thinking is difficult to assess through standardised testing
- **Teacher preparation**: Many English teachers received little media literacy training in their own education

## Resources and Professional Development

### Organisations Supporting Media Literacy Education

**The National Literacy Trust** provides lesson plans, schemes of work, and professional development through its News Literacy Network.

**The English and Media Centre** offers resources specifically addressing the intersection of English teaching and media education.

**The Media Education Association** supports teacher development and advocates for media literacy within the curriculum.

**BBC Teach** provides free classroom resources around digital literacy and fake news for secondary school teaching.

**NATE** emphasises the importance of "digital, visual, and media literacies" in its recent advocacy for curriculum reform (NATE, 2025).

### Professional Development Priorities

Research indicates that teachers need support in:
- Understanding the information disorder ecosystem
- Developing classroom strategies for controversial topics
- Accessing up-to-date, reliable teaching resources
- Assessing media literacy skills formatively

## Future Directions

### Emerging Challenges

**Artificial Intelligence** presents new frontiers for media literacy education. Students must understand how AI generates content, the potential for deepfakes, and the ways algorithms shape information exposure.

**Platform Power**: Understanding how major technology companies curate and monetise attention becomes increasingly important as these platforms dominate information consumption.

**Climate Misinformation**: As environmental issues become more pressing, addressing misinformation in this domain serves both democratic and planetary imperatives.

### Policy Developments

The government's November 2025 announcement of curriculum reforms including compulsory media literacy in primary represents
## Conclusion

Non-fiction and media literacy education sits at the intersection of traditional English skills and contemporary civic imperatives. The ability to analyse rhetorical strategies, understand purpose and audience, and navigate an information environment characterised by both abundance and contamination is essential for democratic participation in the twenty-first century.

The research evidence is clear: media literacy can be taught effectively, even to primary-aged pupils, when approached systematically through the English curriculum. The University of Birmingham's finding that "9-11-year-olds can be taught to spot 'fake news'" demonstrates the potential of well-designed instruction. However, the LSE's equally clear finding that only 14% of schools have implemented guidance on misinformation reveals the implementation gap that persists between policy aspiration and classroom reality.

For English teachers, the challenge is to integrate media literacy authentically into existing curriculum structures rather than treating it as an optional add-on. This means:

**Selecting diverse and challenging texts** that represent the full range of non-fiction genres students will encounter in their lives, from traditional journalism to social media posts, from political speeches to advertising copy.

**Making analytical frameworks explicit** so that students understand not just what techniques writers use but why particular choices are effective for particular purposes and audiences.

**Connecting analysis and production** so that students' understanding of how texts work is developed through their own attempts to create effective non-fiction writing.

**Addressing the digital context** directly and honestly, acknowledging that the information landscape has transformed dramatically and that traditional literacy skills, while still essential, must be supplemented with new critical capacities.

**Attending to equity** by ensuring that all students, regardless of background, have access to the knowledge and skills they need to navigate digital environments critically.

The organisations supporting this work—the National Literacy Trust, English and Media Centre, Media Education Association, BBC Teach, and NATE—provide resources and professional development opportunities that can support teachers in developing their practice. Yet the fundamental challenge remains: media literacy is not currently statutory, and without clear accountability mechanisms, provision will remain variable.

The government's November 2025 commitment to making media literacy compulsory in primary education represents a potential turning point. Whether this translates into sustained, well-resourced provision depends on the details of implementation: the quality of training provided to teachers, the resources made available, and the accountability frameworks established to ensure that all pupils benefit.

In the meantime, English teachers continue to bear significant responsibility for preparing young people for the literacy demands of contemporary life. The frameworks, strategies, and approaches outlined in this knowledge base provide a foundation for that work. By teaching pupils to recognise rhetorical manipulation, to verify claims through independent sources, and to produce their own persuasive communications with integrity, English education serves both individual students and the broader democratic society in which they will participate.

The stakes are high. As the DCMS Online Media Literacy Strategy recognises, media literacy is not merely an academic skill but a prerequisite for informed citizenship. In an era of misinformation, disinformation, and algorithmic curation, the ability to think critically about the information we consume and produce has become essential for democratic participation. English teachers are uniquely positioned to develop these capacities in young people, and the knowledge base established here provides the foundation for that vital work.
