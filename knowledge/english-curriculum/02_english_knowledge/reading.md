# Reading: Decoding, Fluency, Comprehension and Reading for Pleasure

## Introduction

Reading lies at the heart of the English national curriculum and serves as the gateway to all other learning. The DfE's Reading Framework (2023) emphasises that reading is not merely a technical skill but a complex cognitive process involving multiple interacting components. This knowledge base explores the theoretical foundations, pedagogical approaches, and progression pathways for teaching reading across the key stages, drawing on statutory requirements, research evidence, and professional guidance from bodies including Ofsted, the DfE, the UK Literacy Association (UKLA), and the National Association for the Teaching of English (NATE).

## The Simple View of Reading: A Conceptual Framework

### Understanding the Components

The Simple View of Reading (Gough and Tunmer, 1986) provides the foundational model underpinning the English national curriculum's approach to early reading. This framework posits that reading comprehension is the product of two distinct but interdependent abilities: word recognition (decoding) and language comprehension. Neither alone is sufficient for skilled reading; pupils must develop both capacities to become proficient readers.

The DfE Reading Framework (2023) builds upon this model, recognising that pupils need secure decoding skills to free up cognitive resources for comprehension. As the framework notes, "Understanding the text is challenging if cognitive space is overloaded with decoding; this is why both accuracy and automaticity are fundamental to fluency" (DfE, 2023). This insight has profound implications for curriculum sequencing, particularly in the early years and Key Stage 1.

### Word Recognition: The Decoding Strand

Word recognition involves the speedy working out of pronunciation for unfamiliar printed words (decoding) and the speedy recognition of familiar printed words. Underpinning both is the understanding that letters on the page represent the sounds in spoken words—the alphabetic principle.

The national curriculum requires that systematic synthetic phonics (SSP) programmes be used to teach early reading. DfE-validated SSP programmes provide structured routes for most children to meet or exceed the expected standard in the Year 1 phonics screening check. These programmes typically follow a progression from simple to complex grapheme-phoneme correspondences, ensuring that pupils build a secure foundation before encountering more challenging texts.

### Language Comprehension: The Meaning Strand

Language comprehension encompasses the ability to understand spoken language and, by extension, written text once decoding barriers are removed. This includes vocabulary knowledge, syntactic awareness, background knowledge, and the ability to make inferences. The Ofsted Research Review: English (2022) notes that "Comprehension depends on understanding whole sentences and the connections between them, in addition to understanding the meaning of individual words in those sentences" (Ofsted, 2022).

## Systematic Synthetic Phonics and the Early Reading Journey

### The Rose Report Legacy

The 2006 Rose Report fundamentally reshaped reading instruction in England, establishing systematic synthetic phonics as the primary approach for teaching early reading. The subsequent revision of the national curriculum (2014) and the introduction of the statutory phonics screening check in 2012 institutionalised this approach. Schools are now required to teach SSP "first and fast" to pupils in Reception and Year 1, ensuring that all children master the basic code before moving to more complex texts.

### The Phonics Screening Check

The Year 1 phonics screening check, introduced in 2012, assesses pupils' ability to decode words using their phonic knowledge. The check consists of 40 words—20 real words and 20 pseudo-words (alien words)—that pupils read aloud to their teacher. The inclusion of pseudo-words ensures that pupils are genuinely decoding rather than relying on sight vocabulary or contextual guessing.

DfE data indicates significant improvements in phonics outcomes since the check's introduction, with the proportion of pupils meeting the expected standard rising substantially. However, the check measures decoding in isolation and does not assess comprehension. As the Ofsted English Subject Report (2024) notes, "Primary pupils are not always given sufficient teaching and practice to gain high degrees of fluency in spelling and handwriting early enough" (Ofsted, 2024), highlighting that decoding accuracy alone is insufficient.

### High-Quality SSP Teaching

Effective SSP instruction follows key principles identified in the Reading Framework:

- **Daily teaching**: Regular, structured sessions that build cumulatively
- **Systematic progression**: Moving from simple to complex correspondences
- **Rigorous assessment**: Identifying pupils who need additional support
- **Immediate intervention**: Rapid catch-up for pupils falling behind
- **Application to reading**: Using phonic knowledge in decodable books

The DfE maintains a list of validated SSP programmes that meet these criteria, providing schools with assurance of programme quality.

## Reading Fluency: The Bridge to Comprehension

### Defining Fluency

Dr Tim Rasinski describes reading fluency as "a bridge between effortful decoding and comprehension"—reading with sufficient ease so that pupils can focus on the meaning of the text (One Education, 2024). Fluency encompasses three interrelated components:

1. **Accuracy**: Correct word recognition
2. **Automaticity**: Speedy, effortless word reading
3. **Prosody**: Appropriate expression, phrasing, and intonation

The DfE Reading Framework (2023) notes that "around 90 words a minute indicate when pupils start to read with sufficient fluency to focus on their comprehension" (Standards and Testing Agency, cited in VNET, 2023). This benchmark provides teachers with a concrete indicator of when pupils have achieved sufficient automaticity to prioritise comprehension development.

### Developing Fluency in Practice

Once pupils can decode accurately and speedily, reading widely becomes the principal way they develop as readers. The Reading Framework emphasises that "putting in the 'reading miles' allows pupils to practise their reading, building experience with increasingly complex texts, encountering new knowledge, gaining new language, including vocabulary, and developing their fluency" (DfE, 2023).

Ofsted's research review identifies that exposure to text, including oral exposure, is the most important factor in explaining variation in pupils' reading fluency. This finding supports the inclusion of regular read-aloud sessions, independent reading time, and repeated reading practice in the curriculum.

### Prosody and Comprehension

Prosody—the rhythmic and expressive aspects of reading—completes the bridge to comprehension. As Marc Hayes notes, "Prosody can also be used to show that pupils can resolve ambiguity in meaning at the phrase level, e.g., the greenhouse vs the green house" (Hayes, 2023). Teachers can develop prosody through:

- Modelling expressive reading during shared reading sessions
- Teaching punctuation as cues for phrasing and intonation
- Providing opportunities for performance reading (poetry, drama)
- Using echo reading and paired reading strategies

## Reading Comprehension: Strategies and Pedagogical Approaches

### The Comprehension Process

Reading comprehension involves the construction of meaning from text through the interaction of reader, text, and context. The Ofsted Research Review (2022) identifies the key components: linguistic knowledge, orthographical knowledge, general knowledge, and cognitive processes including memory and inference-making.

Comprehension is not a single skill but a constellation of interrelated abilities that develop over time. The national curriculum reflects this complexity, requiring pupils to retrieve information, summarise, infer, predict, and evaluate across increasingly challenging texts.

### Explicit Comprehension Strategy Instruction

Research evidence supports the explicit teaching of comprehension strategies, particularly in Key Stage 2 and beyond. NATE guidance identifies key strategies including:

- **Activating prior knowledge**: Connecting text content to what pupils already know
- **Questioning**: Teaching pupils to generate and answer questions about text
- **Visualising**: Creating mental representations of text content
- **Monitoring comprehension**: Recognising when meaning breaks down and employing fix-up strategies
- **Summarising**: Distilling main ideas and key details
- **Inferencing**: Reading between the lines to understand implicit meaning

These strategies should be taught explicitly, modelled by teachers, practised collaboratively, and applied independently until they become automatic.

### Vocabulary and Comprehension

Vocabulary knowledge is a primary determinant of reading comprehension. The Ofsted English Subject Report (2024) found that training for teachers and teaching assistants to deliver the English curriculum effectively is not always at the necessary standard, particularly in relation to vocabulary development. Effective vocabulary instruction involves:

- Explicit teaching of word meanings in context
- Attention to morphology (word structure) and etymology (word origins)
- Multiple exposures to words in varied contexts
- Development of word consciousness and curiosity about language

Dr Kathy Rastle's research, highlighted in NATE conferences, demonstrates that understanding morphology is vital for vocabulary acquisition and reading comprehension, particularly for academic and disciplinary vocabulary.

### Text Selection and Curriculum Design

The national curriculum emphasises that pupils should be taught to read fluently and understand a wide range of texts, including fiction, poetry, plays, and non-fiction. Ofsted (2024) recommends that schools "plan a reading curriculum that over time builds pupils' reading fluency, linguistic knowledge and knowledge of the world, and that does not limit them to responding to exam-style questions" (Ofsted, 2024).

Effective text selection considers:

- **Complexity**: Texts that challenge pupils appropriately without overwhelming them
- **Diversity**: Texts representing varied cultures, perspectives, and experiences
- **Quality**: Texts with rich language, engaging content, and literary merit
- **Purpose**: Texts selected to build specific knowledge, skills, or reading habits

## Reading for Pleasure: The Affective Dimension

### Research Foundations

The UKLA and Open University have collaborated since 2008 on a major programme of research into Reading for Pleasure (RfP). Led by Professor Teresa Cremin, this research has established that reading for pleasure is not merely a desirable by-product of reading instruction but a critical factor in reading achievement and personal development.

The Teachers as Readers (TaRs) research project identified five key areas that create environments promoting children's volitional reading:

1. **Reading aloud**: Regular, engaging read-aloud sessions
2. **Independent reading time**: Dedicated time for self-selected reading
3. **Social reading environments**: Spaces and opportunities for talking about books
4. **Teachers as readers**: Teachers who read widely and share their reading lives
5. **Reading communities**: School-wide cultures that value and celebrate reading

### The Teacher as Reader

The TaRs research revealed that teachers' knowledge and use of children's literature significantly impacts pupils' motivation for reading. Teachers who read children's books themselves are better able to recommend appropriate texts, engage in book talk, and model enthusiastic reading behaviours.

The UKLA Reading for Pleasure Quality Mark recognises schools that demonstrate excellence in nurturing young readers who choose to read widely and frequently, within and beyond school. The award evaluates schools against criteria including:

- Whole-school reading ethos and leadership commitment
- Classroom reading environments and practices
- Library provision and access
- Parental and community engagement
- Evidence of impact on reading attitudes and behaviours

### Building Reading Communities

Cremin et al.'s work (Building Communities of Engaged Readers, 2017) demonstrates that reading for pleasure flourishes in communities where:

- Books are visible, accessible, and valued
- Adults and children talk about reading informally
- Reading choices are honoured and diverse texts available
- Reading is connected to identity, interests, and popular culture
- Barriers to access (economic, cultural, linguistic) are addressed

### The National Year of Reading

In 2025, the government announced a National Year of Reading, uniting parents, schools, libraries, and businesses to reverse the decline in reading for pleasure among young people. This initiative recognises that while phonics instruction has improved decoding skills, ensuring that pupils develop the will as well as the skill to read remains a significant challenge.

## Progression Across the Key Stages

### Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS)

In the EYFS, reading development is embedded within the Communication and Language and Literacy areas of learning. The statutory framework requires that children:

- Develop phonological awareness and early phonic knowledge
- Understand that print carries meaning
- Develop comprehension through listening to stories and non-fiction
- Handle books with increasing care and attention

The Reading Framework emphasises the importance of early language development as the foundation for later reading success, noting that "language comprehension is essential for both reading and writing" (DfE, 2023).

### Key Stage 1 (Years 1-2)

KS1 priorities include:

- Secure decoding through systematic synthetic phonics
- Development of sight vocabulary for common exception words
- Building fluency through extensive reading practice
- Developing basic comprehension through questioning and discussion
- Fostering positive attitudes toward reading

The phonics screening check at the end of Year 1 provides a checkpoint for decoding development, with retakes in Year 2 for pupils who do not meet the expected standard.

### Key Stage 2 (Years 3-6)

As pupils progress through KS2, the emphasis shifts from learning to read to reading to learn. Priorities include:

- Consolidating fluency and automaticity
- Developing sophisticated comprehension strategies
- Building vocabulary and knowledge of the world
- Reading increasingly complex and diverse texts
- Maintaining and developing reading for pleasure

The Ofsted Research Review notes that by upper KS2, pupils should be able to read with sufficient fluency to access the curriculum across subjects, making reading a tool for learning rather than the primary focus of instruction.

### Key Stage 3 (Years 7-9)

The transition to secondary school presents particular challenges for reading development. The Reading Framework's expansion to include secondary guidance (2023) reflects concern that some pupils arrive at secondary school without the reading skills needed to access the curriculum.

KS3 priorities include:

- Identifying and supporting struggling readers through diagnostic assessment
- Maintaining reading for pleasure provision
- Developing disciplinary literacy (reading in subject-specific ways)
- Building reading stamina and engagement with longer, more complex texts
- Using reading to build cultural capital and background knowledge

The framework notes that "once pupils have practised decoding the same word several times, they can read it," emphasising the importance of repeated exposure to academic and disciplinary vocabulary.

### Key Stage 4 and 5 (Years 10-13)

At GCSE and A-level, reading becomes increasingly specialised and demanding. The curriculum requires pupils to:

- Analyse and evaluate sophisticated literary and non-literary texts
- Compare texts and perspectives critically
- Read extended texts (novels, plays) independently
- Develop subject-specific reading practices in English Literature, Language, and combined courses

For pupils continuing to A-level, reading encompasses critical theory, wider reading in literary contexts, and independent research using academic sources.

## Assessment and Intervention

### Diagnostic Assessment

Effective reading assessment moves beyond standardised scores to identify specific strengths and needs. Diagnostic assessment might evaluate:

- Phonemic awareness and phonic knowledge
- Sight vocabulary and decoding strategies
- Reading fluency (accuracy, rate, prosody)
- Comprehension at literal, inferential, and evaluative levels
- Vocabulary knowledge and word-learning strategies
- Attitudes toward reading and self-concept as a reader

### Early Identification and Intervention

The Reading Framework emphasises that "a pupil who is likely to fail to learn to read is identifiable very early" (DfE, 2023). Early intervention programmes, delivered by trained teaching assistants or teachers, can prevent long-term reading difficulties. Effective interventions are:

- Timely: Delivered as soon as needs are identified
- Intensive: Providing more instruction than classroom teaching alone
- Explicit: Direct teaching of identified skills
- Systematic: Following a structured, cumulative programme
- Monitored: Regularly assessed to ensure progress

### Supporting Older Struggling Readers

For pupils who arrive at secondary school with reading difficulties, the Reading Framework provides guidance on supporting older pupils who need additional phonics instruction. This includes ensuring that:

- Materials are age-appropriate in content while addressing foundational skills
- Teaching is delivered by trained staff
- Interventions are discrete and do not stigmatise pupils
- Progress is monitored and celebrated

## Common Misconceptions and Challenges

### Misconceptions About Reading Development

**Misconception 1**: "Comprehension can only happen after decoding, not alongside."
While accuracy is essential, the reading process involves continuous interaction between decoding and comprehension. As pupils develop, these processes become increasingly integrated.

**Misconception 2**: "Phonics is only for early readers."
Phonic knowledge continues to develop throughout schooling as pupils encounter increasingly complex vocabulary. Morphological awareness builds upon phonological foundations.

**Misconception 3**: "Reading for pleasure is a luxury we cannot afford."
Research demonstrates that reading for pleasure is strongly associated with reading attainment and wider educational outcomes. It is an essential, not optional, component of reading education.

### Current Challenges

The Ofsted English Subject Report (2024) identified several ongoing challenges:

- **Fluency and comprehension**: While phonics has improved, building fluency and comprehension remains less well understood by teachers.
- **Secondary provision**: Some secondaries do not do enough to identify and support struggling readers.
- **Vocabulary development**: Teaching subject-specific and academic vocabulary requires further development.
- **Reading for pleasure**: Reversing declining trends in reading for pleasure remains a significant challenge.

## Conclusion

Reading education in England operates within a well-defined statutory framework that emphasises systematic synthetic phonics, fluency development, and comprehension. The DfE Reading Framework and Ofsted research reviews provide detailed guidance for implementation, while professional bodies including UKLA and NATE offer research-informed approaches to reading for pleasure and comprehension instruction.

Effective reading curricula address all components of reading—decoding, fluency, comprehension, and motivation—in a coordinated progression that recognises the developmental nature of reading expertise. By understanding the theoretical foundations and evidence base, teachers can make informed decisions about curriculum design, pedagogy, and intervention that ensure all pupils become confident, capable, and enthusiastic readers.

## Pedagogical Application: Classroom Strategies

### Developing Decoding Skills

Effective decoding instruction requires systematic, explicit teaching of the alphabetic code. Teachers should:

**Reception and Year 1:**
- Follow a validated SSP programme with fidelity
- Teach phoneme-grapheme correspondences in a structured sequence
- Provide daily practice in blending for reading and segmenting for spelling
- Use decodable books that match pupils' current phonic knowledge
- Identify pupils falling behind immediately and provide daily intervention

**Year 2 and beyond:**
- Continue to teach the complete alphabetic code including complex graphemes
- Address gaps in phonic knowledge for pupils who struggled in KS1
- Teach morphology—how prefixes, suffixes, and root words affect meaning
- Develop automatic recognition of high-frequency words

### Building Fluency Through Repeated Reading

Repeated reading of appropriately challenging texts has been shown to improve fluency significantly. Effective approaches include:

**Echo Reading:** The teacher reads a sentence or paragraph with expression, then pupils echo the same passage. This models prosody while giving pupils scaffolded practice.

**Paired Reading:** More fluent readers pair with less fluent readers, reading aloud together with the stronger reader providing immediate correction and modelling.

**Performance Reading:** Preparing texts for performance—whether poetry recitations, Readers Theatre, or class assemblies—provides authentic purpose for developing expressive reading.

**Choral Reading:** Whole-class or group reading of texts develops confidence and allows less fluent readers to participate without individual exposure.

### Teaching Comprehension Explicitly

The Gradual Release of Responsibility model works effectively for comprehension instruction:

**I Do (Modelling):** The teacher thinks aloud while reading, making their comprehension processes visible. "I notice the author has used the word 'however' here—that tells me something unexpected is coming. Let me read on to see what contrasts with what I just learned."

**We Do (Guided Practice):** Teacher and pupils practise the strategy together, with the teacher providing prompts and support. "Let's look at this paragraph together. What questions might we ask to check our understanding?"

**You Do Together (Collaborative Practice):** Pupils work in pairs or small groups to apply the strategy, with the teacher circulating to observe and support.

**You Do Alone (Independent Practice):** Pupils apply the strategy independently, with the teacher monitoring through conferencing or assessment.

### Vocabulary Instruction in Context

Beck, McKeown, and Kucan's three-tier framework helps teachers prioritise vocabulary instruction:

**Tier 1 Words:** Basic, everyday vocabulary that most pupils acquire through conversation (e.g., walk, happy, house). These require little explicit instruction.

**Tier 2 Words:** High-utility academic vocabulary that appears across multiple contexts (e.g., analyse, consequence, significant). These words should be taught explicitly and revisited frequently.

**Tier 3 Words:** Domain-specific vocabulary tied to particular subjects or topics (e.g., photosynthesis, democracy, metaphor). These should be taught as needed within subject contexts.

Effective vocabulary instruction involves:
- Providing child-friendly definitions
- Connecting new words to known concepts
- Using visuals and examples
- Creating opportunities for pupils to use new words in speaking and writing
- Revisiting words multiple times over days and weeks

### Creating a Reading for Pleasure Culture

Schools that successfully nurture reading for pleasure typically demonstrate:

**Leadership Commitment:** Senior leaders articulate the value of reading for pleasure, allocate resources (time, money, staffing), and model reading behaviours themselves.

**Time and Space:** Dedicated time for independent reading; attractive, well-stocked reading areas; regular read-aloud sessions that are protected from other demands.

**Reading Relationships:** Teachers who know their pupils as readers—what they enjoy, what they've read, what they might try next. Book recommendations that are personalised and enthusiastic.

**Diverse Collections:** Books that reflect the diversity of the school community and the wider world; texts in community languages; graphic novels, non-fiction, poetry, and magazines alongside traditional fiction.

**Parental Engagement:** Workshops for parents on supporting reading at home; lending libraries; communication about the importance of reading for pleasure alongside reading accuracy.

### Addressing Barriers to Reading

Some pupils face specific barriers that require targeted support:

**English as an Additional Language (EAL):** Pupils learning English benefit from maintaining and developing literacy in their home language while acquiring English reading skills. The Reading Framework notes that bilingualism is an asset, not a deficit.

**Special Educational Needs:** Pupils with dyslexia may require structured, multi-sensory phonics instruction beyond the mainstream programme. Those with language difficulties may need additional support with vocabulary and comprehension.

**Socioeconomic Disadvantage:** Pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds often have less exposure to books and reading at home. Schools can compensate through rich reading environments, access to high-quality texts, and targeted support.

**Reluctant Readers:** Some pupils can decode but choose not to read. Understanding their interests, providing high-interest/low-difficulty texts, and connecting reading to their passions can help shift attitudes.

## Assessment Approaches

### Formative Assessment

Ongoing, classroom-based assessment informs teaching decisions:

- **Running Records:** Capturing miscues and self-corrections during oral reading to analyse reading behaviours
- **Comprehension Conversations:** One-to-one discussions about texts that reveal depth of understanding
- **Reading Journals:** Pupils' written responses that demonstrate engagement and interpretation
- **Observation:** Noting how pupils select, engage with, and discuss books

### Summative Assessment

Standardised assessments provide benchmarking data:

- **Phonics Screening Check:** Year 1 statutory assessment of decoding
- **SATs Reading Tests:** End of KS1 and KS2 assessments of comprehension
- **NGRT/GL Assessment:** Standardised reading tests providing reading ages and diagnostic information
- **GCSE English Language:** Reading assessments at age 16

Diagnostic assessment sits between these approaches, using tools such as:
- Phonics tracking assessments
- Fluency probes (words correct per minute)
- Vocabulary assessments
- Comprehension strategy checklists

## Technology and Reading

Digital texts and tools offer opportunities and challenges:

**Opportunities:**
- E-books with built-in dictionaries and audio support
- Apps that provide personalised reading practice
- Audiobooks that develop comprehension and vocabulary
- Online communities for sharing book recommendations

**Challenges:**
- Distraction from reading by other device features
- Difficulty of deep reading on screens for some pupils
- Digital divide affecting access
- Need for explicit instruction in digital reading strategies

The Reading Framework recommends that digital texts should supplement, not replace, physical books, particularly for developing readers.

## Conclusion: The Teacher as Reading Advocate

Ultimately, the quality of reading education depends on teachers who understand reading development, are passionate about books, and are skilled in teaching strategies. The Ofsted English Subject Report (2024) found that where English is taught well, teachers:

- Have strong subject knowledge about reading development
- Use assessment effectively to identify needs
- Select texts that challenge and engage
- Teach comprehension strategies explicitly
- Foster positive attitudes toward reading
- Work collaboratively across the school to ensure consistent approaches

Reading opens doors—to knowledge, to empathy, to imagination, to opportunity. Ensuring that every child becomes a reader is one of the most important responsibilities educators hold. Through evidence-informed practice, careful curriculum design, and a commitment to nurturing both the skill and the will to read, schools can fulfil this responsibility.
