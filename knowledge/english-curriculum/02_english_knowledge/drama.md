# Drama and Performance Texts

## Overview

Drama occupies a distinctive and multifaceted position within the English curriculum, functioning simultaneously as a literary form, a method of exploring texts, and a creative practice in its own right. The National Curriculum for England (2013) positions drama as a statutory component of spoken language across all key stages, requiring pupils to adopt, create, and sustain roles, improvise, devise, script, rehearse, and respond thoughtfully to dramatic performances. This knowledge domain encompasses the theatrical and literary dimensions of drama, practical conventions and techniques for classroom use, approaches to scripted and improvised work, and strategies for studying plays as literature at Key Stage 3 and GCSE.

Understanding drama as both process and product enables teachers to unlock the subject's unique potential for developing pupils' confidence, empathy, analytical skills, and creativity. Whether exploring Shakespeare through performance-based pedagogy or devising original work from stimulus materials, drama offers distinctive ways of knowing that complement and enhance traditional literary study.

## Drama in the National Curriculum

### Statutory Requirements

Drama is not a discrete national curriculum subject but is embedded within the English programmes of study, specifically within the Spoken Language section. The Department for Education (2014) states that pupils should have opportunities to improvise, devise and script drama for one another and a range of audiences, as well as to rehearse, refine, share and respond thoughtfully to drama and theatre performances.

These requirements apply across all key stages, though the complexity and sophistication of work naturally increases as pupils mature. The statutory nature of drama within English means that all pupils are entitled to regular, structured drama experiences, regardless of whether their school offers drama as a separate subject or examination option.

### Progression Framework

**Key Stage 1 (Years 1-2)**

At this foundational stage, drama activities focus on role play and imaginative exploration. Pupils use dramatic play to inhabit fictional worlds, explore characters and situations, and develop confidence in speaking and listening. Activities might include acting out stories, hot-seating characters from picture books, or using role play to explore social situations.

**Key Stage 2 (Years 3-6)**

Pupils develop more structured dramatic skills, learning to sustain roles over extended periods and work collaboratively in groups. They begin to understand the distinction between performer and audience, and they start to use simple dramatic conventions such as freeze frames and thought tracking. Scripted work might include reading plays aloud and performing short extracts.

**Key Stage 3 (Years 7-9)**

The Key Stage 3 curriculum demands more sophisticated engagement with dramatic form. Pupils should work with increasingly complex scripts, understand how dramatic techniques create meaning, and explore theatrical history and conventions. The Oak National Academy (n.d.) provides fully sequenced drama teaching resources for Key Stage 3, supporting progression from basic skills to more advanced theatrical understanding.

**Key Stage 4 (Years 10-11)**

For GCSE English Literature, pupils study at least one complete play, analysing how dramatists create meaning through structure, language, and stagecraft. For those taking GCSE Drama as a separate subject, work becomes more specialised, involving both performance and written analysis of live theatre.

## Drama Conventions and Techniques

### Process Drama

Process drama represents a pedagogical approach in which participants and teacher work together to explore fictional situations, characters, and themes through improvised dramatic action. Bolton (as cited in ScienceDirect, 2024) encapsulated how process drama organically integrates improvisation, thematic exploration, independent scene units, script generation through action, focus on participant changes, and experience without written text.

In process drama, the emphasis lies on the learning that occurs during the dramatic exploration rather than on creating a polished performance for an external audience. This approach proves particularly valuable when exploring complex texts or themes, as it allows pupils to inhabit fictional situations and understand them from multiple perspectives.

### Teacher in Role

Teacher in role stands as one of the most powerful yet challenging drama techniques. The teacher adopts a fictional character within the drama, using this position to shape the dramatic process and develop pupils' learning. This technique can accelerate narrative development, introduce new information or perspectives, create dramatic tension, and model sophisticated language use.

Effective teacher in role requires careful preparation and clear boundaries. The teacher signals entry into and exit from role clearly, often using costume elements or physical positioning. While in role, the teacher maintains awareness of learning objectives and uses questions and challenges to deepen pupils' engagement with the dramatic situation.

### Still Image and Freeze Frame

The still image or freeze frame technique involves participants creating frozen tableaux that represent moments, relationships, or ideas. After holding a freeze frame for a few moments, it becomes surprisingly easy for pupils to identify with a role and express their thoughts, enabling the teacher to gather feedback from all participants (Drama Resource, 2025).

This convention proves particularly useful for:
- Capturing key moments from narrative texts
- Exploring character relationships and power dynamics
- Representing abstract concepts or themes
- Creating visual summaries of learning

When using still images, teachers should encourage pupils to consider not only their own position and expression but also how they relate spatially to other characters in the frame.

### Thought Tracking

Thought tracking builds upon still image work by giving voice to characters' inner thoughts. Characters in a freeze-frame speak thoughts and feelings aloud, often revealing the gap between external appearance and internal reality. This technique proves invaluable for developing character analysis and exploring motivation.

In the English classroom, thought tracking helps pupils understand that characters in literature possess interior lives not always apparent from dialogue and action alone. When applied to Shakespeare or other complex texts, thought tracking makes visible the subtext that experienced readers infer but that pupils often struggle to recognise.

### Hot Seating

Hot seating involves one pupil (or the teacher) adopting a character role and answering questions from the rest of the group. Arts on the Move (n.d.) describes this as a technique for students to answer questions from the group whilst in role. Characters can be placed on the Hotseat away from the drama, or respond from within it.

This convention develops:
- Character understanding through interrogation
- Questioning skills among the audience
- Improvisational thinking in the hot-seated participant
- Evidence-based speculation about motivation and backstory

For maximum effectiveness, hot seating should follow sufficient exploration of the text to ensure participants have evidence to draw upon in their questioning.

### Mantle of the Expert

Developed by Dorothy Heathcote, mantle of the expert positions pupils as expert practitioners within a fictional context. Rather than playing characters in a narrative, they adopt professional roles—archaeologists, scientists, historians—tasked with solving problems or investigating situations. This approach proves particularly powerful for cross-curricular work and for approaching texts that benefit from historical or contextual investigation.

## Role Play and Improvisation

### Educational Purposes of Role Play

Role play serves multiple educational functions within the English curriculum. At its simplest, it develops confidence in speaking and listening. More profoundly, it cultivates empathy by requiring pupils to inhabit perspectives different from their own. As Trivium 21c (2021) notes, drama methods enable children to express their feelings and opinions within a restricted frame of reference, providing safe space for exploring challenging ideas.

In the context of literary study, role play deepens textual understanding by making abstract printed words concrete and embodied. Pupils who struggle to analyse character motivation through silent reading often demonstrate sophisticated understanding when asked to improvise a scene or respond in role to questions.

### Structured Improvisation

While spontaneous improvisation has value, structured improvisation typically proves more productive in educational settings. Teachers provide clear parameters: roles, relationships, objectives, and obstacles. This structure prevents the paralysis that open-ended improvisation can induce while still requiring creative problem-solving and spontaneous thinking.

A structured improvisation might involve:
- Two characters with conflicting objectives meeting for the first time
- A family discussion the night before a significant event
- A professional interview or interrogation
- A negotiation between opposing sides

The teacher can increase complexity by introducing new information, changing circumstances, or adding additional characters.

### Scripted Versus Improvised Work

Both scripted and improvised work deserve place in the English curriculum, serving different but complementary purposes:

**Improvised work** develops:
- Spontaneous creativity and problem-solving
- Listening and responding skills
- Comfort with uncertainty and risk-taking
- Understanding of dramatic structure through creation

**Scripted work** develops:
- Close reading and textual analysis
- Voice and physical control
- Understanding of theatrical conventions
- Appreciation of dramatic craftsmanship

The most effective drama teaching moves fluidly between these modes, using improvisation to explore possibilities before working with scripts, or using scripts as springboards for improvisational exploration.

## Studying Plays as Literature

### The Unique Nature of Drama as Text

Plays present distinctive challenges and opportunities as literary texts. Unlike novels or poems, plays are fundamentally incomplete on the page—they require realisation through performance to achieve their full effect. Michael LoMonico (as cited in Lafayette Symposium, 2019) refers to performance in the classroom as a form of close reading: it is close reading on your feet. The act of performance entails a precise and unremitting engagement with the playwright's script.

This dual nature—literary artefact and performance script—means that effective drama teaching must attend to both textual analysis and theatrical realisation. Pupils need to understand how stage directions, dramatic irony, and subtext create meaning, but they also need opportunities to experience these elements in action.

### Teaching Shakespeare Through Performance

Shakespeare's plays present particular challenges due to their linguistic density and cultural distance from contemporary pupils. Performance-based pedagogies prove especially valuable here, as they make the text physically and vocally present rather than merely printed words to be silently decoded.

Cambridge University Press (n.d.) highlights approaches to teaching Shakespeare through drama, examining different iterations of active Shakespeare pedagogies in the UK, the USA, and Australia. These approaches draw a distinction between reading through drama as an approach and the theatre-inflected practices promoted by well-known arts-based institutions.

Key strategies for teaching Shakespeare through performance include:

**Line Walking**: Pupils walk the space while speaking lines, exploring how physical movement affects interpretation and understanding.

**Choral Speaking**: Groups speak lines in unison or in parts, experiencing the rhythm and sound patterns of verse.

**Tableaux Vivants**: Creating still images of key scenes or moments, then bringing them to life with movement and speech.

**Editing for Performance**: Pupils select and sequence extracts to create their own performance versions, requiring deep engagement with the text's structure and meaning.

**Mini-Performances**: Small groups prepare short scenes for presentation, focusing on specific interpretive choices.

### Modern Drama at GCSE

The GCSE English Literature specifications require study of at least one post-1914 play. Common choices include J.B. Priestley's An Inspector Calls, Arthur Miller's The Crucible, or Willy Russell's Blood Brothers. These texts offer different challenges and opportunities from Shakespeare.

Modern drama often addresses social issues directly, making it accessible for contemporary pupils but potentially leading to reductive readings that see the play merely as a vehicle for message rather than a crafted artistic work. Effective teaching maintains attention to dramatic technique—how Priestley uses dramatic irony, how Miller structures scenes for maximum tension, how Russell uses music and lighting—while also engaging with thematic content.

Teachit (2021) provides classroom resources for teaching modern drama texts and Shakespeare, supporting the development of learners' understanding of language, structure, and dramatic techniques.

### Analysing Dramatic Techniques

Pupils studying drama as literature need vocabulary and frameworks for analysing dramatic techniques:

**Stagecraft Elements**:
- Stage directions and their implications
- Setting and its symbolic significance
- Props and their dramatic function
- Lighting and sound effects
- Costume and physical appearance

**Structural Features**:
- Scene and act division
- Dramatic irony
- Exposition, rising action, climax, resolution
- Parallel scenes and dramatic echoes
- The unities (time, place, action)

**Language Features**:
- Dialogue and subtext
- Soliloquy and aside
- Dramatic prose and verse
- Register and dialect
- Repetition and patterning

Teaching these elements most effectively combines analytical discussion with practical exploration—pupils understand stage directions better after attempting to follow them in performance, and they grasp the effect of asides after trying to deliver them to an audience.

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Integrating Drama into English Teaching

While some schools teach drama as a discrete subject, the National Curriculum positioning within English means that all English teachers need strategies for incorporating dramatic approaches. Drama Resource (2017) notes that drama is a statutory part of English, and effective integration requires more than occasional role-play activities.

Meaningful integration involves:
- Using drama to explore texts before analytical writing
- Developing spoken language confidence through dramatic work
- Teaching specific dramatic conventions as tools for interpretation
- Creating opportunities for pupils to respond to live and recorded theatre
- Assessing dramatic work as part of English achievement

### Supporting Reluctant Participants

Not all pupils welcome drama activities. Some feel self-conscious about performance; others may have cultural or personal objections to embodying fictional characters. Effective teachers provide multiple entry points and allow pupils to contribute in different ways:

- **Non-performing roles**: Directors, designers, writers, and observers contribute meaningfully without being onstage.
- **Gradual exposure**: Starting with pair work and small groups before whole-class activities.
- **Clear boundaries**: Establishing when and how pupils can opt out, and what alternative tasks involve.
- **Emphasis on process**: Valuing exploration and learning over polished performance.

### Differentiation in Drama

Drama offers natural differentiation opportunities. More confident pupils can take larger roles, direct others, or attempt more challenging improvisation tasks. Those less comfortable with performance can contribute through writing, design, or observation. The collaborative nature of drama also means that peer support often emerges organically, with pupils helping each other learn lines, develop characterisations, or understand stage directions.

### Assessment of Drama in English

Assessment of drama work should balance process and product, recognising that learning occurs throughout the creative journey, not only in final performance. Assessment might consider:

- **Participation and collaboration**: Working effectively with others, contributing ideas, supporting peers
- **Understanding of text**: Demonstrating comprehension of the source material through dramatic response
- **Use of conventions**: Appropriately selecting and employing dramatic techniques
- **Reflection and evaluation**: Articulating choices made and learning gained
- **Performance skills**: Where appropriate, vocal clarity, physical control, and audience awareness

Fortismere School's Drama Department (n.d.) describes how all students evaluate their and others' work through the use of What Went Well and Even Better If at KS3, with more sophisticated evaluation at KS4 and 5.

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Time Constraints

**Solution**: Integrate drama into existing lessons rather than treating it as an add-on. Ten minutes of hot-seating characters before analytical writing deepens understanding and improves essay quality. Use drama as a reading strategy, not merely a performance activity.

### Challenge: Classroom Space

**Solution**: Drama can occur in any space, including crowded classrooms with fixed furniture. Still images, hot seating, and small-group improvisation require minimal space. When possible, use corridors, halls, or outdoor spaces for larger movement work.

### Challenge: Pupil Self-Consciousness

**Solution**: Build drama work progressively, starting with low-stakes activities in pairs before moving to group work. Use masks, puppets, or written role cards to create distance between pupil and character. Emphasise that the goal is learning, not theatrical excellence.

### Challenge: Assessment Pressure

**Solution**: Connect drama explicitly to assessed skills. Performance activities develop the analytical understanding that leads to better examination essays. Spoken language activities prepare pupils for presentation assessments. Document drama work through photographs, recordings, or written reflections that demonstrate learning.

## Conclusion

Drama within the English curriculum represents far more than enrichment or occasional variation from standard lessons. As a statutory component of spoken language and an essential approach to studying plays as literature, drama provides distinctive ways of knowing that complement and enhance traditional literary study. Through process drama, teacher in role, and specific conventions such as hot seating and thought tracking, pupils develop empathy, confidence, analytical skills, and creativity.

The dual nature of plays—as literary texts and performance scripts—requires teachers to balance close reading with practical exploration. Whether approaching Shakespeare through performance-based pedagogy or analysing modern drama through examination of dramatic techniques, effective drama teaching makes texts live in the classroom, creating embodied understanding that persists long after the lesson ends.

By developing robust subject knowledge of drama conventions, progression frameworks, and pedagogical approaches, English teachers can fulfil their statutory responsibilities while also enriching their pupils' educational experience and developing transferable skills of communication, collaboration, and creative thinking.

### Using Drama with Different Text Types

While drama is most obviously connected to plays, dramatic techniques can illuminate other literary forms:

**Novels and Short Stories**

Key scenes from prose fiction lend themselves to dramatisation. Pupils might script and perform pivotal moments, use hot seating to explore character motivation, or create still images representing thematic elements. This approach proves particularly valuable for reluctant readers, providing access points to texts they might struggle with through silent reading alone.

**Poetry**

Dramatic monologues naturally invite performance, but even lyric poetry benefits from dramatic treatment. choral speaking emphasises rhythm and sound patterns; tableaux vivants capture visual imagery; and role play exploring the speaker's situation deepens understanding of voice and perspective.

**Non-Fiction and Media Texts**

Drama can bring non-fiction to life through re-enactment, reconstruction, and role play exploring different perspectives on factual events. Documentary drama, verbatim theatre, and tribunal plays provide models for how factual material can be treated dramatically.

### The Role of Live Theatre

While classroom drama focuses on process and learning, exposure to professional theatre provides models of excellence and inspires aspirational standards. Where possible, schools should:

- Organise theatre visits to see productions of set texts
- Host visiting theatre companies for workshops and performances
- Use high-quality recorded theatre productions when live visits prove impossible
- Connect theatre experiences explicitly to classroom learning

The National Curriculum's requirement that pupils respond thoughtfully to drama and theatre performances implies regular exposure to professional work beyond their own classroom efforts.

### Drama and Oracy

The Oracy Council and related initiatives have renewed attention on spoken language development, positioning drama as central to oracy education. Drama activities develop the physical, linguistic, and social dimensions of oracy identified by researchers:

**Physical**: Voice projection, articulation, clarity, gesture, posture
**Linguistic**: Vocabulary acquisition, formal and informal registers, narrative structure, rhetorical devices
**Cognitive**: Formulating questions, building on others' ideas, reasoning, explaining, speculating
**Social**: Collaboration, turn-taking, empathy, audience awareness

English teachers using drama explicitly connect these skills to broader communication competence, preparing pupils for the spoken language assessments at GCSE and for life beyond school.

### Planning Drama Sequences

Effective drama rarely occurs as isolated activities but rather as planned sequences building understanding over time. A typical sequence might involve:

1. **Pre-text exploration**: Using drama to establish context, introduce themes, or activate prior knowledge before encountering the written text
2. **Textual encounter**: Reading or watching the play, identifying key moments and challenges
3. **Deepening exploration**: Using drama conventions to explore character, motivation, and subtext
4. **Analytical consolidation**: Moving from dramatic exploration to analytical writing, using the embodied understanding developed through drama
5. **Creative response**: Devising original work inspired by the studied text

This sequence ensures that drama serves learning rather than merely entertaining, with each phase building towards the next in a coherent progression.

### Professional Development for Teachers

Many English teachers lack formal drama training, yet the statutory requirements mean all must incorporate dramatic approaches. Support strategies include:

- **Collaboration with drama specialists**: Where schools have drama departments, English teachers can observe, team-teach, and learn from specialist colleagues
- **Professional reading**: Books by Dorothy Heathcote, Gavin Bolton, Jonothan Neelands, and David Farmer provide theoretical foundations and practical techniques
- **External training**: Organisations such as the National Drama association and Shakespeare's Globe offer CPD for English teachers
- **Peer observation**: Watching colleagues teach using drama provides concrete models and builds confidence

The investment in developing drama expertise pays dividends across the English curriculum, enhancing teaching of texts, improving pupil engagement, and developing spoken language skills.

### Future Directions

Drama in English continues to evolve, with several trends shaping contemporary practice:

**Technology Integration**: Digital recording, virtual reality, and online collaboration tools offer new possibilities for drama work, including remote performance and digital devising.

**Diverse Voices**: Curriculum diversification has increased attention to plays by writers from underrepresented groups, requiring teachers to develop knowledge beyond the traditional canon.

**Research-Informed Practice**: Growing evidence base for drama's impact on reading comprehension, empathy, and communication supports its place in the curriculum and informs effective pedagogy.

**Cross-Curricular Drama**: Recognition that drama supports learning across subjects has led to whole-school approaches embedding dramatic methods in history, science, and other areas.

As the educational landscape changes, drama's distinctive contribution to English teaching—developing confident speakers, empathetic readers, and creative thinkers—remains as valuable as ever.
