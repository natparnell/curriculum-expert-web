# Shakespeare Across Key Stages: Teaching Approaches and Curriculum Progression

## Overview

William Shakespeare occupies a unique position in the English National Curriculum as the only author explicitly named in statutory requirements. From first encounters in Key Stage 2 through to sophisticated critical analysis at A-level, Shakespearean study forms a continuous thread in English education. This knowledge base examines pedagogical approaches, curriculum requirements, and progression frameworks across all key stages, drawing on research from the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), exam board specifications, and contemporary pedagogical scholarship.

The teaching of Shakespeare presents distinctive challenges: the linguistic distance of Early Modern English, cultural assumptions about Shakespeare's "difficulty," and the tension between active, creative approaches and examination-focused textual analysis. Effective pedagogy navigates these challenges while fostering pupils' appreciation of Shakespeare's dramatic artistry and enduring relevance.

## Statutory Requirements and Curriculum Position

### National Curriculum Mandates

The English programmes of study for Key Stages 2, 3, and 4 establish Shakespeare as compulsory content:

**Key Stage 2 (Years 3-6)**

Pupils should be taught to "read, listen to and discuss...stories, plays and poems, including Shakespeare" (Department for Education, 2013). While not quantified by specific time requirements, the statutory guidance expects children to encounter Shakespearean works adapted appropriately for their age, typically through drama-based approaches and narrative versions rather than full study of original texts.

**Key Stage 3 (Years 7-9)**

The requirement becomes more explicit: pupils must study "two plays by Shakespeare" during this key stage. This represents a significant increase in exposure and expectation compared to primary schooling.

**Key Stage 4 (GCSE)**

All English Literature specifications require study of at least one Shakespeare play. AQA, the largest awarding body, assesses Shakespeare through Paper 1: "Shakespeare and the 19th-Century Novel," with the Shakespeare question carrying 34 marks (40% of the paper).

**Key Stage 5 (A-Level)**

While not compulsory at A-level, Shakespeare remains overwhelmingly popular. Most centres study at least one Shakespeare play, often selected from the tragedy genre (King Lear, Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth) or the comedy/problem play category (The Tempest, Measure for Measure).

### Why Shakespeare? The Policy Rationale

Successive governments have justified Shakespeare's compulsory status through appeals to cultural literacy, literary heritage, and the development of analytical skills. The Cox Report (1989) established the pattern, arguing that Shakespeare represented "the pinnacle of English literary achievement." Subsequent curriculum reviews have reinforced this position despite periodic debates about decolonising the curriculum or diversifying the literary canon.

Contemporary justifications emphasise:
- **Linguistic richness**: Shakespeare's inventive use of vocabulary, metaphor, and rhetorical patterning
- **Universal themes**: Exploration of power, love, identity, and conflict that transcends historical context
- **Dramatic craft**: Understanding of plot construction, character development, and theatrical technique
- **Cultural reference**: Recognition of Shakespearean allusion in contemporary media and discourse

## Key Stage 2: First Encounters with Shakespeare

### Pedagogical Principles

The Primary Shakespeare Company and RSC research emphasise that early encounters should prioritise enjoyment, active engagement, and narrative understanding over linguistic analysis. The RSC's "Time to Act" study (2019) demonstrated significant improvements in children's language development, writing quality, and social-emotional skills when taught through active, drama-based approaches.

**Core Principles for KS2:**

1. **Story first**: Children must understand the plot, characters, and dramatic situation before encountering original language
2. **Embodied learning**: Physical movement, role-play, and performance activities help children inhabit the text
3. **Selective quotation**: Focus on key speeches and exchanges rather than whole scenes
4. **Modern parallels**: Explicit connections to contemporary experiences and popular culture

### Recommended Plays and Approaches

**Most Suitable Plays for KS2:**

| Play | Rationale | Key Themes |
|------|-----------|------------|
| *A Midsummer Night's Dream* | Magical elements, clear plot, ensemble cast | Transformation, dreams, love |
| *The Tempest* | Island setting, magic, Prospero as storyteller | Forgiveness, power, colonisation |
| *Macbeth* | Atmospheric, supernatural elements, moral trajectory | Ambition, guilt, consequences |
| *Romeo and Juliet* | Young protagonists, clear emotional journey | Love, conflict, fate |

**Practical Classroom Strategies:**

**Drama-Based Approaches:**
- **Hot-seating**: Children question characters in-role to explore motivation
- **Conscience alley**: The class voices a character's conflicting thoughts as they walk between two lines
- **Tableau**: Groups create frozen images of key moments
- **Whoosh**: A dynamic storytelling technique where children enter the playing space to enact scenes narrated by the teacher

**Language-Focused Activities:**
- **Word webs**: Exploring Shakespearean vocabulary thematically (e.g., words for anger in *Macbeth*)
- **Insult generators**: Using Shakespeare's inventive compound words and insults to demystify the language
- **Soundscapes**: Creating atmospheric audio for the heath in *King Lear* or the forest in *A Midsummer Night's Dream*

### The Transition to Key Stage 3

By the end of Year 6, pupils should have developed:
- Familiarity with Shakespeare's narrative conventions (the five-act structure, soliloquy, dramatic irony)
- Confidence in handling unfamiliar vocabulary through context
- Positive associations with Shakespearean study
- Basic understanding of theatrical context (Globe Theatre, original performance conditions)

Common misconceptions to address:
- Shakespeare wrote "in Old English" (it is actually Early Modern English)
- Shakespeare is always serious/boring
- Shakespeare's language is too difficult for children
- The plays were written to be read rather than performed

## Key Stage 3: Building Foundation Knowledge

### Curriculum Requirements

The National Curriculum for Key Stage 3 English requires pupils to study "two plays by Shakespeare." Schools typically distribute these across Years 7-9, with the first encounter often in Year 7 and the second in Year 9 as preparation for GCSE.

### Pedagogical Approaches

The RSC's "rehearsal room pedagogy" provides the dominant framework for KS3 Shakespeare teaching. This approach treats the classroom as a creative space where pupils explore the text through performance-based activities rather than beginning with written analysis.

**The RSC Active Approach:**

1. **Language as dramatic action**: Words are explored for what characters are trying to achieve, not merely what they mean
2. **Speaking the text aloud**: All pupils engage with the verse through choral speaking, pair work, and performance
3. **Collaborative interpretation**: Multiple valid readings are encouraged; the teacher facilitates rather than dictates interpretation
4. **Theatrical context**: Understanding of staging, audience, and original performance conditions informs textual study

**The Globe Theatre Education Programme** complements RSC approaches, offering:
- Workshops at the reconstructed Globe
- Playing Shakespeare with Deutsche Bank (free resources and productions for schools)
- Emphasis on the relationship between actor and audience in the open-air theatre

### Typical KS3 Programme of Study

**Year 7: Introduction to Shakespeare**

Many schools select *A Midsummer Night's Dream* or *The Tempest* for Year 7, capitalising on the plays' accessibility and magical elements. The focus is on:
- Plot comprehension and character relationships
- Exploring key scenes through drama
- Introduction to iambic pentameter and verse structure
- Understanding of Shakespeare's world and theatre

**Year 8: Developing Analytical Skills**

Year 8 might study a history play (*Richard III*, *Henry V*) or a comedy (*Much Ado About Nothing*, *Twelfth Night*). Pedagogical emphasis shifts toward:
- Character analysis supported by textual evidence
- Exploration of themes across the play
- Introduction to dramatic irony and audience knowledge
- Comparison of different productions and interpretations

**Year 9: Preparation for GCSE**

The Year 9 Shakespeare unit typically foreshadows GCSE requirements. Many schools begin studying their GCSE text in the summer term of Year 9. Focus areas include:
- Close analysis of Shakespeare's language (imagery, word choice, sound patterning)
- Contextual understanding (social, historical, theatrical)
- Essay structure and analytical writing
- Examination question practice

### Common Pedagogical Challenges at KS3

**Challenge: Linguistic accessibility**
*Solution*: The RSC advocates "letting the language do the work"—pupils learn meaning through speaking and contextual inference rather than vocabulary lists or modernised versions.

**Challenge: Engagement with reluctant learners**
*Solution*: Active, physical approaches that get pupils on their feet; connections to contemporary adaptations and popular culture; selection of relevant, engaging plays.

**Challenge: Assessment pressure**
*Solution*: Maintaining creative, exploratory approaches alongside development of analytical writing; avoiding premature examination focus in Years 7-8.

## Key Stage 4: GCSE Study and Examination Preparation

### Specification Requirements

All GCSE English Literature specifications require study of at least one complete Shakespeare play. The three major English awarding bodies (AQA, Edexcel, OCR) structure their Shakespeare assessment similarly:

**AQA (8702)**
- Paper 1: Shakespeare and the 19th-Century Novel
- Section A: Shakespeare (34 marks, 45 minutes recommended)
- Closed book assessment
- Choice of six plays: *Macbeth*, *Romeo and Juliet*, *The Tempest*, *The Merchant of Venice*, *Much Ado About Nothing*, *Julius Caesar*

**Edexcel (1ET0)**
- Component 1: Shakespeare and Post-1914 Literature
- Section A: Shakespeare (35 marks, 50 minutes recommended)
- Closed book
- Choice of five plays including *Macbeth*, *The Tempest*, *Romeo and Juliet*, *Othello*

**OCR (J352)**
- Component 2: Exploring Poetry and Shakespeare
- Shakespeare questions worth 25% of total GCSE
- Closed book
- Choice of plays including *Romeo and Juliet*, *The Merchant of Venice*, *Macbeth*, *Much Ado About Nothing*

### Assessment Objectives

GCSE English Literature assessment is structured around four Assessment Objectives (AQOs), with Shakespeare questions drawing particularly on AO1, AO2, and AO3:

| AO | Description | Typical Weighting |
|----|-------------|-------------------|
| AO1 | Read, understand and respond to texts | 20-30% |
| AO2 | Analyse language, form and structure | 40-50% |
| AO3 | Show understanding of contexts | 20-30% |
| AO4 | Use a range of vocabulary and sentence structures | Assessed across both papers |

### Popular Set Text Choices

Analysis of entry data reveals clear preferences among schools:

**AQA 2024 Entry Patterns:**
- *Macbeth*: Approximately 75% of candidates
- *Romeo and Juliet*: Approximately 20% of candidates
- *The Tempest*, *Much Ado About Nothing*, *Julius Caesar*, *The Merchant of Venice*: Combined less than 5%

This concentration raises questions about curriculum diversity and whether the most popular choices best serve all learners. Some educators argue that *Macbeth*'s popularity reflects its manageability (relatively short, clear plot, supernatural elements) rather than its inherent superiority for pedagogical purposes.

### Teaching Approaches at GCSE

**Balancing Active Learning and Examination Preparation:**

Research by Gibson and Douglas (2023) found that many teachers report tension between their preferred active, creative approaches and the perceived demands of examination preparation. However, the RSC and other organisations argue that deep understanding developed through performance-based study ultimately produces better examination performance than purely analytical approaches.

**Effective GCSE Pedagogy Includes:**

1. **Whole-text understanding**: Ensuring students can trace plot, character development, and theme across the complete play, not just studied scenes

2. **Language analysis skills**: Developing precise vocabulary for discussing Shakespeare's techniques (antithesis, soliloquy, dramatic irony, iambic pentameter, etc.)

3. **Contextual knowledge**: Teaching relevant social, historical, and theatrical context as specified by exam boards (Jacobean politics, attitudes to gender, witchcraft, etc.)

4. **Examination technique**: Practising essay structure, time management, and response to specific question formulations

5. **Multiple interpretations**: Encouraging awareness that Shakespeare's plays support diverse readings, including those informed by critical theory

### Common Misconceptions at GCSE

Students entering GCSE study often hold misconceptions that inhibit effective analysis:

- **Shakespeare's views = characters' views**: Confusing authorial perspective with dramatic representation
- **Context as bolt-on**: Treating historical context as separate from textual analysis rather than integrated
- **Character as real person**: Analysing characters as if they were real individuals with psychological depth beyond the dramatic construction
- **One correct interpretation**: Believing there is a single "right" reading that the examiner wants

## Key Stage 5: Critical Study at A-Level

### Specification Overview

A-Level English Literature specifications (AQA, Edexcel, OCR, Eduqas) offer considerable flexibility in Shakespeare selection. Unlike GCSE, there is no prescribed list; centres choose texts appropriate to their cohort and teaching expertise.

**Popular A-Level Choices:**

| Play | Genre | Common Pairings |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| *King Lear* | Tragedy | Comedy of the same period; modern tragedy |
| *Hamlet* | Tragedy | Metaphysical poetry; Gothic literature |
| *Othello* | Tragedy | The Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale; modern drama |
| *Antony and Cleopatra* | Tragedy | Romantic poetry; modernist literature |
| *The Tempest* | Romance/Comedy | Post-colonial literature; other island narratives |
| *Measure for Measure* | Problem play | Victorian literature; crime writing |

### Assessment Requirements

A-Level assessment builds upon GCSE foundations while demanding greater sophistication:

**AQA Specification A (7712):**
- Section A of Paper 1 (Love Through the Ages) or Paper 2 (Texts in Shared Contexts)
- Open book assessment (clean copies permitted)
- Comparative question with unseen element or second text

**Assessment Objectives at A-Level:**

| AO | Description | Emphasis |
|----|-------------|----------|
| AO1 | Articulate informed, personal and creative responses | Sustained critical argument |
| AO2 | Analyse ways meanings are shaped | Sophisticated exploration of authorial methods |
| AO3 | Explore significance of contextual factors | Complex understanding of literary, social, historical contexts |
| AO4 | Explore connections across texts | Meaningful comparison of interpretations |
| AO5 | Explore literary concepts and genres | Understanding of tragedy, comedy, dramatic conventions |

### Critical Approaches at A-Level

A-Level study introduces students to critical perspectives and theoretical frameworks:

**Feminist Criticism:**
Examining representations of gender, patriarchal structures, and the position of women in Shakespeare's society and dramaturgy. Key questions include: How do Shakespeare's female characters negotiate power within constrained circumstances? What is the significance of cross-dressing in the comedies?

**Marxist Criticism:**
Exploring class relations, economic structures, and the representation of power. Particularly relevant for history plays (*Henry V*, *Richard III*) and tragedies involving social ambition (*Macbeth*, *Coriolanus*).

**Post-Colonial Criticism:**
Reading *The Tempest* through the lens of colonialism and cultural encounter; examining representations of the "other" in *Othello* and *The Merchant of Venice*.

**Performance Criticism:**
Analysing the text as script rather than literature; considering how stage history and directorial choices construct meaning.

**New Historicism:**
Reading Shakespeare within the specific historical moment of production, attending to the plays' engagement with contemporary political and social debates (succession, religious conflict, gender anxiety).

### Developing Independent Critical Voices

A-Level pedagogy aims to develop students who can:
- Formulate original arguments supported by textual evidence
- Engage with critical views, agreeing, challenging, or modifying them
- Recognise the constructed nature of literary interpretation
- Write sustained, coherent analytical essays under timed conditions

**Transition Pedagogy:**
Many centres begin A-Level Shakespeare with close textual analysis of extracts (practising AO2 skills) before moving to whole-text study incorporating critical perspectives (AO3, AO4, AO5).

## Cross-Cutting Pedagogical Themes

### The Language Question

The linguistic distance between Early Modern English and contemporary usage represents the most persistent challenge in Shakespeare education. Research by the RSC and others suggests that approaches which confront this challenge directly—through speaking, performance, and contextual inference—prove more effective than those which attempt to circumvent it through simplified texts or extensive pre-reading explanation.

**Effective Language Strategies:**
- **Choral speaking**: Whole-class reading of key speeches builds confidence and reveals rhythmic patterns
- **Iambic pentameter work**: Physicalising the heartbeat rhythm (de-DUM de-DUM) helps students feel the verse
- **Punctuation exploration**: Shakespeare's original punctuation provides performance clues; students learn to follow the breathing
- **Word fields**: Tracing semantic clusters (light/dark imagery in *Romeo and Juliet*, blood in *Macbeth*) across the play

### Active vs. Analytical Approaches

The debate between active/drama-based pedagogy and analytical/text-focused study has characterised Shakespeare education for decades. The RSC's "rehearsal room" approach represents a synthesis: performance-based exploration that generates analytical
