# Vocabulary Instruction in English Teaching

## Introduction

Vocabulary knowledge is fundamental to academic success across all subjects. As Alex Quigley argues in *Closing the Vocabulary Gap* (2018), word knowledge is "critical for success in every subject" and essential for pupils to "communicate with confidence in the world beyond the school gates." The 2019 Ofsted Education Inspection Framework places significant emphasis on vocabulary development, expecting schools to demonstrate "clear progression of vocabulary throughout each of the different areas and not just English." Similarly, the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) Literacy Guidance Reports for Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 highlight vocabulary instruction as a priority area for improving pupil outcomes.

This knowledge file explores evidence-based approaches to vocabulary instruction, including Isabel Beck's influential Three Tier Model, the teaching of morphology and etymology, strategies for creating word-rich environments, and explicit instruction techniques that can be deployed across all key stages.

## The Three Tier Model of Vocabulary

### Origins and Rationale

Isabel Beck, alongside Margaret McKeown and Linda Kucan, developed the Three Tier Model of Vocabulary, first articulated in their seminal work *Bringing Words to Life* (2002). This framework provides teachers with a systematic approach for selecting which words to teach explicitly, based on their utility and frequency in academic and everyday contexts.

Beck's model emerged from research into what she terms "robust vocabulary instruction"—approaches that "involve directly explaining the meaning of words along with thought-provoking, playful, and interactive follow-up." The Three Tier Model has become foundational to vocabulary pedagogy in both the United States and the United Kingdom, informing programmes such as Bedrock Learning and influencing the EEF guidance on literacy.

### Tier 1: Basic Vocabulary

**Characteristics:**
- Words encountered frequently in everyday spoken language
- Typically acquired through conversation and everyday experience
- Examples: *house*, *run*, *happy*, *book*, *water*

**Pedagogical Implications:**
Tier 1 words generally require minimal explicit instruction for native speakers, as children acquire these through normal social interaction. However, teachers should remain alert to gaps in Tier 1 knowledge, particularly for:
- Pupils with English as an Additional Language (EAL)
- Children from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds who may have experienced "word poverty"
- Pupils with speech, language, and communication needs (SLCN)

For these pupils, targeted support to build Tier 1 vocabulary remains essential before moving to more academic language.

### Tier 2: High-Utility Academic Vocabulary

**Characteristics:**
- Words found frequently in written texts and academic discourse
- Cross-curricular utility—valuable across multiple subject domains
- Not typically acquired through everyday conversation
- Examples: *analyse*, *consequence*, *establish*, *significant*, *theory*, *evaluate*, *justify*

**Pedagogical Implications:**
Tier 2 words represent the priority target for explicit vocabulary instruction. Beck argues that these words offer the greatest return on investment for teaching time because they appear across the curriculum and unlock academic texts.

**Selection Criteria:**
When selecting Tier 2 words for explicit instruction, teachers should consider:
1. **Frequency**—How often does the word appear in academic texts?
2. **Utility**—Can the word be applied across different subjects and contexts?
3. **Conceptual importance**—Does understanding the word unlock key curriculum concepts?
4. **Instructional potential**—Can the word be explored through rich definition, examples, and non-examples?

**Instructional Approach:**
Beck advocates "robust instruction" for Tier 2 words, characterised by:
- Direct explanation of meaning (not merely dictionary definitions)
- Exploration of word usage in varied contexts
- Interactive and playful engagement with the word
- Multiple exposures over time (distributed practice)
- Opportunities for pupils to use the word in their own speaking and writing

### Tier 3: Domain-Specific Vocabulary

**Characteristics:**
- Words specific to particular subjects, topics, or domains
- Low frequency outside their specific context
- Essential for understanding specialised texts and concepts
- Examples in English: *metaphor*, *stanza*, *iambic*, *onomatopoeia*; in Science: *photosynthesis*, *molecule*, *velocity*

**Pedagogical Implications:**
Tier 3 words require direct and explicit instruction, often accompanied by definitions, diagrams, or contextual examples. Unlike Tier 2 words, which pupils should acquire for broad academic use, Tier 3 words are typically taught as part of specific curriculum units.

Teachers should be strategic about which Tier 3 words to prioritise, focusing on those that:
- Are essential for understanding the current unit of study
- Will recur throughout the curriculum (not one-off technical terms)
- Connect to Tier 2 words, reinforcing broader vocabulary networks

### Practical Application of the Three Tier Model

**Classroom Strategies:**

1. **Text Selection for Vocabulary Analysis**
   When preparing to teach a text, teachers can categorise unfamiliar vocabulary into tiers:
   - Identify Tier 1 words that may need brief clarification only
   - Select 5-10 Tier 2 words for robust instruction
   - Note Tier 3 words that require domain-specific teaching

2. **Cross-Curricular Coordination**
   Given that Tier 2 words cross subject boundaries, schools should consider:
   - Mapping Tier 2 vocabulary across the curriculum
   - Ensuring consistent definitions and approaches
   - Providing multiple exposures to the same word in different contexts

3. **Word Consciousness**
   The Three Tier Model itself builds "word consciousness"—helping pupils become aware of words as objects of study and interest, not merely tools for communication.

## Morphology and Etymology

### Understanding Morphology

Morphology refers to the study of the structure of words—the meaningful units (morphemes) that combine to create meaning. As Alex Quigley notes, morphology is "one of the most enduring teaching strategies, for almost every classroom at every key stage."

**Key Concepts:**

**Morphemes** are the smallest units of meaning in a language:
- **Free morphemes** can stand alone as words (e.g., *book*, *run*, *happy*)
- **Bound morphemes** must attach to other units (e.g., prefixes *un-*, *re-*; suffixes *-ness*, *-tion*)

**Types of Bound Morphemes:**
1. **Inflectional morphemes**—change grammatical function without altering core meaning
   - *-s* (plural), *-ed* (past tense), *-ing* (present participle), *-er* (comparative)

2. **Derivational morphemes**—create new words with different meanings
   - Prefixes: *un-* (not), *re-* (again), *pre-* (before), *dis-* (opposite)
   - Suffixes: *-ful* (full of), *-less* (without), *-tion* (act/process), *-able* (capable of)

### Teaching Morphology Effectively

Research from the Institute for Multi-Sensory Education (IMSE) and others suggests the following principles for morphology instruction:

**1. Extend to Include Etymology**
Understanding word origins (etymology) reinforces morphological knowledge. When pupils learn that *telephone* derives from Greek *tele* (far) + *phone* (sound), they can apply this knowledge to *television*, *telescope*, *telegram*, and *teleport*.

**2. Integrate with Subject Learning**
Morphology should not be taught in isolation but integrated with subject content. For example:
- In History: *democracy* (Greek *demos* = people, *kratos* = power)
- In Science: *photosynthesis* (Greek *photo* = light, *synthesis* = putting together)
- In Geography: *subterranean* (Latin *sub* = under, *terra* = earth)

**3. Use Inquiry-Based Approaches**
Encourage pupils to investigate word structure:
- "What does *unhappiness* mean? How do the parts help us?"
- "How does adding *-less* change *hope*?"
- "What other words use the root *struct* (build)?"

**4. Teach Free and Bound Bases**
Beyond affixes (prefixes and suffixes), teach pupils to recognise bases:
- Free base: *struct* appears in *structure*, *construct*, *destructive*
- Bound base: *mit* (send) appears in *transmit*, *submit*, *emit*, *admit*

**5. Use Morphological Matrices**
Rather than teaching isolated morphemes, use matrices to show word families:

```
         un-
          |
     re- -struct- -ion
          |        |
         de-     -ural
          |
        con-
```

This generates: *restructure*, *deconstruct*, *construction*, *structural*, *unstructured*, etc.

### Understanding Etymology

Etymology—the study of word origins—provides powerful tools for vocabulary expansion. The 2019 Ofsted framework and EEF guidance have elevated etymology as a key strategy for vocabulary instruction.

**Why Etymology Matters:**

1. **Memory Aid**
   Stories about word origins create memorable hooks. Pupils remember that *salary* derives from Latin *salarium* (salt allowance paid to Roman soldiers) because the story is unusual and vivid.

2. **Pattern Recognition**
   Understanding Latin and Greek roots reveals connections between seemingly unrelated words:
   - *Port* (carry): *transport*, *export*, *portable*, *porter*, *importance* (originally "carrying weight")

3. **Spelling Support**
   Etymology explains seemingly irregular spellings:
   - *Debt* has a silent 'b' because scholars reinserted it to reflect Latin *debitum*
   - *Island* has a silent 's' by false analogy with Latin *insula* (it actually derives from Old English *iegland*)

**Common Etymological Roots:**

**Latin Origins:**
Many English academic words derive from Latin, particularly those related to:
- Law and government (*justice*, *legislate*, *senate*)
- Education (*curriculum*, *discipline*, *study*)
- Abstract concepts (*liberty*, *equality*, *justice*)

**Greek Origins:**
Greek roots dominate scientific and technical vocabulary:
- Science terms (*biology*, *geology*, *psychology*)
- Medical terms (*cardiac*, *neural*, *orthopaedic*)
- Mathematical terms (*geometry*, *arithmetic*, *hypotenuse*)

**Anglo-Saxon Origins:**
Everyday vocabulary often derives from Old English:
- Core vocabulary (*house*, *home*, *friend*, *love*)
- Concrete nouns and action verbs (*run*, *eat*, *sleep*, *walk*)

**Teaching Etymology in Practice:**

**Vocabulary Programmes:**
Resources like Vocabulous provide structured approaches to teaching etymology and morphology, enabling teachers to deliver "fun for students" whilst building the "resources they need to be confident teaching etymology and morphology."

**Word Maps:**
Create visual displays showing word families derived from common roots:
- Root: *spect* (look)
- Family: *inspect*, *spectacle*, *spectator*, *prospect*, *retrospect*, *circumspect*, *perspective*

**Etymological Investigations:**
Encourage pupils to research word origins using etymological dictionaries (such as the Online Etymology Dictionary). This builds independent word-learning strategies.

## Creating Word-Rich Environments

### The Concept of Word Consciousness

Alex Quigley emphasises the importance of creating "word-rich classrooms where students deconstruct vocabulary and build knowledge." A word-rich environment goes beyond vocabulary lists and explicit lessons—it cultivates what researchers call "word consciousness": an awareness of and interest in words, their meanings, and their power.

**Characteristics of Word-Rich Environments:**

1. **Visible Language**
   - Word walls displaying Tier 2 and Tier 3 vocabulary
   - Etymological displays showing word origins
   - Morphological matrices that grow throughout the year
   - Subject-specific vocabulary in context, not isolated lists

2. **Language-Rich Interactions**
   - Teachers modelling sophisticated vocabulary
   - Pupil-to-pupil talk that uses academic language
   - Questioning that probes and extends vocabulary knowledge
   - Wait time that allows pupils to formulate precise responses

3. **Text-Rich Environments**
   - Wide range of high-quality texts available
   - Reading aloud that introduces vocabulary beyond pupils' independent reading level
   - Texts that deliberately repeat and reinforce target vocabulary

### Strategies for Building Word-Rich Classrooms

**1. Explicit Teacher Modelling**

Teachers should consciously model:
- **Think-alouds** when encountering unfamiliar words: "I'm not sure what *arduous* means. Let me look at the context..."
- **Word choice deliberation**: "Should I say *walked* or *trudged*? *Trudged* suggests it was difficult..."
- **Self-correction**: "Actually, *furious* is stronger than *angry*—let me use that instead."

**2. Wide Reading and Reading Aloud**

The Ofsted Early Reading guidance (2019) notes that inspectors "will ask staff what they read to children; the choice of stories, rhymes and poems and the songs they sing to develop children's vocabulary."

Effective practice includes:
- Reading aloud texts that exceed pupils' independent reading level
- Selecting texts that deliberately introduce Tier 2 vocabulary
- Discussing word choices during and after reading
- Creating classroom libraries with varied, vocabulary-rich texts

**3. Vocabulary Displays**

Visual supports for vocabulary should:
- Be purposeful and learning-focused, not merely decorative
- Show words in context, not in isolation
- Include etymological and morphological information
- Be referred to actively during teaching
- Be organised thematically or by subject area

**4. Word Play and Exploration**

Build enjoyment and curiosity about words through:
- **Word of the week** programmes exploring Tier 2 vocabulary
- **Etymology mysteries** investigating surprising word origins
- **Portmanteau creation** (combining words: *brunch*, *motel*)
- **Neologism discussions** (newly coined words)
- **Crossword and puzzle activities** that reinforce vocabulary

**5. Cross-Curricular Consistency**

Word-rich environments extend beyond the English classroom:
- Science teachers modelling precise technical vocabulary
- History teachers exploring semantic shifts (*revolution* has changed meaning over time)
- Art teachers discussing *texture*, *composition*, *perspective*
- All teachers reinforcing Tier 2 words taught in English lessons

### Addressing Word Poverty

Quigley's concept of "word poverty" refers to the significant gap in vocabulary knowledge between socioeconomically advantaged and disadvantaged pupils. Research suggests that by age 5, children from disadvantaged backgrounds may know 30 million fewer words than their peers.

**Strategies to Address Word Poverty:**

1. **Explicit and Repeated Instruction**
   - Ensure multiple exposures to new vocabulary (research suggests 12+ encounters for ownership)
   - Provide explicit instruction rather than incidental learning
   - Use cumulative curricula that revisit and build vocabulary

2. **Oral Language Development**
   - Prioritise speaking and listening, particularly in Early Years and Key Stage 1
   - Use structured talk activities (Talk for Writing, dialogic teaching)
   - Provide sentence stems and frameworks to support academic talk

3. **High-Quality Text Experiences**
   - Ensure access to vocabulary-rich texts
   - Use audiobooks to provide access to complex language
   - Read aloud daily across all key stages

4. **Home-School Partnerships**
   - Support parents to develop vocabulary at home
   - Provide guidance on reading aloud and conversation
   - Share word-rich activities for home completion

## Explicit Teaching Strategies

### Principles of Explicit Vocabulary Instruction

The EEF Literacy Guidance Reports emphasise that vocabulary should be taught explicitly, not left to incidental acquisition. Effective explicit instruction follows established principles from research:

**1. Select Words Strategically**
Use frameworks like Beck's Three Tiers to prioritise high-utility vocabulary. Focus on words that:
- Unlock understanding of curriculum content
- Appear frequently across academic texts
- Connect to existing vocabulary networks

**2. Provide Student-Friendly Definitions**

Avoid dictionary definitions, which are often circular or use more difficult language. Instead:
- Use everyday language pupils understand
- Provide concrete examples
- Connect to known concepts

Compare:
- *Dictionary definition*: "Arduous: involving or requiring strenuous effort; difficult and tiring."
- *Student-friendly*: "Arduous means something is very hard work and takes a lot of effort. Climbing a steep mountain is arduous."

**3. Explore Words in Context**

Present target words in varied contexts:
- The context from the current text being studied
- Examples from pupils' experience
- Contrasting examples (non-examples)
- Examples from different subject areas

**4. Engage Pupils Actively**

Move beyond passive listening to active engagement:
- **Say the word**: Pupils pronounce the word multiple times
- **Discuss examples**: Generate and evaluate examples and non-examples
- **Use the word**: Write sentences or explain concepts using the word
- **Word games**: Play charades, Pictionary, or concept sorts with vocabulary

**5. Provide Multiple Exposures**

Research suggests pupils need 10-12 meaningful exposures to a word before they truly own it. Plan for:
- Initial introduction with explicit definition
- Revis
