# A Level English Literature Curriculum Knowledge

## Overview

A Level English Literature is a two-year advanced qualification (AQA Specification B 7717) that develops sophisticated critical reading, analytical writing, and independent literary study. It represents a significant progression from GCSE, moving from guided text study to independent critical engagement, comparative analysis, and theoretical frameworks.

The qualification is designed for students to:
- Develop advanced skills in literary analysis and interpretation
- Engage with texts from different periods and genres independently
- Apply critical theory and different critical perspectives
- Conduct independent reading and research
- Write extended critical essays with academic rigour

Unlike English Language, which studies linguistic patterns and social contexts, Literature focuses on aesthetic appreciation, critical interpretation, and the exploration of how literary texts construct meaning through form, language and context.
