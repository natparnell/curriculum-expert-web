# Writing: Transcription, Composition, and Progression Across Key Stages

Writing is one of the two core strands of the National Curriculum for English in England, alongside reading. The curriculum defines writing as involving two distinct but interrelated processes: transcription (spelling and handwriting) and composition (articulating ideas and structuring them coherently for a reader). Understanding the relationship between these processes, the progression of writing skills from Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) through to Key Stage 5, and effective pedagogical approaches is essential for teachers seeking to develop confident, capable, and motivated writers.

## The Simple View of Writing

The National Curriculum's conceptualisation of writing draws upon the Simple View of Writing, originally proposed by Berninger and colleagues (2002) and subsequently adapted for educational contexts. This framework provides a powerful model for understanding the component skills involved in writing and their developmental trajectory.

### The AMT Framework

The Simple View of Writing posits that writing proficiency depends on three interacting components, often referred to as AMT:

- **Automaticity of Transcription Skills (A):** This encompasses handwriting fluency and spelling automaticity. When transcription becomes automatic, cognitive resources are freed for higher-level composition processes. The DfE (2014) emphasises that "writing also depends on fluent, legible and, eventually, speedy handwriting."

- **Management of Writing Processes (M):** This refers to the executive functions required to plan, draft, revise, and edit text. It involves strategic decision-making about content, organisation, and style.

- **Translation of Ideas into Text (T):** This is the compositional act itself—transforming mental representations into written language through vocabulary and grammatical choices.

Berninger's research demonstrates that weaknesses in any of these areas can impede overall writing development. Of particular importance is the finding that transcription skills must reach a threshold of automaticity before they cease to constrain composition. This has significant implications for curriculum sequencing and intervention design.

### Implications for Teaching

The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) notes that the Simple View of Writing "gives us a framework to see the full picture, so we can intervene effectively and prevent these challenges from becoming barriers to long-term success." Teachers should:

- Assess component skills separately to identify specific barriers
- Prioritise transcription automaticity in early stages
- Maintain composition practice even while developing transcription skills
- Ensure that transcription practice is purposeful and connected to meaning-making

## Transcription: Spelling and Handwriting

Transcription—the physical and orthographic encoding of language—forms the foundation upon which composition rests. The National Curriculum programmes of study for writing at key stages 1 and 2 explicitly divide transcription into spelling and handwriting.

### Spelling

The National Curriculum emphasises that pupils should learn to spell quickly and accurately through "knowing the relationship between sounds and letters (phonics) and understanding the morphology (word structure) and orthography (spelling structure) of words."

#### Phonics and Early Spelling

In the early stages, spelling development is intimately connected to phonics instruction. The DfE's emphasis on systematic synthetic phonics reflects research showing that explicit teaching of sound-letter correspondences provides the foundation for spelling accuracy. However, spelling development extends beyond phonics to encompass:

- **Phonological awareness:** The ability to segment words into phonemes
- **Morphological knowledge:** Understanding how prefixes, suffixes, and root words combine
- **Orthographic knowledge:** Recognition of spelling patterns and conventions
- **Etymological awareness:** Understanding word origins, particularly useful for Latinate and Greek-derived vocabulary

#### Developmental Stages of Spelling

Research by Henderson (1985) and subsequent scholars identifies distinct stages of spelling development:

1. **Pre-communicative stage:** Mark-making and letter-like forms
2. **Semi-phonetic stage:** Initial and sometimes final sounds represented
3. **Phonetic stage:** All salient sounds represented, often unconventionally
4. **Transitional stage:** Visual patterns and conventional spellings emerge
5. **Conventional stage:** Standard spelling predominantly used

Teachers should recognise these stages as developmental milestones rather than errors to be corrected, while providing targeted instruction to move pupils toward conventional spelling.

### Handwriting

Handwriting instruction has received renewed attention in recent years, with growing recognition that fluency of handwriting affects compositional quality. The National Handwriting Association (NHA) emphasises that handwriting is "a means of expressing language" and that efficient handwriting "releases cognitive resources for compositional processes."

#### National Curriculum Expectations

The National Curriculum sets clear handwriting expectations:

- **Year 1:** Sit correctly at a table, holding a pencil comfortably and correctly; begin to form lower-case letters in the correct direction, starting and finishing in the right place
- **Year 2:** Form lower-case letters of the correct size relative to one another; start using some of the diagonal and horizontal strokes needed to join letters
- **Years 3-4:** Use the diagonal and horizontal strokes that are needed to join letters and understand which letters, when adjacent to one another, are best left unjoined; increase the legibility, consistency, and quality of their handwriting
- **Years 5-6:** Write legibly, fluently, and with increasing speed by choosing which shape of a letter to use when given choices and deciding whether or not to join specific letters

#### The Relationship Between Handwriting and Composition

Research by Medwell and Wray (2014) and others demonstrates that handwriting fluency correlates with compositional quality. Pupils with slow or effortful handwriting produce shorter, less complex texts. This suggests that:

- Handwriting should be taught explicitly and practised regularly
- Fluency development should be prioritised alongside legibility
- Technology (typing) may provide appropriate accommodation for pupils with persistent handwriting difficulties

## Composition: Planning, Drafting, and Editing

Composition—the creation and organisation of ideas for a reader—represents the higher-order dimension of writing. The National Curriculum defines effective composition as "involving forming, articulating and communicating ideas, and then organising them coherently for a reader. This requires clarity, awareness of the audience, purpose and context, and an increasingly wide knowledge of vocabulary and grammar."

### The Writing Process

Contemporary writing pedagogy emphasises teaching writing as a process rather than a product. The Writing For Pleasure Centre (Young and Ferguson, 2020) identifies distinct components of the writing process that should be taught explicitly:

#### Generating Ideas

Before writing can begin, writers must have something to say. Effective writing teachers provide:

- Rich experiences and stimuli (visits, objects, discussions, reading)
- Time for thinking and talking before writing
- Strategies for generating ideas (brainstorming, mind-mapping, freewriting)
- Personal writing territories—topics and genres that interest individual writers

Young and Ferguson emphasise that "writers learn by learning about writing," suggesting that immersion in mentor texts and writing processes is essential.

#### Planning

Planning involves making decisions about content, structure, and development before drafting. The National Curriculum expects pupils to "plan their writing by:

- Discussing writing similar to that which they are planning to write in order to understand and learn from its structure, vocabulary and grammar
- Discussing and recording ideas"

As pupils progress, planning becomes increasingly internalised and sophisticated, involving decisions about genre conventions, paragraph structure, and rhetorical organisation.

#### Drafting

Drafting is the initial translation of ideas into text. Effective drafting pedagogy recognises that:

- First drafts are provisional and imperfect
- Fluency should be prioritised over accuracy during drafting
- Writing can be recomposed and reorganised in subsequent drafts
- Sustained writing time is essential for developing writing stamina

#### Revising and Editing

The distinction between revising (making changes to meaning, organisation, and development) and editing (correcting surface features such as spelling and punctuation) is important pedagogically. The National Curriculum expects pupils to:

- "Evaluate their writing by assessing the effectiveness of their own and others' writing"
- "Propose changes to vocabulary, grammar and punctuation to enhance effects and clarify meaning"
- "Ensure the consistent and correct use of tense throughout a piece of writing"
- "Ensure correct subject and verb agreement when using singular and plural"

Peer evaluation and response are valuable strategies for developing critical awareness and providing authentic audience feedback.

#### Publishing

Making writing public—through display, performance, or publication—provides purpose and motivation. The Writing For Pleasure Centre notes that publication "gives children a sense of themselves as writers" and creates authentic contexts for writing.

### Teaching the Writing Process

The EEF's guidance on writing emphasises that effective writing teachers:

- Model each stage of the writing process explicitly
- Provide scaffolded practice at each stage
- Gradually release responsibility to independent application
- Connect process instruction to authentic writing purposes

## Writing Purposes and Audiences

Writing is always situated within communicative contexts involving particular purposes and audiences. The National Curriculum identifies a range of text types and purposes that pupils should encounter and produce across their school careers.

### Primary Phase Purposes

At Key Stages 1 and 2, pupils are expected to write for a range of purposes, including:

- **Writing to entertain:** Narratives, stories, poetry, playscripts
- **Writing to inform:** Instructions, explanations, non-chronological reports
- **Writing to persuade:** Advertisements, persuasive letters, arguments
- **Writing to discuss:** Balanced arguments, discussion texts

The curriculum emphasises that pupils should "consider how authors have developed characters and settings in what pupils have read, listened to or seen performed" when writing narratives, and should "use the organisational and language features of non-fiction texts" when writing to inform or persuade.

### Secondary Phase Purposes

At Key Stages 3 and 4, the range of purposes expands to include:

- **Discursive writing:** Extended arguments, critical essays, analytical responses
- **Transactional writing:** Formal letters, speeches, articles, reports
- **Creative writing:** Extended narratives, descriptive writing, non-fiction creative forms

GCSE English Language examinations (AQA, Eduqas, OCR, Pearson) assess writing through both creative/descriptive and transactional tasks. Examination boards emphasise the importance of:

- Adaptation of tone, register, and style to audience and purpose
- Structural organisation for rhetorical effect
- Linguistic and rhetorical devices used purposefully

The Eduqas specification, for example, notes that "writers use language and structural features to deliberately appeal to their intended audience."

### Genre Knowledge

Effective writing requires knowledge of genre conventions—the typical patterns of organisation, language features, and stylistic choices associated with particular text types. The National Curriculum's emphasis on reading-writing connections recognises that:

- Reading mentor texts within a genre provides models for writing
- Explicit analysis of genre features supports transfer to writing
- Innovation within genres requires secure understanding of conventions

## Progression in Writing: EYFS to KS5

Writing development is a long-term process involving qualitative changes in the nature of writing, the processes employed, and the metacognitive awareness of writers.

### Early Years Foundation Stage

The EYFS Framework (2021) identifies literacy as one of the seven areas of learning, with writing as a component of the Literacy early learning goal. In the EYFS, writing is conceptualised broadly to encompass:

- **Physical foundations:** Fine motor development, pencil grip, mark-making
- **Compositional foundations:** Articulating ideas and structuring them in speech, before writing
- **Phonological foundations:** Phonological awareness for early spelling attempts

The DfE's "Help for early years providers" guidance emphasises that "writing involves transcription (spelling and handwriting) and composition (articulating ideas and structuring them in speech, before writing)." This reflects the same conceptual structure as the Key Stage 1-2 curriculum, appropriately adapted for younger children.

Effective early writing provision includes:

- Rich mark-making opportunities across the learning environment
- Role-play areas that generate purposeful writing contexts
- Adult modelling of writing in meaningful contexts
- Encouragement of children's own compositions alongside age-appropriate transcription skills

### Key Stage 1 (Years 1-2)

At Key Stage 1, the curriculum priorities are:

- Establishing accurate and automatic phonics for spelling
- Developing legible and fluent handwriting
- Beginning to understand the writing process
- Writing for a range of purposes with increasing independence

The DfE Writing Framework (2025) provides detailed guidance on expected standards at the end of Key Stage 1, emphasising that pupils should be able to write narratives, non-fiction texts, and poetry, demonstrating the transcriptional and compositional skills outlined in the programmes of study.

### Key Stage 2 (Years 3-6)

Key Stage 2 represents a period of consolidation and expansion:

- Transcription skills become increasingly automatic
- Composition involves longer and more complex texts
- Awareness of audience, purpose, and register develops
- Self-regulation of the writing process increases

The grammar, punctuation, and spelling programmes of study are applied in writing contexts, with pupils expected to "use and understand the grammatical terminology... accurately and appropriately when discussing their writing."

The end of Key Stage 2 teacher assessment of writing involves assessment against detailed criteria covering both transcription and composition. Research by Clarkson (2024) and others has highlighted tensions between these prescribed criteria and teachers' broader conceptions of "good writing," suggesting the importance of maintaining space for creative and personal expression alongside technical accuracy.

### Key Stage 3 (Years 7-9)

At Key Stage 3, pupils are expected to:

- "Write accurately, fluently, effectively and at length for pleasure and information"
- "Adapt their writing for a wide range of purposes and audiences"
- "Select, and use judiciously, grammar, vocabulary, and orthographic features"

The curriculum emphasises the integration of writing skills across the curriculum, noting that pupils should "write effectively for a range of purposes and audiences" in subjects beyond English.

### Key Stage 4 and 5 (Years 10-13)

At Key Stage 4, writing development is shaped significantly by GCSE specifications. Both English Language and English Literature require sophisticated writing skills:

- **English Language:** Creative and transactional writing under examination conditions
- **English Literature:** Critical, analytical, and evaluative essay writing

At Key Stage 5, A-Level English specifications (AQA, OCR, Eduqas, Pearson) require:

- Extended analytical and discursive writing
- Independent research and critical argumentation
- Sophisticated awareness of academic conventions and register

## Pedagogical Approaches

Research and professional consensus, including Ofsted's English Research Review (2022), the EEF's guidance, and the work of NATE, identify several evidence-informed approaches to teaching writing effectively.

### Reading-Writing Connections

The relationship between reading and writing is bidirectional and mutually reinforcing. The National Curriculum's structure reflects this, with reading providing models and vocabulary for writing, and writing deepening comprehension of textual features. Effective practice includes:

- Using mentor texts to teach genre features
- Analysing authorial craft before writing
- Connecting writing tasks to texts read
- Reading aloud to develop ear for written language

### The Role of Oral Language

Talk is essential to writing development. The curriculum's emphasis on discussion, drama, and presentation recognises that:

- Articulating ideas orally precedes and supports written composition
- Collaborative planning and peer response develop critical awareness
- Reading aloud supports revision and editing

### Process Writing and Writing Workshop

Process writing approaches provide sustained time for writing within supportive classroom communities. Key features include:

- Extended writing time (minimum 30-45 minutes)
- Mini-lessons focused on specific craft techniques
- Conferring with individual writers
- Peer collaboration and response
- Publication and celebration of finished work

Young and Ferguson's (2020) Writing for Pleasure pedagogy synthesises research on effective writing teaching into fourteen interconnected principles, including:

- Teaching writing as a craft
- Creating a community of writers
- Providing choice and agency
- Setting authentic purposes and audiences
- Teaching the writing processes
- Providing constructive response

### Balanced Instruction

Effective writing teaching balances:

- **Explicit instruction:** Direct teaching of strategies, skills, and conventions
- **Modelling:** Demonstration of writing processes and craft techniques
- **Scaffolded practice:** Supported application with gradual release
- **Independent writing:** Authentic, self-directed composition
- **Collaborative writing:** Shared and paired composition activities

## Common Misconceptions and Challenges

Understanding typical misconceptions and difficulties helps teachers anticipate and address barriers to writing development.

### Transcription Barriers

- **Spelling anxiety:** Fear of spelling errors can inhibit composition
- **Handwriting fatigue:** Slow or effortful handwriting limits output
- **Phonological difficulties:** Weak phonological awareness impedes spelling development

### Compositional Challenges

- **Generating ideas:** "I don't know what to write" is a common obstacle
- **Organising ideas:** Structuring extended texts presents cognitive demands
- **Audience awareness:** Writing for readers rather than oneself requires development

### Pedagogical Misconceptions

Research and inspection evidence suggest some common misconceptions in writing pedagogy:

- **Over-emphasis on transcription:** Excessive focus on correctness can inhibit composition
- **Formulaic approaches:** Rigid structures can limit development of authentic voice
- **Isolated skill teaching:** Decontextualised grammar instruction shows limited transfer
- **Insufficient writing time:** Without sustained composition, skills cannot develop

Ofsted's English Research Review (2022) notes that "appropriate pedagogies" vary by age and developmental stage, with basic skills requiring more explicit instruction and older pupils benefiting from more sophisticated analysis of genre and craft.

## Conclusion

Writing is a complex, cognitively demanding activity that develops gradually across the school years and beyond. The National Curriculum's conceptualisation of writing as comprising transcription and composition, informed by the Simple View of Writing and research on the writing process, provides a coherent framework for curriculum design and pedagogy.

Effective writing teaching requires attention to:

- Developing automatic transcription skills that free cognitive resources for composition
- Teaching writing as a process involving planning, drafting, revising, and editing
- Providing authentic purposes and audiences for writing
- Making explicit connections between reading and writing
- Balancing explicit instruction with meaningful, sustained composition
- Recognising and addressing the developmental nature of writing proficiency

The goal is not merely technical accuracy but the development of confident, capable writers who can use writing effectively for
