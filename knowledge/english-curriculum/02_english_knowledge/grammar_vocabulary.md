# Grammar and Vocabulary in the English National Curriculum

## Overview

The English National Curriculum places significant emphasis on the explicit teaching of grammar and vocabulary from the earliest stages of primary education through to Key Stage 3. This statutory requirement, detailed primarily in **English Appendix 2: Vocabulary, Grammar and Punctuation**, provides a structured progression that enables pupils to develop conscious control over their use of language. The overarching aim is to equip pupils with a strong command of spoken and written English, ensuring they can communicate ideas fluently while understanding the grammatical structures that underpin effective communication.

Grammar teaching in the National Curriculum is designed to be integrated within the broader context of reading and writing, rather than taught as an isolated set of rules. As the Department for Education (DfE, 2014) guidance emphasises, pupils should be taught to use grammatical terminology accurately and appropriately when discussing their own writing and the texts they encounter. This metalinguistic awareness—the ability to talk about language itself—supports pupils in becoming more sophisticated users and analysts of English.

## The Structure of Appendix 2

English Appendix 2 provides a comprehensive overview of the grammatical features that should be included in teaching across Key Stages 1 and 2. The appendix is organised to show clear progression, with content specified for each year group or pair of year groups (Years 1-2, Years 3-4, Years 5-6). This structure ensures that grammatical knowledge builds systematically, with each phase preparing pupils for the increasing complexity they will encounter in the next.

The appendix covers six main areas: word classes, sentence structure, verb forms and tenses, punctuation, vocabulary, and standard English. Within each area, the progression is carefully calibrated. For example, Year 1 pupils focus on recognising basic word classes (nouns, verbs, adjectives) and simple sentence punctuation, whilst by Year 6, pupils are expected to understand complex grammatical concepts including modal verbs, relative clauses, and the subjunctive form.

Importantly, the National Curriculum stipulates that grammar should be taught explicitly, with pupils learning both the concepts and the terminology required to discuss them. This approach marks a significant shift from earlier frameworks where grammatical knowledge was often acquired implicitly through reading and writing activities alone.

## Word Classes: The Foundation of Grammatical Understanding

### Nouns

Nouns are introduced in Year 1 as naming words, with pupils learning to distinguish between common nouns (general names such as "dog" or "city") and proper nouns (specific names such as "London" or "Mr Smith"). Proper nouns are distinguished by their use of capital letters, a convention that pupils must master early.

By Year 2, pupils encounter the concept of **expanded noun phrases**, where adjectives or additional nouns modify the head noun (e.g., "the fierce lion" or "the glass window"). This understanding is extended in Years 3-4 to include prepositional phrases that post-modify nouns (e.g., "the book on the table").

Years 5-6 introduce more sophisticated noun-related concepts including abstract nouns (names for concepts such as "courage" or "freedom") and the use of noun phrases for concision and stylistic effect. Pupils learn how nominalisation—turning verbs or adjectives into nouns—can alter the tone and emphasis of their writing.

### Verbs

Verbs form a central strand of grammatical progression throughout the primary years. In Year 1, pupils learn that verbs are "doing" or "being" words, with focus on present and past tense forms. The curriculum emphasises that many common verbs have irregular past tense forms (e.g., "go/went", "see/saw") that must be learnt individually.

Year 2 builds on this foundation with the introduction of **progressive aspect** (also known as continuous tenses), showing how "-ing" forms combine with auxiliary verbs to indicate ongoing actions (e.g., "She is running"). Pupils also encounter the concept of verb tense consistency within sentences and short texts.

The Years 3-4 programme of study extends verb knowledge significantly. Pupils learn about the **perfect form** (e.g., "I have eaten", "They had left"), which expresses completed actions with present or past relevance. Modal verbs—auxiliary verbs expressing possibility, necessity, or obligation (can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, would)—are introduced, enabling pupils to express degrees of certainty and hypothetical situations.

By Years 5-6, pupils encounter the **subjunctive mood**, used in formal contexts to express hypothetical or desirable situations (e.g., "If I were Prime Minister...", "I suggest that he be recalled"). They also study the **passive voice**, understanding how it shifts focus from the agent to the action or recipient (e.g., "The cake was eaten" versus "I ate the cake"), and learn to use this construction appropriately for formal and scientific writing.

### Adjectives and Adverbs

Adjectives are introduced in Year 1 as describing words that modify nouns. The curriculum emphasises how adjectives add detail and precision to writing. By Year 2, pupils learn that multiple adjectives can be used together within expanded noun phrases.

Adverbs enter the curriculum in Year 2, initially introduced as words that describe how actions are performed (e.g., "quickly", "slowly"). Years 3-4 extend this to include adverbs of time (e.g., "yesterday", "tomorrow") and place (e.g., "here", "outside"), as well as degrees of possibility (e.g., "perhaps", "certainly").

By Years 5-6, pupils explore how adverbs can modify not only verbs but also adjectives and other adverbs, creating subtle gradations of meaning. They learn to recognise and use adverbs for cohesion, linking ideas across paragraphs and texts.

### Determiners and Pronouns

Determiners—words that introduce nouns and indicate quantity, possession, or specificity—are formally introduced in the Years 3-4 programme. Pupils learn to distinguish between articles ("a", "an", "the"), demonstratives ("this", "that", "these", "those"), and possessive determiners ("my", "your", "his", "her", "its", "our", "their"). The curriculum emphasises that quantifiers such as "some", "many", "few", and "all" also function as determiners.

Pronouns, introduced progressively from Year 1, replace nouns to avoid repetition and improve flow. Year 1 pupils learn personal pronouns ("I", "you", "he", "she", "it", "we", "they"), whilst Year 2 introduces possessive pronouns ("mine", "yours", "his", "hers", "ours", "theirs"). Years 3-4 add relative pronouns ("who", "which", "where", "when", "whose", "that"), which introduce relative clauses providing additional information about nouns.

By Years 5-6, pupils understand how pronouns contribute to cohesion and clarity within and across sentences. They learn to ensure pronoun reference is unambiguous and to use a range of pronoun types to create sophisticated, varied writing.

### Conjunctions

Conjunctions are the glue that holds sentences together, and their progressive introduction reflects the increasing complexity of pupils' writing. In Year 1, pupils learn to join words and clauses using "and", with Year 2 extending this to include "but", "or", "when", "if", "that", and "because".

The Years 3-4 programme distinguishes between **coordinating conjunctions** ("and", "but", "or", "nor", "yet", "so") which join clauses of equal status, and **subordinating conjunctions** ("when", "if", "because", "although", "while", "since", "until", "before", "after") which introduce dependent clauses. This distinction is crucial for understanding sentence structure and developing complex sentences.

By Years 5-6, pupils are expected to use a wide range of conjunctions with confidence, understanding how different choices create different logical relationships between ideas and contribute to the overall coherence of their writing.

### Prepositions

Prepositions, introduced in Years 3-4, express relationships of time, place, or cause between elements in a sentence. Pupils learn how prepositions (e.g., "in", "on", "at", "by", "with", "through", "during", "before", "after") combine with nouns or noun phrases to form prepositional phrases that add detail and precision to writing.

The curriculum emphasises that prepositions can have multiple meanings depending on context (e.g., "at" in "at the shop" versus "at 3 o'clock" versus "angry at someone"), and that learning these varied uses expands pupils' expressive range.

## Sentence Structure and Variety

### Simple Sentences

The National Curriculum begins with simple sentences containing a single clause. Year 1 pupils learn that a simple sentence typically consists of a subject and a predicate, with the subject being a noun phrase and the predicate containing a verb and often additional elements. This foundational understanding supports all subsequent sentence-level learning.

### Compound Sentences

Compound sentences, introduced in Years 3-4, join two or more main clauses of equal grammatical status using coordinating conjunctions or semicolons. Pupils learn that compound sentences enable the expression of linked but independent ideas, and that the choice of conjunction affects the logical relationship conveyed (addition with "and", contrast with "but", alternatives with "or").

The semicolon is introduced as a more sophisticated way of joining closely related main clauses, particularly where the relationship is one of contrast or elaboration without an explicit conjunction.

### Complex Sentences

Complex sentences, containing a main clause and one or more subordinate clauses, are central to the Years 3-6 curriculum. The subordinate clause may function as an adverbial (providing information about time, place, manner, cause, or condition), a relative clause (modifying a noun), or a nominal clause (functioning as subject or object).

**Adverbial clauses**, introduced through subordinating conjunctions, add layers of contextual information to main clauses. Pupils learn that these clauses can be positioned flexibly within sentences (at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end), and that different positions create different emphases.

**Relative clauses**, introduced in Years 5-6 using relative pronouns, provide additional information about nouns. The curriculum distinguishes between **defining relative clauses** (essential to identifying which noun is meant, with no commas) and **non-defining relative clauses** (providing supplementary information, set off by commas).

### Sentence Types

The National Curriculum requires pupils to recognise and use four sentence types:

1. **Statements** (declarative): Making assertions or providing information
2. **Questions** (interrogative): Seeking information, introduced by question words or inversion
3. **Commands** (imperative): Giving instructions, typically using the base form of the verb
4. **Exclamations** (exclamatory): Expressing strong feeling, often beginning with "What" or "How"

Understanding these sentence types enables pupils to vary their writing for effect and to match form to purpose and audience.

## Verb Forms and Tenses

### Tense and Aspect

The English verb system combines **tense** (when an action occurs: past, present, future) with **aspect** (how the action relates to time: simple, progressive, perfect). The National Curriculum ensures pupils understand these combinations systematically.

The **simple aspect** presents actions as complete wholes ("I walk", "I walked"). The **progressive aspect** (also called continuous) presents actions as ongoing or in progress ("I am walking", "I was walking"). The **perfect aspect** presents actions as completed with relevance to another time point ("I have walked", "I had walked").

By Years 5-6, pupils are expected to use these aspects accurately and to understand how aspectual choices affect meaning. They learn, for example, that "I ate" (simple past) presents a completed action, whilst "I was eating" (past progressive) presents an action as a background to other events.

### Modal Verbs and Expressing Possibility

Modal verbs occupy a significant place in the upper primary curriculum. These auxiliary verbs (can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, would) express degrees of possibility, necessity, ability, and obligation.

The curriculum emphasises that modal verbs have only one form (no "-s" ending for third person singular, no infinitive "to", no past participle) and that they are followed by the base form of the main verb. Pupils learn how different modals express different degrees of certainty ("It might rain" versus "It will rain") and different kinds of necessity ("You must leave" versus "You should leave").

### The Subjunctive Mood

The subjunctive mood, introduced in Years 5-6, represents the most advanced verb form in the primary curriculum. Used in formal contexts to express hypothetical, desirable, or hypothetical situations, the subjunctive appears in set phrases ("God save the Queen", "come what may") and in formal constructions following certain verbs and conjunctions ("I suggest that he be recalled", "If I were you").

Pupils learn that the subjunctive often uses the base form of the verb regardless of subject ("It is essential that she arrive on time") and that it contributes to a formal, authoritative register appropriate for certain types of writing.

## Punctuation: From Basics to Sophistication

### Sentence Boundary Punctuation

Year 1 pupils begin with the fundamentals: capital letters for sentence beginnings and proper nouns, full stops to mark sentence endings, and question marks and exclamation marks for their respective sentence types. The curriculum emphasises that accurate sentence demarcation is foundational to clear communication.

### Commas

The comma has multiple functions that are introduced progressively:

- **Lists**: Separating items in a list (Year 2)
- **After fronted adverbials**: Marking a pause after sentence-opening phrases indicating time, place, or manner (Years 3-4)
- **Clauses**: Separating main and subordinate clauses, particularly when the subordinate clause comes first (Years 3-4)
- **Relative clauses**: Setting off non-defining relative clauses (Years 5-6)
- **Parenthesis**: Marking parenthetical elements that could be removed without affecting the sentence's grammatical completeness (Years 5-6)

### Apostrophes

The apostrophe has two distinct functions that pupils must learn to distinguish:

1. **Contraction**: Indicating omitted letters (e.g., "don't" for "do not", "can't" for "cannot")
2. **Possession**: Indicating belonging (e.g., "the girl's book", "the children's toys")

The curriculum addresses common confusions, including its/it's (possessive pronoun versus contraction of "it is") and plural possessives (e.g., "the girls' books" where the plural noun already ends in "s").

### Advanced Punctuation

Years 5-6 introduce more sophisticated punctuation marks:

- **Semicolons**: Joining closely related main clauses; separating items in complex lists
- **Colons**: Introducing lists or explanations; introducing direct speech or quotations
- **Dashes**: Creating informal parenthesis; marking sentence breaks
- **Hyphens**: Joining compound modifiers; preventing ambiguity
- **Bullet points**: Organising information clearly

## Morphology and Etymology

### Word Formation

From Year 3 onwards, the National Curriculum requires pupils to understand how words are formed through **morphology**—the study of word structure. Pupils learn to recognise and use common prefixes (e.g., "un-", "dis-", "mis-", "re-", "pre-", "anti-") and suffixes (e.g., "-ation", "-ous", "-ly", "-tion", "-sion", "-ness", "-ment", "-ful", "-less").

Understanding morphology supports both spelling and vocabulary development. Pupils learn that recognising morphemes (meaningful word parts) can help them decode unfamiliar words and predict spelling patterns.

### Etymology and Word Origins

The Years 5-6 programme of study explicitly requires pupils to use knowledge of **etymology** (word origins) to support their spelling and vocabulary. The curriculum highlights how English has borrowed extensively from other languages:

- **Anglo-Saxon roots**: Basic vocabulary and grammatical words (house, water, come, good)
- **Latin roots**: Often connected to academic and scientific vocabulary (audible, transport, spectator)
- **Greek roots**: Often connected to technical and scientific concepts (thermometer, biography, telephone)

Understanding etymology helps pupils make connections between related words, recognise spelling patterns, and appreciate the historical development of English. For example, knowing that "phone" comes from Greek for "sound" helps explain "telephone", "microphone", "phonics", and "euphonium".

## Vocabulary Development

### Word Meaning and Nuance

The National Curriculum emphasises that vocabulary development is inseparable from reading and writing. As pupils encounter increasingly complex texts, they should be taught strategies for working out word meanings from context, morphology, and etymology.

The curriculum highlights the importance of understanding **synonyms** (words with similar meanings) and **antonyms** (words with opposite meanings), as well as the nuances that distinguish near-synonyms. Pupils learn that word choice affects tone and register, and that selecting the most precise vocabulary enhances communication.

### Figurative Language

From Year 3 onwards, pupils are expected to recognise and use figurative language including **similes** (explicit comparisons using "like" or "as"), **metaphors** (implied comparisons), and **personification** (attributing human characteristics to non-human entities). Understanding figurative language enables pupils to appreciate the layers of meaning in literary texts and to enrich their own creative writing.

## Progression from KS1 to KS3: Key Transitions

### Key Stage 1 (Years 1-2): Foundations

At Key Stage 1, the focus is on establishing foundational grammatical knowledge. Pupils learn basic word classes, simple sentence structures, and fundamental punctuation. The emphasis is on accuracy in speech and writing, with grammar taught primarily through reading quality texts and applying understanding to pupils' own compositions.

Teachers should ensure that pupils can:
- Use capital letters and full stops consistently
- Distinguish between common and proper nouns
- Recognise and use basic adjectives and verbs
- Form simple questions using question words and question marks
- Join words and clauses using "and"

The expectation is that grammatical terminology should be introduced gradually and reinforced through application rather than memorisation in isolation.

### Lower Key Stage 2 (Years 3-4): Expanding Structures

The transition to Years 3-4 marks a significant expansion in grammatical complexity. Pupils are expected to move beyond simple sentences to compound and complex structures. The introduction of fronted adverbials, prepositional phrases, and subordinating conjunctions enables pupils to express more sophisticated relationships between ideas.

Key developments include:
- Understanding and using the perfect form of verbs
- Recognising and using paragraphs to organise ideas
- Introducing inverted commas for direct speech
- Using conjunctions to express time, place, and cause
- Beginning to understand word families and morphology

Teachers should provide explicit instruction in grammatical concepts whilst ensuring these are applied in meaningful contexts. The Englicious resource (UCL, 2024) emphasises that grammar should be taught explicitly at this stage, with pupils learning terminology and concepts set out in English Appendix 2 and able to apply them correctly to examples of real language.

### Upper Key Stage 2 (Years 5-6): Sophistication and Control

By Years 5-6, pupils are expected to demonstrate conscious control over their grammatical choices. They should understand how different structures create different effects and be able to select appropriately for purpose and audience. The introduction of advanced features such as the subjunctive mood, passive voice, and modal verbs enables pupils to express shades of meaning and adopt formal registers when appropriate.

Key expectations include:
- Using cohesive devices including adverbs and pronouns to link ideas across paragraphs
- Understanding and using relative clauses
- Recognising and using the subjunctive mood in formal contexts
- Converting between active and passive voice
- Using brackets, dashes, and commas for parenthesis

Pupils should also be developing their understanding of morphology and etymology to support spelling and vocabulary acquisition. By the end of Year 6, pupils should be prepared for the grammatical demands of secondary education.

### Key Stage 3: Consolidation and Extension

At Key Stage 3, pupils build upon their primary foundation, consolidating existing knowledge and encountering more sophisticated grammatical concepts. The focus shifts towards:

- **Extended and complex sentence structures**: Pupils encounter sentences with multiple subordinate clauses, embedded relative clauses, and sophisticated coordination
- **Register and formality**: Explicit attention to how grammatical choices signal formality, authority, and audience awareness
- **Literary and rhetorical grammar**: Understanding how authors use grammatical structures for stylistic effect
- **Critical language awareness**: Reflecting on how grammatical choices shape meaning and influence readers

The Key Stage 3 programme of study expects pupils to understand and use grammatical features such as extended noun phrases, complex subordination, and varied clause structures. Teachers should build upon primary foundations whilst introducing the analytical language needed for GCSE English Language and Literature study.

## Pedagogical Approaches to Grammar and Vocabulary Teaching

### Explicit Teaching within Meaningful Contexts

Effective grammar teaching, as recommended by the National Curriculum and supported by research from the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), combines explicit instruction with meaningful application. Rather than teaching grammar as an isolated set of rules, teachers should:

1. **Introduce concepts explicitly**: Use clear explanations and examples to establish understanding
2. **Model application**: Demonstrate how grammatical features work in authentic texts
3. **Provide scaffolded practice**: Support pupils in applying new structures in their own writing
4. **Encourage independent use**: Enable pupils to make conscious grammatical choices for effect

The "Getting to Grips with Grammar" guidance (Primary English Education Consultancy, 2022) recommends being selective in the elements of grammar taught, particularly in KS2 where the curriculum content is extensive. Focusing on features that will have the greatest impact on pupils' writing quality is more effective than attempting to cover everything superficially.

### Integrating Reading and Writing

Grammar and vocabulary development should be inseparable from reading and writing instruction. As pupils encounter grammatical structures in the texts they read, teachers should draw attention to how these structures function and the effects they create. This "reading like a writer" approach supports pupils in internalising structures before attempting to use them independently.

Similarly, when pupils write, teachers should use grammatical terminology to discuss their choices and suggest improvements. Rather than simply correcting errors, teachers should engage pupils in discussing how different grammatical choices would affect meaning and impact.

### Addressing Common Misconceptions

Certain grammatical concepts consistently cause confusion and require careful teaching:

**Word Classes**: Pupils often confuse adjectives with adverbs, or struggle to recognise verbs in different forms. Teachers should provide varied examples and non-examples to establish secure understanding.

**Pronoun Reference**: Ambiguous pronoun reference is a common issue in pupils' writing. Teaching should emphasise ensuring that readers can clearly identify what each pronoun refers to.

**Apostrophes**: The distinction between possessive apostrophes and contractions requires repeated reinforcement. Many pupils persistently confuse "its" and "it's" well into secondary school.

**Sentence Fragments and Run-ons**: Pupils may write fragments (incomplete sentences) or run-on sentences (multiple independent clauses joined without appropriate punctuation or conjunctions). Explicit teaching of sentence boundaries and the functions of different conjunctions supports accuracy.

### Supporting Vocabulary Development

Vocabulary teaching should be systematic and extensive. The National Curriculum emphasises that pupils should be taught to work out the meanings of unknown words through context, morphology, and etymology. Effective approaches include:

- **Direct instruction**: Teaching specific, ambitious vocabulary explicitly
- **Word webs and families**: Exploring morphological connections between words
- **Etymological investigations**: Understanding word origins to support spelling and meaning
- **Rich reading experiences**: Encountering vocabulary in varied, challenging contexts
- **Oral rehearsal**: Using new vocabulary in spoken contexts before written application

Research by Beck, McKeown, and Kucan (2013) distinguishes between Tier 1 (everyday), Tier 2 (high-utility academic), and Tier 3 (domain-specific) vocabulary. Teachers should prioritise Tier 2 words—those that appear frequently across academic domains but are unlikely to be acquired through conversation alone.

## Assessment and Progression Monitoring

### Grammar in National Assessments

Grammatical knowledge is assessed at the end of Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 through statutory assessments. The KS2 English Grammar, Punctuation and Spelling (GPS) test explicitly assesses pupils' understanding of the concepts outlined in English Appendix 2.

The GPS test includes:
- Multiple-choice questions on grammatical terminology
- Sentence completion and transformation tasks
- Punctuation exercises
- Spelling tests incorporating morphological and etymological patterns

Teachers should ensure that pupils are familiar with the formats used in these assessments whilst maintaining focus on genuine understanding rather than test technique alone.

### Ongoing Formative Assessment

Effective grammar teaching requires ongoing assessment of pupils' understanding and application. Teachers should:

- Monitor accuracy in pupils' independent writing
- Use focused punctuation and grammar exercises to check understanding
- Engage pupils in grammatical discussion about texts
- Provide targeted feedback that moves learning forward

Diagnostic assessment can identify specific misconceptions or gaps in knowledge, enabling targeted intervention where needed.

## Implications for Curriculum Planning

### Sequencing and Spiralling

Grammatical knowledge should be sequenced carefully, with foundational concepts established before more complex structures are introduced. However, effective curriculum planning also involves "spiralling"—revisiting concepts at increasing levels of sophistication throughout pupils' school careers.

For example, noun phrases are introduced in Year 2 as "expanded noun phrases" with adjectives, revisited in Years 3-4 with prepositional post-modification, and extended in Years 5-6 to include relative clauses. This spiralling approach reinforces learning whilst extending understanding.

### Cross-Curricular Application

Grammar and vocabulary teaching should not be confined to English lessons. Opportunities to apply grammatical knowledge across the curriculum—including in science, history, and geography—reinforce learning and demonstrate the relevance of grammatical accuracy in all forms of communication.

Teachers across the curriculum should be aware of the grammatical demands of their subjects and support pupils in meeting these demands. For example, scientific writing often requires the passive voice, whilst historical writing may require complex temporal subordination.

## Conclusion

The English National Curriculum's approach to grammar and vocabulary represents a comprehensive, progressive framework designed to equip pupils with conscious control over their language use. From the foundational word classes introduced in Year 1 to the sophisticated structures of Years 5-6 and beyond, the curriculum ensures systematic development of grammatical knowledge.

Success in grammar teaching requires balancing explicit instruction with meaningful application, integrating grammatical study with reading and writing, and maintaining high expectations for accuracy whilst fostering creativity and expression. When taught effectively, grammar becomes not a set of restrictive rules but a toolkit that empowers pupils to communicate precisely, effectively, and confidently across all contexts.
