# Spoken Language in the English National Curriculum

## Overview and Statutory Foundation

Spoken language occupies a pre-eminent position within the English National Curriculum, recognised not merely as a discrete domain but as the foundational capacity upon which all other aspects of literacy development rest. The Department for Education's statutory framework establishes that "spoken language underpins the development of reading and writing," emphasising that "the quality and variety of language that pupils hear and speak are vital for developing their vocabulary and grammar and their understanding for reading and writing."

The National Curriculum for English (2014) articulates a clear statutory entitlement for all pupils. Teachers must ensure "the continual development of pupils' confidence and competence in spoken language and listening skills." These requirements are not optional or supplementary; they form part of the statutory programmes of study that all maintained schools in England must follow. The spoken language requirements apply across all key stages, from the Early Years Foundation Stage through to Key Stage 4, with specific expectations detailed for each phase of education.

The overarching aims of the English curriculum explicitly include spoken language competency: pupils should "use discussion in order to learn; they should be able to elaborate and explain clearly their understanding and ideas" and "are competent in the arts of speaking and listening, making formal presentations, demonstrating to others and participating in debate." These aims recognise that spoken language serves dual purposes within education: learning to talk (developing oracy skills) and learning through talk (using dialogue as a mechanism for cognitive development).

### Statutory Requirements Across Key Stages

The National Curriculum outlines specific statutory requirements for spoken language that span the entire primary phase. In Key Stage 1 (Years 1 and 2), pupils must be taught to:

- Listen and respond appropriately to adults and their peers
- Ask relevant questions to extend their understanding and knowledge
- Use relevant strategies to build their vocabulary
- Articulate and justify answers, arguments and opinions
- Give well-structured descriptions, explanations and narratives for different purposes, including for expressing feelings
- Maintain attention and participate actively in collaborative conversations, staying on topic and initiating and responding to comments
- Use spoken language to develop understanding through speculating, hypothesising, imagining and exploring ideas
- Speak audibly and fluently with an increasing command of Standard English
- Participate in discussions, presentations, performances, role play, improvisations and debates
- Gain, maintain and monitor the interest of the listener(s)
- Consider and evaluate different viewpoints, attending to and building on the contributions of others
- Select and use appropriate registers for effective communication

These requirements are not presented as a checklist to be worked through sequentially but as interconnected competencies that develop simultaneously. The statutory framework recognises that spoken language development is recursive rather than linear; pupils return to and refine capabilities as they encounter increasingly complex content and contexts.

At Key Stage 2 (Years 3-6), the statutory requirements build upon the foundations established in Key Stage 1, expecting greater sophistication in application. Pupils should continue to develop these skills across the range of subjects studied, not only in English lessons. This cross-curricular application is significant: it positions spoken language as a transferable competence that supports learning across the curriculum, rather than a subject-specific skill confined to English lessons.

## The Oracy Framework: Physical, Linguistic, Cognitive and Social-Emotional Dimensions

Contemporary understanding of spoken language development has been significantly advanced by the Oracy Framework developed by Voice 21 in partnership with Oracy Cambridge. This framework provides a comprehensive structure for understanding what constitutes effective speaking and listening across different educational contexts. It identifies four distinct but interlinked strands that together constitute oracy capability.

### Physical Strand

The physical dimension of oracy encompasses the vocal and bodily resources that speakers deploy in communication. This includes voice projection and clarity, tone and intonation patterns, pace and pause, and non-verbal communication including gesture, facial expression and posture. Voice 21's framework emphasises that these physical elements are not superficial additions to spoken communication but integral components that shape meaning and impact.

In classroom practice, the physical strand requires explicit teaching. Pupils need opportunities to develop their capacity to vary volume appropriately for different contexts, from intimate pair discussions to whole-class presentations. They must learn to use intonation to convey meaning, distinguishing between declarative statements and questions through tone. The ability to modulate pace—slowing for emphasis, accelerating to convey excitement—represents a sophisticated physical skill that enhances communicative effectiveness.

Gesture and eye contact form part of the physical repertoire. Teachers should model and teach pupils how to use gesture purposefully rather than distractingly, and how to maintain appropriate eye contact that signals engagement and confidence without discomfort. These physical elements are particularly important in performance contexts, where drama and presentation skills demand conscious control of the body as an instrument of communication.

### Linguistic Strand

The linguistic strand addresses the words, phrases and rhetorical strategies that speakers employ. This encompasses vocabulary selection, grammatical structures, rhetorical devices and register adaptation. The National Curriculum's emphasis on "increasing command of Standard English" positions linguistic competence as a central expectation, whilst also recognising the value of understanding and deploying different registers appropriately.

Vocabulary development represents a critical component of the linguistic strand. Research consistently demonstrates the relationship between vocabulary breadth and academic achievement. The spoken language curriculum must therefore prioritise the explicit teaching of vocabulary, including subject-specific terminology and academic language. Voice 21's framework emphasises that vocabulary should not be taught as isolated word lists but encountered and practised through meaningful oral contexts.

Rhetorical strategies including questioning, argumentation, explanation and narration require explicit instruction. Pupils need to understand how to structure arguments logically, how to use connectives to signal relationships between ideas, and how to adapt language choices for different audiences and purposes. These linguistic capabilities develop through scaffolded practice in discussion, debate and presentation contexts.

### Cognitive Strand

The cognitive dimension of oracy relates to the thinking and reasoning processes that underpin effective communication. This includes content selection and organisation, reasoning and critical thinking, and reflection and self-regulation. The National Curriculum's requirement that pupils "speculate, hypothesise, imagine and explore ideas" explicitly connects spoken language to cognitive development.

Content selection involves making choices about what to include and exclude in oral communication, considering the audience's needs and the communicative purpose. Organisation requires understanding how to sequence ideas coherently, using discourse markers and structural signals to guide listeners through complex information. These cognitive capabilities develop through planned talk activities where pupils must prepare and structure contributions in advance.

Reasoning and critical thinking are developed through argumentation and debate. Pupils learn to construct logical arguments, provide evidence to support claims, and evaluate the validity of opposing viewpoints. The National Curriculum's expectation that pupils "justify answers, arguments and opinions" positions reasoning as a core spoken language competency. Critical thinking extends to evaluating sources, identifying bias, and recognising rhetorical manipulation.

Reflection and self-regulation involve monitoring one's own speaking and listening, identifying areas for improvement, and adjusting communication strategies based on feedback. Metacognitive awareness of oracy—the ability to think about one's own talk—supports continued development across all four strands.

### Social-Emotional Strand

The social-emotional dimension recognises that all communication occurs within social contexts and involves emotional engagement. This strand encompasses confidence and self-esteem, empathy and emotional intelligence, and collaboration and community building. The National Curriculum's emphasis on "participating actively in collaborative conversations" acknowledges the social nature of spoken language.

Confidence and self-esteem are prerequisites for effective participation in spoken language activities. Pupils who lack confidence may remain silent or contribute minimally, limiting their opportunities for development. The curriculum must therefore include strategies for building confidence, including rehearsal opportunities, supportive peer structures, and graduated exposure to increasingly challenging speaking contexts.

Empathy and emotional intelligence involve understanding others' perspectives, recognising emotional states, and responding appropriately. These capabilities are developed through paired and group discussion where pupils must attend to others' contributions and build upon them. Drama activities are particularly powerful for developing empathy, as they require adopting different perspectives and responding in role.

Collaboration and community building involve establishing and maintaining productive relationships through talk. This includes turn-taking, active listening, acknowledging others' contributions, and managing disagreement constructively. The National Curriculum's requirement that pupils "attend to and build on the contributions of others" positions collaborative talk as a core competency.

## Dialogic Teaching: The Alexander Approach

Professor Robin Alexander's research on dialogic teaching has profoundly influenced contemporary understanding of classroom talk. Alexander distinguishes between rote, recitation, instruction, discussion and dialogue, arguing that genuine dialogue—where teachers and pupils explore ideas together—produces the most powerful learning outcomes. His work demonstrates that the quality of classroom talk is at least as important as the quantity.

### The Five Principles of Dialogic Teaching

Alexander identifies five core principles that characterise dialogic classrooms:

**Collective**: Classroom activities are conducted through talk among teachers and pupils, rather than being solitary or individual endeavours. Learning is understood as a social process that occurs through interaction.

**Reciprocal**: Participants listen to each other, share ideas and consider alternative viewpoints. Dialogue is not a series of isolated contributions but a genuine exchange where ideas are developed through response and counter-response.

**Supportive**: The classroom environment supports pupils in articulating their ideas, including those who may struggle to express themselves. Teachers scaffold participation so that all pupils can contribute meaningfully.

**Cumulative**: Teachers and pupils build upon their own and each other's contributions, chaining contributions into coherent lines of thinking. Ideas are not simply listed but developed and refined through collective consideration.

**Purposeful**: Classroom talk, though sometimes open-ended, is nevertheless structured with specific learning goals in view. Dialogue is not idle conversation but purposeful intellectual activity directed towards educational objectives.

### Implementing Dialogic Teaching in Practice

Implementing dialogic teaching requires more than simply encouraging discussion. Teachers must develop specific strategies for eliciting extended contributions, probing understanding, and facilitating peer-to-peer dialogue. Alexander's research identifies several key teaching moves:

**Eliciting**: Using open questions that invite extended responses rather than closed questions that require minimal answers. Eliciting moves invite pupils to explain, elaborate and justify their thinking.

**Probing**: Following up initial responses with questions that deepen understanding. Probing moves might ask for clarification, evidence, examples or implications.

**Expanding**: Building upon pupil contributions to develop ideas further. Expanding moves demonstrate how contributions connect to broader concepts or disciplinary knowledge.

**Linking**: Connecting contributions across the class, showing how different pupils' ideas relate to each other. Linking moves build collective understanding and model respectful engagement with multiple perspectives.

The Education Endowment Foundation's randomised controlled trial of Alexander's dialogic teaching intervention (2014-2017) demonstrated statistically significant positive effects on pupil attainment, particularly for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. This evidence base establishes dialogic teaching as a high-impact approach to developing spoken language and learning through talk.

## Drama and Performance in the Spoken Language Curriculum

Drama occupies a distinctive position within the spoken language curriculum. Although drama is not a discrete National Curriculum subject at Key Stages 1-3, it is a statutory component of English under the spoken language requirements. The curriculum specifies that "all pupils should be enabled to participate in and gain knowledge, skills and understanding associated with the artistic practice of drama."

### Statutory Drama Requirements

The National Curriculum outlines specific drama expectations that apply across key stages. Pupils should be able to "adopt, create and sustain a range of roles, responding appropriately to others in role." This requirement encompasses character embodiment, improvisation and the capacity to maintain dramatic focus across extended sequences.

The curriculum further specifies that pupils should "have opportunities to improvise, devise and script drama for one another and a range of audiences." This recognises the full creative process, from spontaneous improvisation through collaborative devising to working with scripted material. The specification of "a range of audiences" acknowledges that dramatic communication varies depending on whether the audience is peers, younger children, parents or the wider community.

Performance and response are equally emphasised. Pupils should "rehearse, refine, share and respond thoughtfully to drama and theatre performances." This positions performance as a process requiring preparation and polish, and establishes audience response as an active, analytical activity rather than passive consumption.

### Progression in Drama Across Key Stages

Drama progression can be conceptualised across three interrelated strands: making drama, performing, and responding. These strands, identified by the Arts Council and embedded in quality drama provision, provide a framework for planning and assessment.

**Key Stage 1**: Drama at this stage is characterised by playful exploration and imaginative engagement. Pupils use role-play to explore familiar and imaginary scenarios, developing their capacity to adopt and sustain simple roles. Performance is typically informal and collaborative, with emphasis on participation and enjoyment rather than polished presentation. Response focuses on personal enjoyment and simple evaluative comments.

**Lower Key Stage 2**: Pupils develop greater control over dramatic elements, beginning to use voice, gesture and movement consciously to convey character and situation. Improvisation becomes more structured, with pupils contributing to collaboratively devised scenes. Performance may involve simple scripting and rehearsal. Response becomes more analytical, with pupils able to identify what worked effectively and suggest improvements.

**Upper Key Stage 2**: Drama work becomes more sophisticated in concept and execution. Pupils engage with complex themes and more challenging texts, using drama to explore social and moral issues. Performance demonstrates greater technical control and awareness of audience. Response includes critical evaluation using appropriate vocabulary, and pupils can articulate how dramatic techniques create meaning.

**Key Stage 3**: Although outside the primary phase, understanding KS3 expectations informs effective upper KS2 provision. At this stage, pupils encounter drama as a distinct subject with specialised knowledge and skills. They engage with theatrical traditions, explore different genres and styles, and develop understanding of theatrical production elements. Performance demonstrates polish and sophistication appropriate to public presentation.

### Drama Pedagogy: Process and Product

Effective drama teaching balances process and product. Process drama prioritises the experiential learning that occurs during dramatic exploration; product drama emphasises the development of performance for audience. Both have legitimate places within the curriculum.

Process drama, associated with theorists such as Dorothy Heathcote and Gavin Bolton, uses dramatic frameworks to explore curriculum content and social issues. In process drama, pupils may remain in role for extended periods, exploring situations and dilemmas from within the fiction. This approach develops empathy, ethical reasoning and collaborative problem-solving alongside spoken language capabilities.

Product drama focuses on developing performance skills and creating work for audience. This approach builds technical competence, including vocal projection, spatial awareness and stagecraft. It also develops resilience and confidence through the challenge of public performance.

Quality drama provision incorporates both approaches, using process drama to explore content deeply and product drama to develop performance skills and share learning with others.

## Discussion and Debate: Developing Argumentative Capability

The National Curriculum explicitly requires that pupils participate in "discussions, presentations, performances, role play, improvisations and debates." Debate represents the most formal and structured of these activities, requiring sophisticated argumentative capabilities that develop progressively across the primary years.

### The Components of Argumentative Competence

Argumentative competence encompasses multiple interconnected capabilities:

**Claim formulation**: The ability to articulate a clear position or proposition. This requires understanding what constitutes a debatable claim as opposed to a statement of fact or expression of preference.

**Evidence provision**: The capacity to support claims with relevant evidence. This involves selecting appropriate evidence, establishing its credibility, and connecting it logically to the claim it supports.

**Reasoning and warranting**: The ability to explain how evidence supports claims through logical reasoning. This includes recognising and articulating the underlying assumptions that connect evidence to conclusions.

**Counter-argumentation**: The capacity to anticipate and address opposing viewpoints. This requires understanding multiple perspectives and identifying weaknesses in alternative positions.

**Refutation**: The ability to respond effectively to counter-arguments, either by conceding valid points or demonstrating flaws in opposing reasoning.

### Progression in Debate Skills

Debate capability develops through carefully structured progression:

**KS1**: Informal discussion where pupils express and justify opinions. Simple agree/disagree activities with reasons. Circle time structures that encourage turn-taking and respectful disagreement.

**Lower KS2**: Structured discussion with formal rules for contribution. Four-corner debates where pupils physically position themselves according to their stance and justify their positioning. Simple formal debates with opening statements and rebuttals.

**Upper KS2**: Full formal debates following parliamentary or competitive formats. Extended argumentation with multiple points and evidence. Sophisticated rebuttal that addresses specific points in opposing arguments.

### Teaching Discussion and Debate

Effective discussion and debate teaching requires explicit instruction in both the structures of formal argument and the social norms of constructive disagreement. Teachers should model argumentative discourse, making their thinking visible as they construct and evaluate arguments.

Ground rules for discussion must be established and reinforced. These typically include: listening actively to others, building on previous contributions rather than simply waiting to speak, expressing disagreement respectfully, and supporting claims with reasons and evidence. These norms must be taught explicitly and reinforced consistently.

Scaffolded frameworks support pupils in developing argumentative competence. Sentence starters such as "I agree with X because...", "I see your point, however...", and "The evidence suggests that..." provide linguistic structures that pupils can adopt and internalise. Visual organisers help pupils structure arguments systematically, ensuring that claims, evidence and reasoning are connected coherently.

## Progression in Spoken Language Across Key Stages

Understanding progression is essential for effective curriculum planning and assessment. The National Curriculum provides statutory endpoints but does not specify detailed progression; teachers must interpret how capabilities develop from early childhood through to secondary transition.

### Early Years Foundation Stage

Although the EYFS is distinct from the National Curriculum, it establishes foundations upon which later spoken language development builds. The EYFS framework emphasises communication and language as a prime area of learning, recognising its foundational importance for all other learning.

In the EYFS, spoken language development focuses on:

- **Listening and attention**: Developing the capacity to listen attentively in a range of situations, including sustaining concentration during stories and instructions.
- **Understanding**: Following instructions involving several ideas or actions, and responding appropriately to questions about experiences and stories.
- **Speaking**: Expressing ideas and feelings using complete sentences, and using talk to organise thinking and clarify understanding.

These early capabilities provide the foundation for the more sophisticated spoken language competencies expected at Key Stage 1 and beyond. Effective transition from EYFS to Year 1 requires understanding these foundations and building upon them systematically.

### Key Stage 1: Building Foundational Competence

At Key Stage 1, spoken language development focuses on establishing core competencies that will be refined throughout the primary years. The statutory requirements emphasise active participation in collaborative conversations, with pupils learning to stay on topic, initiate responses and maintain attention.

Key developments at this stage include:

- **Extended discourse**: Moving from single-word or phrase responses to complete sentences and extended contributions. Pupils learn to provide well-structured descriptions and explanations.
- **Social conventions**: Developing understanding of turn-taking, appropriate interruption, and polite disagreement. These social norms of conversation must be taught explicitly.
- **Register variation**: Beginning to recognise that language choices vary depending on context and audience. Pupils might experiment with more formal language during class presentations.
- **Metacognitive awareness**: Developing capacity to reflect on their own speaking and listening, identifying what they do well and what they find challenging.

Assessment at Key Stage 1 should focus on participation and engagement rather than polished performance. The goal is to build confidence and establish positive attitudes towards spoken language activities.

### Lower Key Stage 2: Developing Articulacy and Control

Lower Key Stage 2 represents a period of consolidation and refinement. Pupils build upon foundational competencies, developing greater control over the physical, linguistic and cognitive dimensions of oracy.

Key developments include:

- **Increased complexity**: Pupils engage with more demanding content, requiring more sophisticated vocabulary and grammatical structures to express increasingly complex ideas.
- **Planned speech**: Greater emphasis on prepared contributions, with pupils learning to structure talks and presentations systematically.
- **Collaborative skills**: More sophisticated participation in group discussion, including building upon others' contributions, managing disagreement, and working towards collective outcomes.
- **Performance skills**: Development of more polished presentation capabilities, including appropriate use of voice, gesture and eye contact.

The cross-curricular nature of spoken language becomes increasingly important at this stage. Pupils should be using spoken language to explore, clarify and demonstrate learning across the curriculum, not only in English lessons.

### Upper Key Stage 2: Sophistication and Independence

Upper Key Stage 2 prepares pupils for the demands of secondary education. Spoken language activities become more demanding, with expectations for independent preparation and sophisticated execution.

Key developments include:

- **Extended argumentation**: Pupils engage with complex debates and discussions, constructing and evaluating sophisticated arguments.
- **Formal presentation**: Development of confident, polished presentation skills appropriate for a range of audiences and purposes.
- **Critical engagement**: Capacity to evaluate others' contributions critically, identifying strengths, weaknesses and areas for development.
- **Self-regulation**: Independence in monitoring and improving their own spoken language, setting personal targets and working towards them systematically.
- **Disciplinary variation**: Understanding how spoken language varies across subjects, adapting communication strategies for scientific discussion, historical enquiry, mathematical reasoning and other disciplinary contexts.

By the end of Key Stage 2, pupils should be confident, articulate speakers who can participate effectively in a range of spoken language contexts and who recognise the value of oracy for learning and for life.

## Common Misconceptions and Challenges

Effective spoken language teaching requires awareness of common misconceptions that pupils hold and challenges that they face.

### Misconceptions About Spoken Language

**"Good talkers talk a lot"**: Pupils may equate effective spoken language with quantity rather than quality. Teachers must emphasise that effective communication involves listening as much as speaking, and that concise, well-chosen contributions often have more impact than extended monologues.

**"There's one right way to speak"**: Pupils may believe that Standard English represents the only acceptable form of spoken language. While the National Curriculum expects increasing command of Standard English, effective spoken language teaching also recognises the value of language variety and the importance of code-switching appropriately.

**"Speaking just happens"**: Pupils (and sometimes teachers) may view spoken language as natural rather than learned. This misconception undermines the value of explicit teaching. While all children acquire language naturally, the sophisticated oracy competencies required for academic success must be taught explicitly.

### Common Challenges

**Anxiety and reticence**: Many pupils experience anxiety about speaking in front of others. This may manifest as complete refusal to participate or as minimal, hesitant contributions. Addressing anxiety requires creating supportive environments, providing rehearsal opportunities, and scaffolding participation so that all pupils can experience success.

**Limited vocabulary**: Vocabulary gaps can severely constrain pupils' capacity to express complex ideas. Vocabulary must be taught explicitly, with opportunities to encounter and use new words in meaningful oral contexts.

**Difficulty with abstract concepts**: Spoken language development requires engagement with abstract concepts such as argument, evidence and perspective. These concepts must be taught explicitly, with concrete examples and scaffolded application.

**Dominant speakers**: Group discussion can be dominated by a small number of confident speakers. Teachers must actively manage participation, using strategies such as think-pair-share, random selection, and structured turn-taking to ensure equitable participation.

## Assessment of Spoken Language

The National Curriculum requires that teachers assess pupils' spoken language capabilities. However, assessment presents particular challenges given the ephemeral nature of talk and the range of contexts in which spoken language occurs.

### Principles of Effective Assessment

**Multiple contexts**: Assessment should sample spoken language across a range of contexts—paired discussion, group work, formal presentation, drama activities—to capture the full range of pupils' capabilities.

**Formative emphasis**: While summative judgements are required, the primary purpose of spoken language assessment should be formative—to identify areas for development and inform teaching.

**Pupil involvement**: Pupils should be involved in assessing their own and others' spoken language. This develops metacognitive awareness and helps pupils internalise quality criteria.

**Authenticity**: Assessment should occur within meaningful learning activities rather than artificial test situations. The focus should be on whether pupils can use spoken language effectively to learn and communicate, not on decontextualised performance.

### Assessment Approaches

**Observation and annotation**: Teachers can observe spoken language activities, annotating specific behaviours that demonstrate particular competencies. Structured observation schedules can help ensure systematic coverage of the curriculum requirements.

**Audio and video recording**: Recording spoken language activities enables more detailed analysis and allows pupils to review and reflect on their own performance.

**Peer and self-assessment**: Pupils can assess their own and peers' spoken language using clear criteria and structured frameworks. This develops evaluative capability whilst providing valuable assessment information.

**Portfolio approaches**: Collecting evidence of spoken language across time and contexts can provide a rich picture of development. This might include transcripts, teacher observations, pupil reflections and recordings.

## Implications for Curriculum Planning

Effective spoken language provision requires careful curriculum planning that ensures comprehensive coverage, clear progression and meaningful integration with other curriculum areas.

### Curriculum Design Principles

**Integration**: Spoken language should be integrated across the curriculum, not confined to English lessons. Every subject provides opportunities for discussion, debate, presentation and collaborative enquiry.

**Progression**: Curriculum planning must ensure clear progression, with increasingly demanding expectations as pupils move through the school. This requires understanding how capabilities develop and what constitutes appropriate challenge at each stage.

**Balance**: The curriculum should balance different types of spoken language activity—informal discussion, formal presentation, collaborative work, performance—ensuring that pupils develop the full range of oracy competencies.

**Rehearsal and performance**: Effective spoken language curricula provide opportunities for both rehearsal (where pupils develop and refine contributions) and performance (where they demonstrate their capabilities to audience).

### Creating a Culture of Oracy

Beyond specific curriculum planning, schools must create a culture that values spoken language. This includes:

- **Modelling**: Teachers and other adults model effective spoken language, demonstrating the value placed on articulate communication.
- **Expectations**: Clear, consistently applied expectations for spoken language in all contexts, from classroom discussion to assemblies to playground interactions.
- **Celebration**: Recognising and celebrating effective spoken language, creating opportunities for pupils to share their voices with wider audiences.
- **Environment**: Physical environments that support different types of spoken language activity, from quiet spaces for paired discussion to spaces for performance and presentation.

## Conclusion

Spoken language represents a foundational element of the English National Curriculum, underpinning development in reading and writing whilst also serving as a crucial competence in its own right. The statutory requirements establish clear expectations for what pupils should know and be able to do, whilst frameworks such as Voice 21's Oracy Framework provide structures for understanding the multidimensional nature of spoken language capability.

Effective spoken language teaching requires explicit attention to the physical, linguistic, cognitive and social-emotional dimensions of oracy. It demands approaches such as dialogic teaching that use talk as a mechanism for learning, and it encompasses a range of activities from informal discussion through drama to formal debate.

As Ofsted's English subject report (2023) noted, the curriculum for spoken language is often less effectively developed than the curriculum for reading. Addressing this gap requires recognising the centrality of spoken language to learning and life, and committing to systematic, high-quality provision that ensures all pupils find their voice and use it effectively.

The evidence is clear: oracy develops pupils' confidence, articulacy and capacity to learn. It supports academic attainment across the curriculum and prepares pupils for participation in democratic society. Spoken language is not an optional extra but an essential entitlement, and effective curriculum planning must ensure that this entitlement is realised for every child.
