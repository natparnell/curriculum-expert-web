# A Level English Language Curriculum Knowledge

## Overview

A Level English Language is a two-year advanced qualification (AQA Specification 7702) that offers systematic study of English language in all its forms: spoken and written, formal and informal, historical and contemporary. It represents a significant shift from GCSE English Language, moving from functional literacy development to academic linguistic study using analytical frameworks and theoretical concepts.

The qualification develops students as:
- Linguists who can analyse language using appropriate terminology and frameworks
- Investigators who can conduct independent language research
- Critical thinkers who can engage with language debates and discourses
- Creative writers who can produce original texts for specific purposes

Unlike English Literature, which focuses on literary texts and aesthetic appreciation, English Language examines how language functions in social contexts, how it varies between users and situations, and how it changes over time.

## Specification and Assessment Structure

### AQA Specification (7702) — Primary Focus

The AQA specification is taken by the vast majority of A Level English Language candidates. It is divided into two examined papers (80% of A Level) and one non-examined assessment (20%).

| **AO3** | Analyse and evaluate how contextual factors affect language use | 20% | Contextual analysis |
| **AO4** | Explore connections across texts, informed by linguistic concepts and methods | 10% | Intertextual connections |
| **AO5** | Demonstrate expertise and creativity in the use of English | 20% | Original writing (NEA) |
| **AO6** | Accurate academic writing, including references and bibliography | 10% | Academic conventions |

## Core Knowledge Areas

### 1. Language Levels and Frameworks

A Level English Language requires systematic analysis using linguistic frameworks:

**Lexis and Semantics:**

## NEA: Language Investigation

The Language Investigation is the centrepiece of the A Level, requiring students to:

  - Occupational language
  - Regional dialect features
  - Social media language patterns

**2. Collect Data:**
- Primary data (recordings, surveys, text collection)
- Ethical considerations (consent, anonymity)
- Data quantity (sufficient for analysis)

**3. Analyse Using Frameworks:**
- Apply language levels
- Use relevant theories
- Quantitative and qualitative analysis

**4. Write Up:**
- Introduction and aims
- Methodology
- Analysis and findings
- Conclusion
- Bibliography and references

**Common pitfalls:**
- Over-ambitious projects
- Insufficient data
- Description without analysis
- Weak methodology
- Plagiarism and citation issues

## NEA: Original Writing

Students produce two pieces of original writing with a reflective commentary.

**Genre Options:**
- Journalism (broadsheet, tabloid, magazine)
- Persuasive writing (speeches, campaigns)
- Creative non-fiction (memoir, travel writing)
- Informational writing (leaflets, guides, websites)
- Creative writing (stories, scripts) — with caution; must demonstrate linguistic craft

**The Reflective Commentary (750 words):**
- Analyses linguistic choices made
- Links to style models studied
- Demonstrates understanding of genre conventions
- Uses terminology appropriately
