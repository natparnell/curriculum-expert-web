# Children's and Young Adult Literature: Text Selection, Diversity and Reading for Pleasure

This knowledge base article explores the principles and practices surrounding text selection for children and young people in UK schools, examining the tension between canonical literature and contemporary voices, the imperative for diverse and inclusive reading lists, and the research underpinning reading for pleasure pedagogies.

## The Principles of Text Selection in School Reading Lists

### Criteria for Quality Children's Literature

The selection of texts for school reading lists requires careful consideration of multiple factors that balance educational value with engagement and accessibility. The DfE Reading Framework (2023) emphasises that teachers and English subject leads should identify a core set of literature for each year group comprising "high-quality contemporary and classic" non-fiction and fiction texts, as well as poetry and prose.

Quality children's literature demonstrates several key characteristics. At the primary level, texts should offer rich language patterns, engaging narratives, and opportunities for emotional connection. The CLPE (Centre for Literacy in Primary Education) emphasises that quality texts use "language that is rich and/or challenging, enabling readers to develop and extend their vocabulary" and "provide experiences that children may not otherwise have access to."

For secondary students, text selection must balance the demands of examination specifications with the development of lifelong reading habits. The National Curriculum requires pupils to read "a wide range of fiction and non-fiction, including in particular whole books, short stories, poems and plays with a wide coverage of genres, historical periods, forms and authors."

### The Role of Book Bands and Reading Schemes

In primary schools, Book Bands provide a structured framework for organising reading materials into colour-coded levels, offering progression from beginner to advanced reading. The system begins at Lilac (for Reception-aged children sharing wordless books) and extends through to Black Plus (for confident Year 6 readers).

Book Bands serve several pedagogical purposes: they enable teachers to match books to children's current reading abilities, provide a clear progression path, and facilitate consistent assessment across classes and year groups. However, practitioners must guard against allowing Book Bands to restrict children's reading choices or limit exposure to rich, challenging texts that fall outside their assigned band.

The UKLA (United Kingdom Literacy Association) advises that while Book Bands support guided reading instruction, they should not constrain children's independent reading for pleasure. Children should have access to texts that interest them, regardless of banding level, particularly when reading with adult support or listening to audio versions.

### Whole-School Text Selection Policies

Effective text selection requires whole-school coherence rather than ad-hoc individual teacher choices. School reading policies should establish clear criteria for text selection that address:

- **Literary quality**: Texts should demonstrate strong craft, rich language, and meaningful thematic content
- **Representation**: Reading lists should reflect the diversity of the school community and wider society
- **Progression**: Texts should build increasing complexity in vocabulary, structure, and conceptual demands across key stages
- **Range**: Pupils should encounter varied genres, forms, periods, and authors
- **Engagement**: Texts should capture children's interest and motivate continued reading

The School Reading List, curated by a panel of over 30 UK primary school teachers and librarians, exemplifies professional curation that balances these considerations. Their lists aim to promote "a love of reading and reading for pleasure" while ensuring "a range of abilities suitable for 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18-year-olds."

## Diversity and Representation in Children's Literature

### The CLPE Reflecting Realities Research

The Centre for Literacy in Primary Education's annual Reflecting Realities survey, launched in 2018, represents the first UK study systematically examining ethnic representation within children's literature. This groundbreaking research has documented significant underrepresentation of racially minoritised characters in children's books published in the UK.

The 2023 Reflecting Realities report found that 17% of children's books published featured racially minoritised characters—an increase from just 4% in the first survey but still failing to reflect the 33.5% of primary school pupils from minority ethnic backgrounds. The 2022 survey had shown improvement to 30%, indicating fluctuation in representation rates.

Beyond simple presence, the CLPE research examines the quality and nature of representation. Their framework identifies what constitutes "high quality, ethnically representative inclusive text," looking for:

- **Presence**: Characters from racially minoritised backgrounds appear in the narrative
- **Agency**: These characters drive the action rather than remaining peripheral
- **Centrality**: Stories where such characters are protagonists, not merely supporting figures
- **Authenticity**: Representation that avoids stereotypes and tokenism
- **Context**: Recognition of cultural specificity without reducing characters to cultural representatives

### The Impact of Limited Representation

When children do not see themselves represented in the books they read, the consequences extend beyond simple exclusion. Research indicates that limited representation can:

- Diminish children's sense of belonging and validation in educational settings
- Perpetuate the perception that certain groups' stories are less worthy of literary attention
- Restrict children's understanding of the diverse society in which they live
- Reinforce unconscious biases and stereotypes

Conversely, diverse and inclusive reading lists provide all children with "windows and mirrors"—opportunities to see their own experiences reflected and to gain insight into lives different from their own. Rudine Sims Bishop's seminal framework distinguishes between:

- **Mirrors**: Books that reflect children's own experiences and validate their identities
- **Windows**: Books that offer views into lives and experiences different from one's own
- **Sliding glass doors**: Books that enable immersive experiences of other perspectives

### Strategies for Diversifying School Reading Lists

Schools seeking to diversify their reading lists should adopt systematic approaches rather than tokenistic additions. Effective strategies include:

**Audit existing stock**: Conduct a thorough review of current reading materials to identify gaps in representation across protected characteristics including ethnicity, disability, socioeconomic background, and LGBTQ+ identities.

**Engage professional guidance**: Resources such as the CLPE Reflecting Realities reports, the School Library Association's diversity guidance, and the National Literacy Trust's inclusive reading lists provide curated recommendations.

**Centre #OwnVoices**: Prioritise texts where authors share the marginalised identities of their characters, ensuring authentic representation rather than outsider perspectives.

**Interrogate quality**: Ensure that diverse texts meet the same literary quality standards as other curriculum materials. Diversity should enhance rather than compromise literary selection.

**Consider intersectionality**: Recognise that children hold multiple identities simultaneously. Texts should represent diverse characters in varied roles and contexts, avoiding the reduction of characters to single identity markers.

**Engage the community**: Involve pupils, families, and community members in text selection processes to ensure reading lists reflect and respect the school community's composition.

## Reading for Pleasure: Research and Pedagogy

### The DfE Reading Framework

The Department for Education's Reading Framework, updated in July 2023, places reading for pleasure at the centre of quality literacy education. The framework recognises that "motivation to develop a love of reading" is fundamental to reading success, emphasising that "reading engagement" and "reading for pleasure" should be integral parts of a quality book-based English curriculum.

The framework makes clear that schools should meet expectations across the Early Years Foundation Stage statutory framework, the national curriculum, and Ofsted's inspection framework, with quality children's literature at the heart of the reading curriculum. Teachers are encouraged to ensure that story time, independent reading, and reading for pleasure are protected and prioritised within the school day.

Key recommendations include:

- Establishing dedicated story time across all primary year groups
- Ensuring access to well-stocked, appealing libraries or reading spaces
- Protecting time for independent reading
- Developing teachers' knowledge of children's literature
- Creating whole-school reading cultures where books are valued and discussed

### The Open University Reading for Pleasure Research

Professor Teresa Cremin and the Open University Reading for Pleasure team have conducted extensive research into the conditions that foster engaged reading communities. Their work demonstrates that reading for pleasure is not merely an enjoyable addition to the curriculum but a pedagogical imperative with measurable impacts on literacy outcomes.

Cremin's research identifies several key factors in developing reading for pleasure:

**Teachers as readers**: Teachers who read children's and young adult literature themselves are better positioned to recommend texts, engage in book talk, and model enthusiastic reading. The Teachers as Readers (TaRs) research found that when teachers developed their own reading for pleasure, their pedagogical practices shifted to prioritise independent reading and voluntary book choice.

**Social reading environments**: Reading for pleasure thrives in social contexts where books are discussed, shared, and celebrated. Classrooms and schools that function as "reading communities" demonstrate higher levels of reading engagement.

**Voluntary choice**: Intrinsic motivation—the desire to read driven by curiosity, enjoyment, and personal meaning—leads to stronger engagement than extrinsic rewards or compulsory reading. The National Literacy Trust emphasises that "reading driven by curiosity, enjoyment and personal meaning leads to stronger engagement and more positive reading behaviours."

**Access and entitlement**: All children must have access to appealing, diverse reading materials. The National Literacy Trust's Libraries for Primaries campaign aims to ensure every primary school has a dedicated library or reading space by 2028.

### Pedagogical Approaches to Reading for Pleasure

Translating research into practice requires deliberate pedagogical strategies:

**Read-aloud and story time**: Daily read-aloud sessions expose children to texts beyond their independent reading level, model fluent reading, and create shared literary experiences. The DfE Reading Framework recommends identifying core texts for each year group to be read aloud.

**Independent reading time**: Protected time for children to read self-selected texts supports the development of reading habits and allows children to exercise choice. This should be distinct from guided reading instruction.

**Book talk**: Regular opportunities for informal discussion about books—recommendations, responses, connections—build reading communities and help children discover new texts.

**Reading environments**: Physical spaces that celebrate books, display recommendations, and provide comfortable reading areas signal the value placed on reading.

**Reading role models**: When teachers, support staff, senior leaders, and visitors share their own reading lives, they demonstrate that reading is valued by adults as well as expected of children.

## The Canon Versus Contemporary Debate

### Understanding the Literary Canon

The literary canon refers to those texts considered worthy of study by virtue of their perceived artistic merit, cultural significance, and enduring value. In English literature education, the canon has traditionally been dominated by white, male authors from Britain and America, with Shakespeare occupying a uniquely central position.

The National Curriculum specifies that pupils should read "works of literature that are widely regarded as classics" alongside contemporary texts. At GCSE, examination specifications require study of:

- At least one Shakespeare play
- At least one nineteenth-century novel
- A selection of poetry since 1789 (including Romantic poetry)
- Fiction or drama from the British Isles from 1914 onwards

These requirements reflect a curriculum conception of literary value rooted in historical significance and canonical status. The Education Inspection Framework references "cultural capital"—the knowledge that enables pupils to engage with and participate in educated discourse.

### Critiques of Canonical Dominance

Critics argue that excessive focus on the traditional canon produces several problematic outcomes:

**Narrow representation**: The traditional canon largely excludes women writers, authors of colour, working-class voices, and postcolonial perspectives. When pupils encounter only canonical texts, they receive a distorted picture of literary history and human experience.

**Cultural irrelevance**: Pupils may struggle to connect with texts rooted in historical contexts far removed from their own experiences. The language, concerns, and cultural references of canonical texts can present unnecessary barriers.

**Disengagement**: When pupils do not see themselves or their communities reflected in curriculum texts, they may conclude that literature is not "for them"—a perception that undermines reading for pleasure and literary engagement.

**Political assumptions**: The canon is not neutral; it reflects historical power structures and value judgments about whose voices merit preservation and study. Treating canonical status as self-evident rather than constructed obscures these political dimensions.

### Contemporary and Diverse Voices

Recognition of these limitations has prompted examination boards and schools to expand text selections beyond traditional canonical boundaries. Both AQA and Pearson Edexcel have introduced more diverse texts to their GCSE English Literature specifications in response to calls for greater representation.

Pearson Edexcel announced additions of "two new novels, two new plays and a new poetry collection" to address "the lack of diversity of British texts at KS4." AQA similarly introduced new diverse texts from September 2023, allowing pupils "more access to a range of writers."

Contemporary children's and young adult literature offers several pedagogical advantages:

- **Accessibility**: Modern texts typically employ language and address concerns more immediately recognisable to young readers
- **Diversity**: Contemporary publishing demonstrates greater attention to representing diverse experiences and perspectives
- **Engagement**: Pupils often find contemporary texts more immediately compelling, supporting reading for pleasure
- **Relevance**: Contemporary texts can address current social issues and enable meaningful connection to pupils' lived experiences

However, exclusive focus on contemporary texts would also represent a limitation. Understanding literary history, encountering sophisticated prose and poetry, and engaging with enduring human questions across time periods remain valuable educational experiences.

### Developing Balanced Reading Lists

Rather than framing the question as canon versus contemporary, effective text selection seeks balance and complementarity:

**Thematic pairing**: Connecting canonical and contemporary texts through shared themes enables pupils to trace continuities and changes across literary history. For example, studying Shakespeare's treatment of power alongside contemporary political fiction.

**Counter-canonical voices**: Including texts that respond to, challenge, or reimagine canonical works provides critical perspective on literary tradition. Postcolonial rewritings of colonial narratives, feminist responses to patriarchal classics, or contemporary adaptations of canonical texts enable this dialogue.

**Expanding definitions of classic**: Recognising that "classic" need not mean "old" enables inclusion of contemporary works that demonstrate lasting significance. The canon is not fixed; it evolves as new works demonstrate enduring value.

**Pupil voice**: Involving students in text selection processes ensures reading lists reflect their interests and respond to their feedback about what engages them.

## Text Selection Across Key Stages

### Early Years and Key Stage 1

In the Early Years Foundation Stage, literature plays a central role in developing language, imagination, and early reading behaviours. The statutory framework requires that children experience "a wide range of songs, rhymes, poems, and stories."

Text selection priorities at this stage include:

- **Predictable and patterned language**: Texts with repetition, rhyme, and predictable structures support early reading development and build confidence
- **Rich vocabulary**: Even simple texts should expose children to sophisticated language in meaningful contexts
- **Visual support**: Illustrations that extend and complement the text enable comprehension and engagement
- **Read-aloud quality**: Texts should reward repeated readings and provide opportunities for expressive performance
- **Cultural diversity**: Early exposure to diverse characters and experiences builds inclusive understandings from the outset

Key Stage 1 builds on these foundations, with increasing attention to phonically decodable texts alongside rich read-aloud experiences. The CLPE Power of Reading programme emphasises the importance of quality picture books across the primary age range, not merely for younger children.

### Key Stage 2

During Key Stage 2, pupils should encounter progressively challenging texts that prepare them for secondary English while maintaining engagement and pleasure in reading. The National Curriculum requires pupils to read "a wide range of books" and develop "positive attitudes to reading."

Text selection considerations include:

- **Increasing text complexity**: Chapter books with sustained narratives, multiple viewpoints, and sophisticated vocabulary
- **Genre range**: Exposure to fantasy, historical fiction, mystery, biography, and non-fiction genres
- **Thematic depth**: Texts addressing friendship, identity, challenge, and change
- **Classic and contemporary balance**: Introduction to adapted classics alongside modern children's literature
- **Poetry and non-fiction**: Sustained attention to forms beyond narrative fiction

Research by Cremin and colleagues indicates that primary pupils benefit enormously from access to "children's literature that touches the imagination and expands the mind" rather than being restricted to scheme books or excessively simplified texts.

### Key Stage 3

The transition to secondary school represents a critical moment for reading identity. Pupils who arrive as engaged readers may disengage if secondary reading lists fail to capture their interest. Conversely, pupils who have struggled with reading may find renewed motivation through carefully selected, age-appropriate texts.

The DfE Research Review for English (2022) notes that "the key stage 2 curriculum should prepare pupils for key stage 3, at which point texts will include prose, poetry and drama, Shakespeare plays and seminal world literature, both contemporary and pre-1914."

KS3 text selection should:

- **Bridge primary and secondary**: Texts that feel appropriately mature while remaining accessible to less confident readers
- **Introduce canonical literature**: Begin exposure to Shakespeare, nineteenth-century literature, and classic poetry in forms that engage young readers (adapted texts, graphic novel versions, performance-based approaches)
- **Embrace young adult literature**: Quality YA fiction addresses adolescent concerns with literary sophistication
- **Support reading for pleasure**: Independent reading schemes, reading challenges, and wide choice in reading materials maintain engagement alongside set text study

### Key Stage 4 and GCSE

GCSE English Literature specifications determine much of KS4 text selection, but schools retain significant autonomy in approach and supplementary reading.

Current GCSE specifications require study of:

- Shakespeare (Macbeth dominates at 76% of AQA candidates)
- Nineteenth-century novel
- Modern prose or drama
- Poetry anthology plus unseen poetry

The dominance of particular texts—particularly Macbeth for Shakespeare and specific nineteenth-century novels—has prompted concern about limited text variety across the cohort. However, the introduction of more diverse texts by examination boards reflects gradual expansion of options.

Beyond set texts, KS4 should maintain attention to reading for pleasure. The pressure of examination preparation can squeeze out independent reading, yet engaged readers demonstrate stronger comprehension and analytical skills. Schools should protect reading for pleasure even during examination years.

## Practical Implementation: Building Quality Reading Lists

### Conducting a Reading Audit

Schools seeking to improve their reading provision should begin with comprehensive audit:

1. **Stock audit**: Catalogue existing books by genre, author diversity, difficulty level, and condition
2. **Curriculum mapping**: Document which texts are studied at each year group and identify gaps or repetitions
3. **Engagement survey**: Gather pupil feedback on current reading provision, favourite texts, and barriers to reading
4. **Staff knowledge assessment**: Survey teachers' familiarity with children's and young adult literature
5. **Community consultation**: Engage parents, carers, and community members in understanding reading priorities

### Developing a Text Selection Policy

A robust text selection policy provides clear guidance while allowing professional flexibility. Key elements include:

**Selection criteria**: Articulated standards for literary quality, appropriateness, and representation
**Review cycle**: Regular scheduled review of reading lists to ensure continued relevance and quality
**Decision-making processes**: Clear roles and responsibilities for text selection, including pupil and community input
**Challenge procedures**: Transparent processes for addressing concerns about specific texts
**Budget allocation**: Transparent processes for acquiring new texts and maintaining collections

### Building Teacher Knowledge

Teachers' knowledge of children's literature directly impacts their capacity to recommend texts, guide selection, and foster reading communities. Professional development strategies include:

**Teachers as Readers groups**: Regular meetings where teachers discuss children's and young adult books
**Publisher engagement**: Attending book fairs, publisher presentations, and author events
**Professional reading**: Engaging with journals, blogs, and resources such as Books for Keeps, School Librarian, and CLPE publications
**Peer observation**: Visiting classrooms with strong reading cultures to observe practice
**Collaboration with librarians**: Working with school and public librarians who maintain current knowledge of publishing

### Creating Reading Communities

Text selection occurs within wider reading cultures. Schools should build environments where:

- Books are visibly valued and celebrated throughout the school
- Reading is understood as a social activity involving recommendation, discussion, and sharing
- Pupils have regular opportunities to exercise choice in their reading
- Adults model enthusiastic engagement with literature
- Diverse reading materials are readily accessible in all classrooms and shared spaces

## Conclusion: Literature as Transformation

Children's and young adult literature carries profound educational significance. The texts we select communicate what we value, whose stories we consider worth telling, and what we believe our pupils deserve to encounter. Thoughtful text selection balances tradition with innovation, canon with diversity, and educational purpose with the fundamental human need for stories that move, challenge, and transform.

The research is unequivocal: pupils who read for pleasure demonstrate stronger academic outcomes, enhanced empathy, and greater wellbeing. Yet reading for pleasure cannot flourish where texts feel irrelevant, unrepresentative, or inaccessible. Schools that attend carefully to text selection—ensuring diversity of voice, quality of craft, and responsiveness to their communities—create conditions where literature becomes a source of joy, understanding, and empowerment for all pupils.

The ongoing work of curriculum review, diversification of publishing, and professional learning continues to expand possibilities for English teachers. As the CLPE Reflecting Realities research demonstrates, representation in children's literature is improving but remains inadequate. As examination boards diversify set texts and publishers expand their lists, schools must seize these opportunities to build reading lists that honour the full complexity of human experience and prepare pupils to participate in an interconnected world.

Ultimately, the goal is not merely to teach texts but to nurture readers—pupils who will continue seeking out literature long after their formal schooling ends. This requires us to select texts worthy of their attention, representative of their world, and capable of opening doors to lives beyond their immediate experience. In doing so, we fulfil literature's transformative promise.
