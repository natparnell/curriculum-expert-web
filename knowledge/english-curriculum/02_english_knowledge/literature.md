# Literature: Literary Heritage, Canon, and Critical Reading

## Overview

The study of literature forms a central pillar of English education in UK schools, encompassing engagement with the **literary heritage**—those texts that have shaped English literary culture over centuries—alongside contemporary works that reflect diverse voices and experiences. The National Curriculum for English (2014) establishes that pupils should "read a wide range of fiction and non-fiction, including in particular whole books, short stories, poems and plays with a wide coverage of genres, historical periods, forms and authors."

This knowledge base addresses the statutory requirements, pedagogical approaches, and critical frameworks necessary for teaching literature effectively across all key stages, with particular attention to the demands of GCSE English Literature specifications.

## The Literary Canon and Literary Heritage

### Defining the Canon

The **literary canon** refers to those works considered to be of high cultural value and worthy of sustained academic study. Traditionally, this has comprised texts by predominantly white, male, British authors—Shakespeare, Dickens, Austen, the Romantic poets. The 2014 National Curriculum explicitly requires pupils to study "works of high quality by established authors," effectively mandating engagement with canonical texts.

However, the concept of a fixed canon has been subject to significant critique. As the University of Liverpool's Department of English (2021) notes, colonialism led to the "marginalisation of authors from different cultures leading to a canon of predominantly white Western authors." This has prompted ongoing efforts to **decolonise the curriculum** and expand what constitutes literary value.

### GCSE Requirements for Literary Heritage

The DfE's GCSE subject content (2013) mandates that students study:

- At least one play by **Shakespeare**
- At least one **19th-century novel**
- A selection of **poetry since 1789**, including representative Romantic poetry
- **British fiction or drama from 1914 onwards**

These requirements ensure all pupils encounter foundational texts of English literary culture. AQA's specification (8702), for instance, requires students to study four set texts covering these categories, with assessment through closed-book examinations that test detailed knowledge and textual analysis.

### Balancing Heritage and Diversity

Contemporary English teaching navigates a tension between:

1. **Preserving literary heritage** — ensuring pupils encounter the foundational texts that have shaped English culture and language
2. **Expanding representation** — including voices from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives

The RSC and Globe Theatre, alongside organisations like NATE (National Association for the Teaching of English), advocate for approaches that honour canonical texts whilst interrogating whose voices are centred and whose are marginalised.

## Poetry Across the Key Stages

### Early Years and Key Stage 1 (Ages 3-7)

The EYFS framework and Key Stage 1 programmes of study establish foundations for poetry appreciation through:

- **Nursery rhymes and traditional verse** — developing phonological awareness and enjoyment of rhythm and rhyme
- **Listening to and learning by heart** — building oral repertoire and memory
- **Playing with language** — exploring sound patterns, alliteration, and wordplay

The National Curriculum requires that by the end of Key Stage 1, pupils should have "listened to and discussed a wide range of poems" and "learned to appreciate rhymes and poems, and to recite some by heart."

### Key Stage 2 (Ages 7-11)

Poetry teaching in Key Stage 2 develops more sophisticated engagement:

**Statutory requirements include:**
- Reading and discussing a wide range of poetry
- Identifying how language, structure, and presentation contribute to meaning
- Preparing poems to read aloud, showing understanding through intonation, tone, and volume
- Recognising different forms of poetry (e.g., free verse, narrative poetry)

Primary teachers often use frameworks like **Poetry by Heart** or the **CLPE (Centre for Literacy in Primary Education)** Power of Poetry programme to structure progression.

### Key Stage 3 (Ages 11-14)

At Key Stage 3, pupils encounter:

- A broader historical range of poetry, including pre-20th-century verse
- More complex forms and structures (sonnets, ballads, blank verse)
- Introduction to studying poems in thematic clusters or historical contexts
- Development of critical vocabulary for discussing poetic technique

### Key Stage 4: GCSE Poetry Anthologies

GCSE English Literature specifications require students to study **anthologised poetry**, typically organised into themed clusters:

**AQA Poetry Anthology structure:**
- **Love and Relationships** (15 poems spanning 18th century to contemporary)
- **Power and Conflict** (15 poems addressing themes of power, authority, and conflict)
- **Time and Place** (nature, environment, and location-themed poetry)

Each cluster includes representative Romantic poetry alongside 20th and 21st-century poets. Students must be prepared to analyse poems in detail, compare thematically, and respond to an **unseen poem**.

---

## Prose Fiction and Non-Fiction

### Prose Fiction: Novels and Short Stories

The National Curriculum requires pupils to "read whole books" across all key stages.

**Key Stage 4 (GCSE):**
Students study **two prose texts**: one 19th-century novel and one post-1914 text.

**Common 19th-century novel choices:**
- Charles Dickens (*A Christmas Carol*, *Great Expectations*)
- Charlotte Brontë (*Jane Eyre*)
- Mary Shelley (*Frankenstein*)
- Robert Louis Stevenson (*The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde*)

**Common post-1914 choices:**
- William Golding (*Lord of the Flies*)
- George Orwell (*Animal Farm*)
- Kazuo Ishiguro (*Never Let Me Go*)

**Teaching approaches for 19th-century prose:**
- Addressing linguistic complexity through scaffolded reading
- Building contextual knowledge (Victorian society, industrialisation, Empire)
- Developing close reading skills for analysing descriptive and symbolic passages

### Non-Fiction Prose

Non-fiction prose is integral to English Language GCSE and cross-curricular literacy. The National Curriculum emphasises that pupils should read "non-fiction to develop their knowledge and understanding of the world."

---

## Drama Texts

### Shakespeare: The Cornerstone

Shakespeare study is mandatory at Key Stage 3 and GCSE. This represents the most sustained engagement with any single author in the English curriculum.

**GCSE Shakespeare study:**
Students study one play in depth from examination board specifications:

**AQA set texts:**
- *Romeo and Juliet*
- *Macbeth*
- *The Tempest*
- *The Merchant of Venice*
- *Much Ado About Nothing*
- *Julius Caesar*

**Effective pedagogical strategies (RSC/Globe approaches):**

1. **Performance-based learning** — getting pupils on their feet to speak the lines
2. **Rehearsal room pedagogy** — treating the classroom as a rehearsal space
3. **Language exploration** — close attention to imagery and rhetorical structures
4. **Contextual understanding** — linking plays to their historical moment
5. **Critical perspectives** — introducing feminist, post-colonial, and Marxist readings

### Modern Drama

Popular modern drama choices include:

- J.B. Priestley (*An Inspector Calls*)
- Willy Russell (*Blood Brothers*)
- Alan Bennett (*The History Boys*)
- Shelagh Delaney (*A Taste of Honey*)

## Critical and Analytical Reading

### Developing Critical Readers

The progression from reading for pleasure to **critical reading**—engaging with texts analytically, questioning their assumptions, and evaluating their effects—is central to English education.

### Analytical Frameworks

Effective literary analysis draws on several interconnected frameworks:

**1. Formal analysis:**
- Language choices (vocabulary, imagery, figurative language)
- Structural features (sentence construction, paragraphing, narrative structure)
- Poetic/dramatic form

**2. Contextual analysis:**
- Historical and social contexts of production
- Literary traditions and intertextuality

**3. Interpretive analysis:**
- Reader response and reception theory
- Multiple valid readings and the evidence supporting them

### Critical Theory for Schools

GCSE and Key Stage 3 teaching can introduce foundational concepts:

- **Feminist criticism** — examining gender roles and patriarchal structures
- **Marxist criticism** — analysing class, power, economic structures
- **Post-colonial criticism** — interrogating Empire and cultural dominance
- **Eco-criticism** — exploring nature and environment

## Common Pupil Misconceptions in Literature Study

### Understanding Genre and Form

**Misconception:** Poetry is always about emotions; prose tells stories; plays are just dialogue.

**Correction:** Genre boundaries are fluid. Poetry can narrate; prose can be lyrical; plays contain extensive stage directions shaping meaning.

### Interpreting Shakespeare's Language

**Misconception:** Shakespeare's language is simply "old English" and irrelevant today.

**Correction:** Shakespeare coined phrases still in use; his plays address universal themes.

### Identifying Poetic Techniques

**Misconception:** Listing technical features constitutes analysis.

**Correction:** Technique identification is a starting point. True analysis explains **how** techniques create meaning and **why** the writer made those choices.

## Genre-Specific Pedagogies

### Teaching the Novel

The novel presents particular pedagogical challenges due to its length and complexity. Effective novel teaching requires:

**Pre-reading strategies:**
- Building contextual knowledge before encountering the text
- Establishing reading schedules that balance pace with comprehension
- Using extracts to model analytical approaches

**During-reading support:**
- Chapter summaries to support struggling readers
- Character tracking and relationship mapping
- Thematic questioning that guides attention without closing interpretation

**Post-reading consolidation:**
- Synthesis activities connecting themes across the whole text
- Critical essay preparation focusing on conceptualised arguments
- Comparison with other texts (where relevant)

### Teaching Poetry

Poetry often generates anxiety in pupils and teachers alike. Effective poetry pedagogy:

**Makes the familiar strange and the strange familiar:**
- Starting with accessible poems before moving to more complex texts
- Using contemporary spoken word and hip-hop as bridges to canonical verse
- Encouraging personal response before technical analysis

**Develops poetic vocabulary progressively:**
- Key Stage 1-2: rhyme, rhythm, repetition, alliteration
- Key Stage 3: metaphor, simile, personification, imagery
- Key Stage 4: enjambment, caesura, volta, semantic fields, structural patterns

**Values performance and embodiment:**
- Poetry reading competitions and recitation
- Exploring how delivery affects meaning
- Using music and art to illuminate poetic effects

### Teaching Drama

Drama is the most obviously performative literary form, yet classroom pedagogy often reduces it to printed text.

**Active approaches:**
- **Hot-seating:** interrogating characters in role
- **Thought-tracking:** articulating subtext and interiority
- **Forum theatre:** exploring alternative choices and outcomes
- **Tableaux:** crystallising key moments as still images

**Textual approaches:**
- Close reading of stage directions and their theatrical implications
- Analysis of dramatic structure (exposition, rising action, climax, resolution)
- Exploration of how dialogue constructs character and advances plot

## The Role of Literary Theory in School English

While A-level and university English engage explicitly with literary theory, Key Stage 3 and GCSE can introduce theoretical concepts implicitly:

### Feminist Readings

Pupils can be encouraged to ask:
- Whose perspective dominates this text?
- How are female characters positioned—active or passive?
- What does the text suggest about gender roles and expectations?
- How might the text be read "against the grain"?

### Marxist Readings

Key questions include:
- What class positions do characters occupy?
- How does the text represent wealth, poverty, and social mobility?
- Whose interests does the text seem to serve?
- What ideological messages about power and economics are conveyed?

### Post-colonial Readings

Particularly relevant when teaching texts from or about the British Empire:
- How are colonised peoples represented?
- What assumptions about cultural superiority operate?
- Whose voice is centred and whose is marginalised?
- How does the text engage with issues of race, identity, and belonging?

These approaches develop pupils' critical consciousness and capacity for multiple readings, preparing them for the interpretive demands of advanced study.

---

## Differentiation in Literature Teaching

### Supporting Struggling Readers

- **Adapted texts:** using abridged versions or graphic novel adaptations as scaffolds
- **Audiobooks:** supporting comprehension through listening
- **Drama activities:** embodying texts to support understanding
- **Vocabulary pre-teaching:** building lexical knowledge before encountering texts
- **Chunking:** breaking complex texts into manageable sections with frequent comprehension checks

### Stretching More Able Pupils

- **Independent wider reading:** reading beyond set texts thematically or historically
- **Critical engagement:** introducing scholarly articles and critical perspectives
- **Comparative analysis:** exploring intertextual connections
- **Creative-critical writing:** producing original work that demonstrates understanding of form and convention
- **Theory introduction:** engaging with foundational critical concepts

---

## Digital Technologies in Literature Teaching

### Film and Adaptation

Film adaptations can support literature teaching when used judiciously:

**Effective uses:**
- Building comprehension of complex plots
- Visualising historical settings
- Comparing interpretations (how does this director's Hamlet differ from that one?)
- Analysing how medium affects meaning (what can film do that prose cannot?)

**Cautions:**
- Ensuring film does not replace textual study
- Recognising that adaptation involves interpretation and change
- Supporting pupils to analyse rather than simply consume adaptations

### Digital Texts and E-readers

- **Built-in dictionaries:** supporting vocabulary development
- **Annotation tools:** facilitating close reading practices
- **Accessibility features:** text-to-speech, adjustable fonts, colour overlays
- **Hyperlinked editions:** connecting to contextual resources

### Online Resources

- **Virtual theatre:** accessing performances from the RSC, Globe, and National Theatre
- **Author websites:** exploring writers' own perspectives on their work
- **Academic databases:** introducing pupils to scholarly approaches (at A-level)
- **Collaborative platforms:** enabling shared annotation and discussion

---

## Assessment for Learning in Literature

### Diagnostic Assessment

Understanding what pupils bring to texts:
- Prior knowledge of historical contexts
- Existing vocabulary and conceptual frameworks
- Reading habits and preferences
- Previous experience of literary study

### Formative Assessment

Ongoing monitoring of developing understanding:
- **Quotation exploration:** What does this quotation suggest about character/theme?
- **Predictive questions:** What do you think happens next? Why?
- **Comparative prompts:** How does this scene contrast with the earlier one?
- **Exit tickets:** One thing you've learned, one question you have

### Summative Assessment

Evaluating achievement against standards:
- **Essay writing:** sustained analytical argument with textual evidence
- **Unseen analysis:** application of skills to unfamiliar texts
- **Comparative tasks:** exploring connections between texts
- **Critical evaluation:** engaging with interpretations and alternative readings

---
