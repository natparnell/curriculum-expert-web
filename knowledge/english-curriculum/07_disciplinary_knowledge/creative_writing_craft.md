## Introduction: The Place of Creative Writing in the English Curriculum

The National Curriculum for English (2014) establishes creative writing as a core component of pupils' literary development. From the Early Years Foundation Stage through to Key Stage 4, pupils are expected to develop competence in composing stories, poetry, and other imaginative forms. The programmes of study explicitly require pupils to write for "a wide range of purposes and audiences, including: well-structured formal expository and narrative essays; stories, scripts, poetry and other imaginative writing."

Creative writing serves multiple educational purposes. It develops linguistic competence, fosters cognitive growth through imaginative engagement, builds emotional literacy, and provides opportunities for personal expression. Research consistently demonstrates that explicit teaching of writing craft—rather than mere opportunity to write—produces stronger outcomes. The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) identifies process writing approaches, including structured drafting and revision, as having significant positive impact on pupil attainment.

This document examines three interconnected domains of creative writing craft: narrative techniques for fiction writing, poetic forms and devices, and the writing process from drafting through to publication-ready editing.

## Narrative Techniques

### Understanding Narrative Architecture

Effective narrative writing requires understanding how stories function. At its most fundamental, narrative consists of a sequence of events (plot) experienced by characters, conveyed through a particular perspective (narration), and situated within a specific context (setting). The National Curriculum requires pupils to demonstrate increasing sophistication in handling these elements as they progress through the key stages.

In Key Stage 1, pupils begin by composing simple sequenced narratives, often drawing on oral storytelling traditions. By Key Stage 2, they are expected to manage more complex narrative structures, including flashbacks, multiple viewpoints, and sustained atmospheric writing. At Key Stage 3 and GCSE, pupils must demonstrate conscious control over narrative voice, pacing, and structural decisions.

### Show, Don't Tell: The Foundation of Vivid Writing

The principle of "show, don't tell" represents the cornerstone of effective descriptive and narrative writing. Rather than informing readers directly about characters' feelings or situations, skilled writers imply these through concrete detail, action, and dialogue. This technique engages readers' inferential capacities, making reading an active, participatory experience.

The AQA GCSE English Language specification explicitly rewards writing that demonstrates rather than merely reports. From 2026, the focus for Paper 1 Question 5 has shifted to crafting just the opening section of a narrative rather than completing an entire story. This change allows candidates to spend more time building atmosphere, introducing character through revealing detail, and creating intrigue through carefully selected imagery.

Sensory detail forms the practical mechanism for showing. Writers appeal to sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell to construct immersive fictional worlds. Research into expert writing instruction emphasises the importance of building pupils' capacity to notice and record sensory particulars.

### Characterisation Techniques

Believable, engaging characters form the heart of effective narrative writing. The National Curriculum requires pupils to create characters who are more than mere functional types, instead demonstrating psychological complexity appropriate to their developmental stage.

**Direct characterisation** involves explicit description of a character's appearance, personality, or background. **Indirect characterisation** reveals character through speech, action, thought, and the reactions of others. This approach aligns with the "show, don't tell" principle and generally produces more compelling fictional people.

Dialogue serves multiple functions in characterisation. It reveals social background through dialect and register, demonstrates personality through what characters choose to discuss and how they discuss it, and advances plot through the information exchanged. Teaching pupils to write dialogue that sounds natural while avoiding the aimlessness of real speech represents a significant instructional challenge.

### Pacing and Narrative Structure

Controlling narrative pace distinguishes competent writers from exceptional ones. Pacing involves managing the relationship between story time (how long events take in the fictional world) and discourse time (how many words are devoted to recounting them). Moments of high tension or significance typically expand in discourse time, while routine transitions compress.

The National Curriculum's increasing emphasis on structure across key stages reflects recognition that form carries meaning. Common structural techniques include:

- **In medias res:** Beginning in the middle of action, then using flashback to supply context
- **Framed narrative:** A story within a story, with an outer narrative providing context for the inner tale
- **Non-linear chronology:** Presenting events out of sequence for dramatic or thematic effect
- **Circular structure:** Ending where the narrative began, often with transformed significance

### Atmosphere and Setting

Setting in narrative writing functions as more than mere backdrop. It establishes mood, influences character behaviour, and frequently carries symbolic weight. The English programmes of study require pupils to demonstrate increasing sophistication in establishing and sustaining atmosphere.

Creating atmosphere involves careful selection of sensory detail, controlled sentence length and rhythm, and strategic use of figurative language. Pathetic fallacy—attributing emotional qualities to natural phenomena—remains a legitimate technique when deployed with restraint and awareness.

## Poetry Forms and Craft

### The Significance of Poetry in the Curriculum

Poetry occupies a distinctive place in English literary culture and education. The National Curriculum requires pupils to read, recite, and compose poetry throughout their school careers. Despite this emphasis, Ofsted's Curriculum Research Review: English (2022) identified a concerning absence: the review contained no discussion of research on poetry pedagogy, despite substantial scholarship in this area.

The English Association and English and Media Centre both challenged this omission, noting that poetry offers unique opportunities for developing precision in language use, exploring emotional complexity, and engaging with concentrated forms of meaning-making.

### Foundational Poetry Forms

The primary and secondary curriculum introduces pupils to a range of poetic forms, each with distinct characteristics and pedagogical affordances.

**Haiku and Senryu:** These Japanese forms offer accessible entry points for young writers. The 5-7-5 syllable structure provides manageable constraint, while the form's emphasis on natural imagery and seasonal reference supports observation skills.

**Limerick:** The five-line anapestic form with its distinctive AABBA rhyme scheme offers opportunities for humorous composition. The predictable structure makes it suitable for exploring rhyme and rhythm without the complexity of longer forms.

**Ballad:** The traditional narrative form, typically with alternating four- and three-stress lines and ABCB rhyme scheme, connects poetry to storytelling. Ballads' historical association with oral tradition makes them particularly suitable for performance and memorisation.

**Sonnet:** The fourteen-line form, whether Shakespearean (ABAB CDCD EFEF GG) or Petrarchan (ABBAABBA CDECDE or CDCDCD), represents the pinnacle of formal poetry in English. Sonnets' strict constraints—meter, rhyme, the volta or turn—demand precision and reward craft.

**Free Verse:** The absence of regular metre or rhyme scheme does not mean absence of craft. Free verse requires attention to line breaks, rhythm, and the visual appearance of the poem on the page. Contemporary poetry has largely abandoned strict formal requirements, making free verse the dominant mode.

### Poetic Devices and Techniques

Beyond form, poetry relies on specific linguistic techniques that compress meaning and create effects through sound and pattern.

**Imagery:** The concrete representation of sensory experience forms the foundation of poetic craft. Effective imagery is specific rather than generic, surprising rather than predictable.

**Metaphor and Simile:** Figurative comparison creates meaning through juxtaposition. While similes make explicit comparisons using "like" or "as," metaphors operate more directly, asserting identity between unlike things.

**Alliteration, Assonance, and Consonance:** Patterning of sound creates musical effects and can emphasise meaning. Alliteration creates strong rhythmic emphasis. Assonance creates subtler connections. Consonance binds phrases together.

**Rhythm and Meter:** The patterning of stressed and unstressed syllables creates the musical foundation of much poetry. While contemporary poetry has moved away from strict metrical requirements, understanding metre develops sensitivity to rhythmic effects in all writing.

### Teaching Poetry Writing

The Centre for Literacy in Primary Education (CLPE) and National Association for the Teaching of English (NATE) both emphasise that effective poetry teaching combines immersion in published poetry with structured opportunities for composition. Pupils need to hear, read, and internalise poems before attempting to write their own.

Effective approaches include imitation, collaborative composition, response to stimuli, and focused revision on lexical precision.

## The Writing Process: Drafting and Editing

### From Product to Process

The shift from viewing writing as product to understanding it as process represents one of the most significant developments in writing pedagogy. The Education Endowment Foundation's guidance identifies process approaches—explicitly teaching planning, drafting, sharing, evaluating, revising, editing, and publishing—as having strong evidence of effectiveness.

The National Curriculum embeds process approaches throughout its programmes of study. The Key Stage 3 English programme explicitly requires pupils to develop "drafting skills and developing resilience to write at length."

### The Stages of the Writing Process

Research from the EEF and the Centre for Literacy in Primary Education identifies seven stages in the writing process:

**Planning:** Before any drafting begins, writers need to consider purpose, audience, content, and structure.

**Drafting:** The initial composition stage should prioritise generating content over correctness. Writers need permission to write imperfectly in first drafts.

**Sharing:** Reading work aloud to others or exchanging drafts with peers provides crucial feedback and builds audience awareness.

**Evaluating:** Both self-evaluation and teacher evaluation inform subsequent revision, focusing on higher-order concerns before lower-order concerns.

**Revising:** Revision involves making substantial changes to content and structure, addressing what the writing says and how it is organised.

**Editing:** Once content is established, writers focus on accuracy—spelling, punctuation, grammar, and word-level choices.

**Publishing:** The final stage presents writing to its intended audience, providing authentic purpose for writing.

### Differentiating Revising and Editing

A persistent challenge in teaching writing is helping pupils understand the distinction between revising (making changes to content and structure) and editing (making changes to ensure accuracy). Many pupils conflate these stages or attempt to edit before substantial revision is complete.

**Revising** asks questions about the writing as a whole: Does this achieve its purpose? Is the structure effective? Are characters believable? Is the pacing appropriate?

**Editing** asks questions about accuracy: Are sentences punctuated correctly? Is spelling accurate? Are grammatical structures correct?

### Building Writing Resilience

The National Curriculum's reference to developing resilience recognises that extended writing is cognitively demanding and emotionally challenging. Building resilience involves normalising struggle, modelling process, scaffolding appropriately, celebrating progress, and creating adequate time for process writing.

## Pedagogical Approaches to Teaching Creative Writing

### Explicit Instruction and Apprenticeship

Research consistently supports explicit instruction in writing craft. The NATE and CLPE both advocate for approaches that combine immersion in literature with structured instruction in how texts work.

The apprenticeship model positions pupils as emerging writers learning from published authors through close analysis followed by structured opportunities to apply similar techniques.

### Modelling and Shared Writing

Modelling writing live, thinking aloud about decisions, and composing in front of pupils makes the writing process visible. Shared writing extends this by involving pupils in composition decisions, building pieces collaboratively before independent work.

### The Role of Reading in Writing Development

The National Curriculum's integration of reading and writing reflects research demonstrating strong relationships between reading experience and writing capability. Pupils who read extensively internalise narrative structures, syntactic patterns, and vocabulary that inform their own writing.
