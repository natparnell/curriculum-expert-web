# Rhetoric and Persuasion: Argument Structure, Rhetorical Devices, and Non-Fiction Analysis

## Overview

Rhetoric and persuasion constitute fundamental disciplinary knowledge within the English curriculum, encompassing the study of how language is crafted to influence, convince, and move audiences. This domain integrates the ancient art of rhetoric—originating with Aristotle's systematic analysis of persuasive discourse—with contemporary approaches to analysing and producing non-fiction texts. The National Curriculum for English (DfE, 2013) emphasises that pupils should be taught to "present ideas and issues" using rhetorical techniques, whilst exam specifications for GCSE English Language require students to both analyse persuasive language in unseen texts and produce their own argumentative and persuasive writing.

The teaching of rhetoric and persuasion serves multiple purposes: it develops critical literacy by enabling pupils to recognise how texts position readers; it cultivates oracy skills through structured speaking activities; and it empowers students to articulate their own views effectively in both academic and civic contexts. Ofsted's English subject report (2022) highlighted the importance of spoken language, noting that "the quality and variety of language that pupils hear and speak are key factors in developing their vocabulary and presenting a justification, argument or proof."

## Aristotelian Foundations: The Three Appeals

### Ethos (Credibility and Character)

Aristotle identified ethos as the persuasive appeal to the speaker's credibility, character, and authority. In rhetorical analysis, students learn to identify how writers establish trustworthiness and expertise with their audience. Ethos operates through several mechanisms:

**Establishing credentials**: Writers may cite qualifications, experience, or institutional affiliations to demonstrate authority on a subject. For example, a climate scientist writing about global warming establishes ethos by referencing their research background and publication record.

**Building common ground**: Effective rhetoricians connect with audiences by demonstrating shared values, experiences, or concerns. This alignment creates rapport and makes the audience more receptive to subsequent arguments.

**Demonstrating fairness**: Writers enhance ethos by acknowledging counter-arguments or presenting opposing views fairly before refuting them. This balanced approach signals intellectual honesty and strengthens the writer's position.

In classroom practice, teachers can ask pupils to analyse how celebrities in advertisements establish credibility, or how political speakers use personal anecdotes to connect with voters. The Reading Framework (DfE, 2023) suggests that such analysis should begin with concrete examples before introducing abstract terminology.

### Pathos (Emotional Appeal)

Pathos refers to the appeal to audience emotions, recognising that persuasion often operates through feeling as much as through reason. Effective rhetorical analysis requires pupils to identify which emotions a text seeks to evoke and how specific linguistic choices achieve this effect.

**Emotive vocabulary**: Word choices carry affective weight. Terms such as "catastrophe," "crisis," or "devastating" create urgency, whilst words like "hope," "opportunity," and "future" generate positive associations. The English Association (2022) notes that students themselves use emotional language in everyday discourse, and effective pedagogy builds on this existing awareness.

**Vivid imagery and anecdote**: Concrete, sensory details engage readers' emotions more powerfully than abstract claims. A charity appeal describing a specific child's circumstances creates stronger emotional response than statistics alone, though the combination of both (anecdote supported by data) often proves most effective.

**Identification and empathy**: Rhetoric encourages audiences to see themselves in described situations or to feel concern for others' experiences. This empathetic connection motivates action and acceptance of the speaker's position.

Teaching pathos requires sensitivity, particularly when analysing texts about suffering or injustice. Teachers should guide students to recognise emotional manipulation whilst also acknowledging that ethical persuasion legitimately engages feelings alongside reason.

### Logos (Logical Appeal)

Logos encompasses the rational structure of arguments, including evidence, reasoning, and organisational patterns. Developing pupils' understanding of logical argumentation supports both analysis and production of persuasive texts.

**Evidence types**: Writers employ statistics, expert testimony, case studies, and historical precedents to support claims. GCSE specifications require students to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of such evidence in given contexts.

**Reasoning patterns**: Common argumentative structures include:
- *Cause and effect*: Demonstrating how one phenomenon leads to another
- *Comparison and contrast*: Highlighting similarities or differences to support a position
- *Problem-solution*: Establishing a difficulty before proposing remedies
- *Deductive reasoning*: Moving from general principles to specific conclusions
- *Inductive reasoning*: Building general conclusions from specific examples

**Organisational coherence**: Logical persuasion depends upon clear connections between points. Transition words, signposting, and paragraph structure all contribute to the audience's ability to follow and accept an argument.

The Voice 21 Oracy Framework emphasises that cognitive skills—including reasoning, justification, and building on others' ideas—represent one of four essential strands of spoken language development. Integrating oracy activities with written rhetorical analysis reinforces both domains.

## Key Rhetorical Devices

### Figures of Speech and Sound Patterning

Rhetorical devices create memorable, impactful language through deliberate patterns. Understanding these techniques enables pupils to analyse how texts achieve their effects and to deploy similar strategies in their own writing.

**Alliteration and assonance**: The repetition of initial consonant sounds (alliteration) or internal vowel sounds (assonance) creates rhythm and emphasis. Churchill's "blood, toil, tears and sweat" employs alliteration to reinforce the gravity of his message. Such patterning makes phrases more memorable and emotionally resonant.

**Triples (rule of three)**: Grouping items in threes creates a sense of completeness and rhythmic satisfaction. The BBC Bitesize revision materials note that "safer streets means comfort, reassurance and peace of mind" demonstrates how triples can expand from a single concept to encompass broader benefits.

**Contrast and antithesis**: Setting opposing ideas against one another highlights differences and creates dramatic tension. Juxtaposing "free" and "tyranny" in political rhetoric, for instance, clarifies stakes and motivates action.

**Anaphora and epistrophe**: Repetition at the beginning of successive clauses (anaphora) or at the end (epistrophe) builds momentum and emphasis. Martin Luther King's "I have a dream" speech exemplifies anaphora's power to unify diverse examples under a common theme.

### Direct Address and Engagement Strategies

Persuasive texts employ various techniques to create connection between writer/speaker and audience.

**Personal pronouns**: The strategic use of "I," "you," "we," and "our" positions the audience in particular relationships with the speaker. "You" directly addresses readers, making arguments feel personally relevant. "We" creates imagined communities, suggesting shared identity and purpose. Analysis of the William Wallace speech in Braveheart (as cited in BBC Bitesize) demonstrates how pronouns shift to build solidarity: "I see a whole army of my countrymen" establishes the speaker's perspective, whilst "free men you are" directly addresses and empowers the audience.

**Rhetorical questions**: Questions requiring no answer engage audiences by prompting internal reflection. Anthony Cockerill (2024) warns that students should not "liberally scatter their responses with rhetorical devices," noting that responses structured rigidly around mnemonics like DAFOREST can feel artificial. Effective teaching helps pupils deploy questions strategically rather than mechanically.

**Imperatives and direct commands**: Instructional language creates urgency and clear calls to action. "Get on board and join us!" exemplifies how imperatives can motivate immediate response.

**Flattery and inclusive language**: Complimenting the audience—"A person of your intelligence deserves much better than this"—builds positive disposition toward the speaker's position whilst engaging readers' self-concept.

## Argument Structure and Organisation

### Classical Rhetorical Structure

The classical oration provides a model for organising persuasive discourse that remains relevant for contemporary teaching:

**Exordium (introduction)**: Capturing attention and establishing the speaker's credibility whilst introducing the topic. Modern equivalents include provocative questions, surprising statistics, or compelling anecdotes.

**Narratio (narration)**: Providing necessary background information and context. In non-fiction texts, this might include explaining the history of an issue or defining key terms.

**Confirmatio (confirmation)**: Developing the main arguments supporting the thesis. Each argument should feature a clear claim, supporting evidence, and explanation of relevance.

**Refutatio (refutation)**: Addressing counter-arguments and demonstrating why the speaker's position remains superior. This section enhances ethos by showing awareness of alternative viewpoints.

**Peroratio (conclusion)**: Summarising key points and issuing a call to action or final emotional appeal. Effective conclusions often return to themes established in the introduction, creating structural coherence.

### Contemporary Approaches to Argument Structure

Modern examinations and pedagogical frameworks emphasise structural clarity appropriate to specific purposes and audiences.

**Discursive essay structure**: For balanced exploration of issues, students learn to present multiple perspectives before reaching a justified conclusion. This format develops critical thinking by requiring engagement with complexity rather than immediate advocacy.

**Speech structure**: Oral presentations require attention to openings that capture attention, clear signposting throughout, and memorable closings. The physical and linguistic strands of the Voice 21 Oracy Framework highlight how delivery interacts with content in spoken persuasion.

**Transactional writing formats**: Letters, articles, and reviews each have conventional structures that students must master. Examination specifications require awareness of how format shapes content choices.

## Analysing Non-Fiction Texts

### Language Analysis Frameworks

GCSE English Language examinations require students to analyse how writers use language to influence or inform. Effective analytical approaches move beyond identification of techniques to explanation of effects.

**Word-level analysis**: Zooming in on specific vocabulary choices—considering connotations, register, and semantic fields. For instance, analysing how medical terminology creates clinical distance whilst emotive vocabulary generates concern.

**Sentence-level analysis**: Examining sentence length, type (declarative, interrogative, imperative), and structure. Short sentences create punch and urgency; longer complex sentences develop nuanced arguments.

**Whole-text patterns**: Identifying how rhetorical devices work cumulatively across texts. A single rhetorical question might have limited effect, but a pattern of questions building toward a conclusion creates sustained engagement.

The Pupil Smart Tuition guidance for AQA English Language Paper 2 Question 3 emphasises using "short, relevant quotes and always explaining the effect on the reader." This focus on textual evidence and reader response provides a manageable framework for students.

### Critical Literacy Perspectives

Beyond examination requirements, rhetoric and persuasion teaching develops critical literacy—the capacity to recognise how texts position readers and construct versions of reality.

**Recognising bias and perspective**: All texts emerge from particular viewpoints. Teaching pupils to identify implied values and assumptions enables more sophisticated analysis than simply labelling texts "biased" or "objective."

**Understanding audience design**: Writers craft language for specific readerships. Analysis should consider how vocabulary choices, assumed knowledge, and argumentative strategies reveal the intended audience.

**Evaluating evidence quality**: Not all persuasive appeals rest on equally strong foundations. Students should learn to assess the reliability, relevance, and sufficiency of evidence supporting claims.

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Integrating Oracy and Literacy

Ofsted's English subject report (2022) found that whilst many schools identify oracy as important, fewer have developed progressive curricula linking spoken and written language. Effective rhetoric and persuasion teaching integrates both domains.

**Discussion as preparation for writing**: Structured classroom talk—using strategies like Accountable Talk or Think-Pair-Share—helps pupils develop and refine arguments before committing them to writing. The Voice 21 framework's cognitive strand emphasises skills including "building on others' ideas" and "reasoning and justification" that transfer directly to written argumentation.

**Speech writing and performance**: Writing for oral delivery, then presenting to peers, develops awareness of how audience and medium shape language choices. Performance also builds confidence and physical presence.

**Debate and structured argument**: Formal debate formats teach respectful engagement with opposing views, rapid evidence deployment, and refutation strategies. These skills enhance both analytical and productive capacities.

### Scaffolding and Modelling

**Exemplar analysis**: Before expecting independent analysis, teachers should model the process using think-aloud protocols. Demonstrating how experienced readers move from quotation to interpretation builds students' analytical capabilities.

**Sentence stems and frames**: Providing structures such as "The writer uses [technique] to suggest [effect], which encourages the reader to [response]" supports early analytical writing whilst allowing focus on content rather than form.

**Progressive release of responsibility**: Beginning with guided identification of techniques, moving to paired analysis, and finally independent application follows established principles of effective instruction.

### Common Misconceptions and Challenges

**Technique spotting without analysis**: Students often identify rhetorical devices without explaining their effects or purposes. Explicit instruction should emphasise the "why" and "how" alongside the "what."

**Formulaic writing**: Anthony Cockerill (2024) notes that "responses structured around mnemonics like DAFOREST can feel artificial and constrained." Teachers should encourage flexible, purposeful deployment of techniques rather than mechanical inclusion.

**Confusing persuasion with mere description**: Young writers sometimes describe situations without making explicit arguments. Clarifying the distinction between informative and persuasive purposes helps focus writing appropriately.

**Over-reliance on emotion**: Whilst pathos matters, effective persuasion typically balances emotional and logical appeals. Students may need encouragement to develop evidentiary support alongside emotive language.

## Assessment and Examination Preparation

### GCSE English Language Requirements

Examination specifications from AQA, Edexcel, Eduqas, and OCR all include rhetoric and persuasion within their non-fiction components:

**Paper 2 Section A (reading)**: Students analyse unseen non-fiction texts, explaining how writers use language and structure to achieve effects. Rhetorical devices frequently feature in these analyses.

**Paper 2 Section B (writing)**: Students produce their own non-fiction texts, which may include articles, speeches, or letters requiring persuasive techniques. Assessment objectives require attention to audience, purpose, and register alongside technical accuracy.

### Developing Examination Skills

**Regular unseen practice**: Frequent exposure to diverse non-fiction texts builds confidence and analytical fluency. Texts should represent varied periods, purposes, and perspectives.

**Comparative analysis**: Some specifications require comparison of two texts. Teaching explicit comparison strategies—identifying similarities and differences in technique and effect—prepares students for these requirements.

**Timed writing practice**: Producing persuasive texts under examination conditions develops time management and planning skills. Feedback should address both rhetorical effectiveness and technical accuracy.

## Progression Across Key Stages

### Key Stage 1 and 2 Foundations

The National Curriculum introduces elements of persuasive speaking from the earliest years. KS1 pupils should "participate in discussions, presentations, performances, role play, improvisations and debates." By KS2, pupils engage with "formal presentations and debate" and begin recognising how language varies according to context.

Primary teaching lays groundwork through:
- Role-play activities exploring different viewpoints
- Discussion of advertisements and their persuasive strategies
- Simple identification of opinion versus fact
- Beginning to use evidence to support claims

### Key Stage 3 Development

The KS3 Programme of Study (QCDA, 2008) explicitly mentions "rhetorical devices" as part of language study. At this stage, pupils should:
- Analyse how writers adapt language for different audiences and purposes
- Produce persuasive texts showing awareness of rhetorical strategies
- Engage in structured debate and formal presentation
- Develop critical awareness of how texts position readers

### Key Stage 4 and GCSE

GCSE specifications consolidate and examine rhetoric and persuasion knowledge. By this stage, students should:
- Deploy sophisticated analytical vocabulary accurately
- Evaluate the effectiveness of rhetorical strategies in specific contexts
- Produce convincing persuasive texts adapted to precise purposes and audiences
- Demonstrate critical awareness of how language constructs versions of reality

## Conclusion

Rhetoric and persuasion represent essential disciplinary knowledge within English, connecting ancient intellectual traditions with contemporary communication skills. Effective teaching develops pupils' capacities to analyse how texts position readers and to produce their own convincing arguments for diverse purposes and audiences. By integrating written and spoken approaches, building from concrete examples to abstract principles, and maintaining focus on purpose and effect rather than mere technique-spotting, teachers can develop students' critical literacy and empower them as confident communicators in academic, professional, and civic contexts.

The domain demands ongoing attention to how language functions in real-world contexts—from political discourse to advertising, from academic argument to social advocacy. As the English Association observed in response to Ofsted's curriculum review, students already use rhetorical features in everyday discourse; effective pedagogy recognises and builds upon this existing competence, making explicit the knowledge and skills that enable powerful communication.
