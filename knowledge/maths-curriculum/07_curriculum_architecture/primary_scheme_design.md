# Primary Mathematics Scheme Design: Blocked, Mixed and Mastery Approaches

## Introduction

The design of primary mathematics schemes of work represents one of the most significant curriculum decisions a school leadership team can make. Since the 2014 National Curriculum reforms and the subsequent adoption of teaching for mastery approaches, schools have faced increasingly complex choices about how to structure their mathematics provision. This knowledge base examines the three dominant scheme designs currently operating in English primary schools: blocked curricula (mastery-aligned), mixed-attainment approaches, and the integrated models that attempt to combine elements of both.

The Department for Education's (DfE, 2021) guidance for Key Stages 1 and 2 emphasises curriculum coherence and the "ready-to-progress" criteria—core conceptual knowledge that pupils need at each stage. Ofsted's Education Inspection Framework (2019) places substantial weight on curriculum intent, implementation and impact, with mathematics receiving particular scrutiny during inspections. Understanding the structural differences between scheme designs is therefore essential for school leaders seeking to demonstrate curriculum quality.

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of blocked, mixed and mastery curriculum designs, examining their theoretical foundations, practical implementation requirements, and the evidence base for each approach. It considers how different designs support the National Curriculum statutory requirements, the implications for teacher workload and professional development, and the practical considerations for mixed-age and single-form entry contexts.

## The Blocked Curriculum Model

### Defining Characteristics

The blocked curriculum model organises mathematical content into discrete, concentrated units of study. Under this approach, pupils focus intensively on a single mathematical domain—such as place value, addition and subtraction, or fractions—for a sustained period, typically ranging from two to four weeks, before transitioning to a new topic. The blocked approach is the dominant organisational structure in commercially available primary mathematics schemes, including White Rose Maths, Power Maths and Maths — No Problem.

The theoretical rationale for blocking draws on cognitive science research suggesting that concentrated practice within a domain can support the development of procedural fluency and the formation of strong neural pathways (NCETM, 2016). By maintaining focus on related concepts, teachers can design sequences that build systematically, with each lesson connecting directly to what has come before within the same domain. This coherence within blocks is particularly emphasised in mastery-aligned schemes, where small, incremental steps are designed to build conceptual understanding progressively.

### Implementation in Mastery Schemes

White Rose Maths, the most widely adopted primary scheme in England, exemplifies the blocked approach. Their schemes of learning divide each term into distinct blocks: Autumn Term typically begins with place value, followed by addition and subtraction, then multiplication and division. Spring and Summer Terms introduce blocks on fractions, geometry, measurement and statistics, with the precise ordering varying by year group.

Power Maths, published by Pearson in partnership with White Rose Maths, follows an identical block structure. As Pearson (2026) notes, Power Maths represents "the only whole-class mastery programme fully aligned with the White Rose Maths progressions and schemes of learning." The alignment ensures that schools adopting either resource follow a fundamentally similar curricular journey, with differences primarily in the materials and pedagogical guidance rather than the organisational structure.

The blocked model within mastery schemes is not merely organisational; it reflects the "Five Big Ideas" articulated by the NCETM (2017): coherence, representation and structure, mathematical thinking, fluency, and variation. Coherence—the first big idea—is achieved by designing small, connected steps that gradually unfold a concept within the protective container of a block. Teachers are discouraged from moving pupils forward until the majority have grasped the concept, with differentiation occurring through depth rather than acceleration.

### Advantages of the Blocked Approach

The blocked curriculum offers several practical advantages that have contributed to its widespread adoption. From a planning perspective, blocked units allow teachers to concentrate their preparatory work within a single mathematical domain, developing deep subject knowledge of the specific concepts and common misconceptions before teaching begins. This concentration can reduce the cognitive load associated with daily planning across disparate topics.

For pupils, the sustained focus on related concepts provides extended opportunity to develop procedural fluency. The NCETM (2016) emphasises that "intelligent practice"—carefully constructed sequences of questions that draw attention to mathematical structure—requires sufficient time within a topic to be effective. Blocked curricula provide this time, enabling pupils to move from initial exposure through guided practice to independent application within a coherent sequence.

Assessment is also simplified within a blocked model. End-of-block assessments can target specific domains with precision, providing teachers with granular information about pupil attainment within particular strands of mathematics. The DfE's (2021) ready-to-progress criteria are organised by year group and content domain, aligning naturally with blocked curriculum structures that address each domain sequentially.

### Limitations and Critiques

Despite its prevalence, the blocked approach has attracted significant criticism from researchers and practitioners. The most substantial concern relates to the "spacing effect"—the well-established finding from cognitive psychology that distributed practice across time produces more durable learning than massed practice within concentrated blocks (Dempster, 1988; Cepeda et al., 2006).

In a pure blocked curriculum, pupils may not revisit a topic for many months after completing the initial block. By the time fractions reappear in the following term or year, earlier learning may have decayed significantly, requiring substantial review before new content can be introduced. This phenomenon is particularly problematic for pupils who struggle to secure understanding during the initial block; the concentrated timeframe may not allow sufficient time for the multiple exposures needed for durable learning.

Boyd (2014) argues that while blocking may appear efficient, it can produce "illusion of competence"—pupils appear to understand during the block but struggle to apply knowledge when the topic is encountered in isolation later. This critique has led some schools and schemes to incorporate elements of spacing within an otherwise blocked structure, creating hybrid models that attempt to combine the coherence of blocking with the retention benefits of distributed practice.

## The Mixed-Attainment Teaching Model

### Philosophical Foundations

Mixed-attainment teaching, sometimes termed mixed-ability teaching, represents a fundamentally different approach to curriculum organisation and classroom practice. Rather than grouping pupils by prior attainment (whether within or between classes), mixed-attainment approaches deliberately create classrooms containing the full range of pupil achievement. Differentiation occurs through task design and teacher support rather than through grouping by ability.

The philosophical foundation for mixed-attainment teaching rests on a commitment to equity and the belief that all pupils can succeed in mathematics given appropriate support and opportunity. Drury (2018) articulates this position clearly: grouping by prior attainment limits opportunity for those placed in lower sets, with the negative effects particularly pronounced for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF, 2018) identifies setting and streaming as having a negative impact on low-attaining pupils' outcomes while showing little benefit for high attainers.

Mixed-attainment approaches align closely with mastery pedagogies that emphasise "keeping the class together" and believing that every child can succeed (NCETM, 2017). However, while mastery approaches can be implemented within setted contexts, mixed-attainment teaching makes heterogeneous grouping a non-negotiable structural feature of the curriculum.

### Structuring Mixed-Attainment Classrooms

Implementing mixed-attainment teaching requires substantial curriculum redesign. The NCETM (2021) case studies of schools successfully implementing this approach identify several common structural features. At Richard Taylor Primary School, for example, teachers employ "learning ladders"—differentiated success criteria within shared objectives—that allow pupils to work at different levels within the same mathematical topic.

Sentence stems and carefully planned micro-progressions enable teachers to maintain a shared focus while supporting individual progression. The use of manipulatives, models and images becomes particularly important in mixed-attainment contexts, as these representations can make mathematical structure visible and accessible across a range of prior attainment levels.

Mixed-attainment classes require particular attention to task design. Tasks must be "low threshold, high ceiling"—accessible to all pupils while offering scope for extension and challenge. The Nrich Mathematics Project has developed extensive resources based on this principle, and many mixed-attainment schools draw on these materials to support their curriculum implementation.

### The Role of Pre-Assessment

Effective mixed-attainment teaching relies on precise formative assessment to identify what each pupil already knows and can do. At the beginning of each topic, teachers conduct pre-assessments that inform planning and enable targeted support. This assessment is not used to create groups but rather to ensure that teaching addresses the specific gaps and misconceptions that pupils bring to the topic.

The NCETM (2021) describes how one school uses pre-assessment to create flexible "learning ladders" within shared objectives. Pupils work through success criteria at their own pace, with higher prior-attaining pupils exploring generalisations and articulating misconceptions while SEND pupils strengthen foundational skills. This approach maintains the coherence of whole-class teaching while accommodating the inevitable variation in pupil readiness.

### Challenges and Implementation Barriers

Mixed-attainment teaching, while theoretically attractive, presents substantial implementation challenges. Teacher subject knowledge must be broad and deep, as teachers need to understand the full range of pupil thinking within a topic, from foundational misconceptions through to sophisticated generalisations. This requirement has significant implications for professional development and teacher training.

Resources for mixed-attainment teaching remain less developed than those for blocked, mastery-aligned schemes. While materials from Nrich and the NCETM provide valuable support, few commercial schemes offer comprehensive mixed-attainment pathways. Schools adopting this approach often invest significant time in adapting existing resources or developing their own curriculum materials.

Parental and stakeholder perception can also present barriers. The prevalence of setting in secondary education means that many parents expect their children to be grouped by ability, and may express concern about mixed-attainment arrangements. School leaders need clear communication strategies to explain the rationale and evidence base for their approach.

## The Spiral Curriculum Model

### Bruner's Theoretical Framework

The spiral curriculum, first articulated by Jerome Bruner (1960), offers an alternative to both pure blocking and mixed-attainment models. Bruner proposed that curriculum content should be revisited repeatedly at increasing levels of depth, detail and sophistication. Rather than treating topics as units to be completed and moved on from, the spiral model treats mathematical ideas as threads that weave through the curriculum, appearing and reappearing with greater complexity across the school year and key stages.

Kosheleva and Villaverde (2018) argue that the spiral approach more accurately reflects the nature of mathematical learning, in which understanding is constructed gradually through multiple encounters with concepts in varying contexts. The spiral model acknowledges that genuine understanding cannot be achieved in a single concentrated block but requires repeated exposure with consolidation and extension.

### The Spacing Effect and Distributed Practice

The spiral model aligns with one of the most robust findings from learning sciences research: the spacing effect. First identified by Ebbinghaus (1885) and repeatedly confirmed across more than a century of research, the spacing effect demonstrates that distributed practice—spreading learning across time—produces more durable retention than massed practice within concentrated blocks (Cepeda et al., 2006).

Everyday Mathematics, the spiral curriculum developed at the University of Chicago, explicitly incorporates spacing as a design principle. The curriculum revisits concepts regularly rather than concentrating them in blocks, with each encounter building on previous learning and preparing the ground for future development. Research on Everyday Mathematics has found that pupils following the spiral curriculum demonstrate stronger long-term retention than those following blocked curricula, even when the blocked curriculum produces higher short-term performance (Carroll, 1996).

### Implementation in UK Contexts

Pure spiral curricula remain relatively rare in English primary schools, with most commercial schemes favouring blocked or hybrid approaches. However, elements of spiralling are increasingly incorporated into mastery-aligned schemes. White Rose Maths, for example, includes "Flashback 4" starters that revisit prior content daily, providing spaced practice within an otherwise blocked structure.

The NCETM's Curriculum Prioritisation materials (2021) incorporate spiral elements through their design of linked concepts across terms. While topics are still organised in blocks, the materials emphasise connections between blocks and the importance of revisiting prior learning before introducing new content. This represents a pragmatic adaptation of spiral principles within a broadly blocked structure.

### Critiques of Pure Spiral Approaches

Critics of spiral curricula argue that the approach can produce fragmented understanding, with pupils never experiencing the sustained focus needed to develop deep conceptual knowledge. The DfE's (2021) ready-to-progress criteria imply a need for concentrated attention on specific concepts at particular points in pupils' mathematical development, potentially conflicting with the spiral model's emphasis on distributed exposure.

Ofsted's (2019) focus on curriculum coherence also presents challenges for pure spiral designs. Inspectors look for logical sequences in which component knowledge is integrated into larger concepts; the spiral model's repeated revisiting of topics can make such sequences harder to articulate. Schools adopting spiral approaches need to be particularly clear about how each encounter with a topic builds on previous learning and prepares for future development.

## The Mastery Synthesis: Integrating Blocked and Spiral Elements

### The Five Big Ideas and Curriculum Structure

The NCETM's (2017) articulation of the Five Big Ideas for teaching mathematics for mastery has become the dominant framework for curriculum design in English primary schools. While these ideas are primarily pedagogical—concerned with how mathematics is taught—they have significant implications for curriculum structure.

Coherence, the first big idea, requires that teaching "is designed to enable the class to work together as a whole, whilst addressing the need for all pupils to master the curriculum." This has been interpreted as favouring blocked curricula that keep the class focused on shared content. However, coherence can also be achieved through carefully designed spiral sequences in which all pupils engage with the same topic at appropriately differentiated levels of depth.

Representation and structure, mathematical thinking, fluency, and variation all influence curriculum design decisions. The emphasis on concrete-pictorial-abstract (CPA) representations requires time within topics for pupils to work through each stage. The focus on mathematical thinking suggests tasks that extend beyond procedural practice to require reasoning and problem-solving. These pedagogical commitments shape how schemes are structured and sequenced.

### Commercial Mastery Schemes: Hybrid Designs

Contemporary commercial mastery schemes represent sophisticated syntheses of blocked and spiral elements. White Rose Maths exemplifies this hybridity: the overall structure is blocked, with concentrated units on particular topics, but within and between blocks there is careful attention to revisiting prior learning and making connections across mathematical domains.

The "small steps" approach characteristic of mastery schemes can be understood as micro-spiralling within blocks. Rather than practising a single procedure repeatedly, pupils work through carefully varied examples that draw attention to mathematical structure. This variation represents distributed attention to different aspects of a concept, potentially capturing some of the benefits of spacing within a concentrated timeframe.

Power Maths and Maths — No Problem! follow similar hybrid designs. Both use blocked structures for organisational coherence while incorporating elements of spaced practice and connection-making that reflect spiral curriculum principles. The DfE (2016) funded the adoption of these East Asian-influenced approaches through the Maths Hubs network, establishing them as the default curriculum structure for schools engaging with mastery.

### The Role of Same-Day Intervention

A distinctive feature of mastery implementations is the practice of same-day intervention—providing immediate additional support to pupils who have not grasped the day's learning, while the majority move on together. This practice reconciles the goal of keeping the class together with the reality of variation in pupil progress.

Same-day intervention requires organisational structures that may not be available in all schools. Some schools deploy teaching assistants or additional teachers to provide immediate support; others adjust the following day's teaching to address gaps. The NCETM (2017) emphasises that this intervention must happen on the same day, before new learning builds upon insecure foundations.

### Adapting Mastery for Mixed-Age Settings

Approximately one-third of English primary schools operate mixed-age classes, creating particular challenges for mastery curriculum implementation. The NCETM (2021) has developed specific guidance for these contexts, emphasising that mastery principles can and should be adapted rather than abandoned.

The two-year rolling programme is a common adaptation, in which curriculum content is organised across two-year cycles to accommodate classes containing pupils from two year groups. Within this structure, anchor units provide opportunities for pupils to revisit and deepen understanding of key concepts. Higher prior-attaining pupils explore generalisations and articulate misconceptions while lower-attaining pupils strengthen foundational skills.

Careful planning is required to ensure that the rolling programme does not disadvantage particular year groups or create gaps in progression. The NCETM recommends that schools map their programmes carefully against the ready-to-progress criteria to ensure full curriculum coverage over the two-year cycle.

## Evidence and Evaluation

### Research on Mastery Approaches

The evidence base for teaching for mastery has grown substantially since the DfE's (2016) investment in the approach. The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF, 2015) evaluated the Mathematics Mastery programme, finding a small positive impact on pupil attainment (effect size +0.10) at a cost of approximately £8 per pupil per year. The evaluation noted that impacts were larger for earlier year groups, suggesting that mastery approaches may be particularly effective when introduced in Key Stage 1.

A systematic review by Jerrim and Vignoles (2016) examined the East Asian approaches that influenced English mastery programmes. They found that while these approaches are associated with high performance in international comparisons, the specific features responsible for this success are difficult to isolate. High-quality teaching, strong mathematical subject knowledge, and cultural factors related to attitudes towards education may be as important as specific curriculum structures.

Ofsted's (2023) subject report on mathematics noted that while many schools have adopted mastery schemes, implementation varies considerably. The report found that "in too many schools, the focus on procedural fluency has come at the expense of conceptual understanding and problem-solving." This finding suggests that curriculum structure alone is insufficient; the quality of implementation matters profoundly.

### Comparative Studies: Blocked, Mixed and Spiral

Direct comparative studies of curriculum structures in English primary schools remain limited. Most available research examines specific schemes rather than structural approaches, making it difficult to isolate the effects of blocking versus spiralling or mixed-attainment organisation.

Research on mixed-attainment grouping by the EEF (2018) found no consistent impact on overall attainment, with benefits for lower-attaining pupils potentially offset by small negative effects on higher attainers. However, this research examined grouping structures rather than curriculum designs; mixed-attainment teaching as a curricular approach (with associated task design and pedagogical practices) may have different effects from simply placing pupils of different attainments in the same classroom.

International comparative research provides some insights. TIMSS data suggests that high-performing jurisdictions employ varying curriculum structures, with East Asian systems typically using blocked approaches while some European systems employ more spiral designs. This variation suggests that no single structure is necessary for high performance; implementation quality and teacher expertise may be more significant than structural choices.
