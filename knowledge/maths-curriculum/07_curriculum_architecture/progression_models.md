# Progression Models in Mathematics: Coherence Across Key Stages

## Overview

Progression models in mathematics education describe the structured pathways through which pupils develop mathematical understanding from early years through to Key Stage 4 and beyond. Unlike subjects where knowledge can be compartmentalised, mathematics is fundamentally cumulative—each new concept builds upon prior learning in intricate and often non-linear ways. The DfE (2020) emphasises that "pupils need to master crucial conceptual knowledge before they can progress to more advanced learning," highlighting the importance of coherent progression models that identify critical junctures in mathematical development.

This knowledge file examines the major progression frameworks used in English schools, exploring how they conceptualise mathematical development across key stages, the theoretical underpinnings that inform their design, and the practical implications for curriculum planning and classroom pedagogy.

## Theoretical Foundations of Mathematical Progression

### Constructivist Perspectives

Progression models in mathematics are heavily influenced by constructivist learning theories, particularly the work of Jean Piaget and Lev Vygotsky. Piaget's stage theory of cognitive development provided early frameworks for understanding how children's mathematical thinking evolves, from pre-operational thinking in early childhood through to formal operational reasoning in adolescence. However, contemporary progression models move beyond rigid stage-based conceptions, recognising that mathematical development is domain-specific and influenced significantly by instruction and experience.

Vygotsky's concept of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) has proved particularly influential in shaping how progression models conceptualise the "next steps" in learning. The ZPD suggests that progression occurs when learners are supported to tackle problems just beyond their current independent capabilities—a principle that underpins the design of carefully sequenced curriculum content. NCETM (2021) notes that "for maximum impact on student learning, teachers need to work with a curriculum or scheme of work which offers clear and coherent sequencing of mathematical ideas, both within each year and across the year groups."

### The Role of Representations in Progression

A central insight from mathematics education research is that conceptual progression is intimately connected to representational progression. Jerome Bruner's enactive-iconic-symbolic framework—often operationalised in English schools as the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach—provides a powerful model for understanding how mathematical understanding develops through increasingly sophisticated representational forms.

The CPA approach recognises that mathematical concepts can be accessed through multiple representational channels: concrete manipulatives (physical objects), pictorial representations (diagrams, images), and abstract symbols (numerals, algebraic notation). Progression is not simply a matter of moving from concrete to abstract, but of building rich connections between these representational modes. As the NCETM materials emphasise, pupils should be able to move fluidly between representations, using concrete materials to support abstract thinking and abstract reasoning to inform concrete exploration.

## Major Progression Frameworks in English Mathematics Education

### The Ready-to-Progress Criteria (DfE, 2020)

The most significant recent development in progression modelling for primary mathematics is the Department for Education's Mathematics Guidance for Key Stages 1 and 2, published in June 2020. This guidance identifies "ready-to-progress criteria"—the most important conceptual knowledge and understanding that pupils need as they progress from Year 1 to Year 6.

#### Structure and Organisation

The ready-to-progress criteria are organised around six key strands:

1. **Number and Place Value**: Understanding of our number system, including the structure of decimal numbers and the relationships between numbers
2. **Number Facts**: Rapid recall of key facts, particularly addition and subtraction facts to 20, and multiplication and division facts to 12 × 12
3. **Addition and Subtraction**: Conceptual understanding of these operations and efficient calculation strategies
4. **Multiplication and Division**: Understanding of multiplicative structures, including the relationship between these operations and their application to fractions and scaling
5. **Fractions**: Understanding of fractions as numbers, including equivalence and the relationship to decimals
6. **Geometry**: Spatial reasoning and understanding of geometric properties

For each year group, the guidance specifies a small number of ready-to-progress criteria—typically three to six per year—that represent the essential conceptual foundations for subsequent learning. For example, by the end of Year 2, pupils should be able to "recognise the place value of each digit in two-digit numbers, and compose and decompose two-digit numbers using standard and non-standard partitioning"—a criterion that underpins understanding of the decimal number system throughout primary and into secondary education.

#### Pedagogical Implications

The ready-to-progress criteria represent a shift from coverage-focused curriculum planning to prioritisation of foundational concepts. The guidance explicitly states that schools should allocate sufficient time to ensure pupils master these criteria before moving on to new content. This has significant implications for curriculum design:

- **Time allocation**: The guidance suggests that priority content should receive greater time allocation, with some areas moved between year groups within the same key stage to improve coherence
- **Intervention focus**: The criteria provide a clear framework for identifying pupils who have gaps in foundational knowledge and targeting intervention accordingly
- **Assessment design**: Rather than assessing all curriculum content equally, assessment should prioritise whether pupils have mastered the ready-to-progress criteria

### The NCETM Primary Mastery Professional Development Materials (Spines)

Complementing the ready-to-progress criteria, the NCETM has developed comprehensive professional development materials organised around three "spines": Number, Addition and Subtraction; Multiplication and Division; and Fractions. These materials provide a detailed progression model that breaks down each spine into segments representing small, coherent steps in learning.

#### The Spine Structure

Each spine is composed of multiple segments, with each segment representing a carefully sequenced learning episode. Unlike commercial schemes, the spines are not designed to be directly used as lesson plans. Instead, they provide:

- **Detailed pedagogical guidance** on how concepts develop
- **Representations and models** that support understanding at each stage
- **Common misconceptions** and how to address them
- **Language and vocabulary** that should be developed

The recommended teaching sequence for segments across the three spines has been carefully designed to ensure that prior learning supports subsequent understanding. For example, the Multiplication and Division spine builds directly on concepts developed in the Number, Addition and Subtraction spine, with explicit attention to how additive and multiplicative structures relate.

#### The Role of Mathematical Representations

A distinctive feature of the spine materials is their emphasis on mathematical representations as tools for progression. The materials introduce specific representations—such as the part-whole model, the bar model, and the array—and show how these can be used across multiple areas of mathematics to expose underlying structures. This representational coherence supports pupils in making connections between topics and seeing mathematics as a connected whole rather than isolated procedures.

### The Key Stage 3 Mathematics Guidance (DfE, 2021)

Following the publication of guidance for Key Stages 1 and 2, the DfE and NCETM released non-statutory guidance for Key Stage 3 mathematics in September 2021. This guidance aims to "bring greater coherence to the national curriculum for mathematics by exemplifying the statutory guidance for Key Stage 3 and giving schools, mathematics departments and teachers further guidance on how learning in mathematics develops across Key Stage 3."

#### Coherence and Connection

The KS3 guidance is explicitly designed to support coherence by:

- **Exposing connections** between different mathematical topics
- **Showing how topics link back to KS2** and forward to KS4
- **Providing exemplification** of how concepts develop in complexity

The guidance identifies six major themes that structure mathematical content across KS3:

1. **Place Value, Face Value, Value and Number Properties**
2. **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division**
3. **Fractions, Ratio and Percentages**
4. **Algebraic Thinking**
5. **Geometry and Measurement**
6. **Statistics and Probability**

Within each theme, the guidance shows how learning progresses from Year 7 through to Year 9, with explicit attention to how KS2 foundations are built upon and how KS4 demands are prepared for. This vertical coherence is a central organising principle of the guidance.

#### Addressing the Primary-Secondary Transition

A particular focus of the KS3 guidance is supporting the transition from primary to secondary education. Research consistently shows that this transition is a point of significant risk for mathematical progress, with many pupils experiencing a "dip" in performance. The guidance addresses this by:

- **Valuing KS2 learning**: The guidance recognises the sophisticated mathematics that pupils have encountered in primary school, rather than assuming they need to start again
- **Making connections explicit**: Teachers are encouraged to show pupils how KS3 topics connect to what they already know
- **Common representations**: The guidance promotes the continued use of representations familiar from primary school, such as bar models and part-whole diagrams

### GCSE Progression Models

At Key Stage 4, progression models are primarily structured around the demands of GCSE Mathematics, with particular attention to the distinction between Foundation and Higher tier content. However, effective progression models for KS4 recognise that GCSE preparation begins long before Year 10.

#### The Foundation-Higher Continuum

The tiered nature of GCSE Mathematics creates particular challenges for progression modelling. Pupils following the Foundation tier can achieve grades 1-5, while Higher tier pupils can achieve grades 4-9. This structure means that:

- **Overlap content** (grades 4-5) must be taught to all pupils, with careful attention to depth of understanding
- **Foundation-only content** requires focused teaching to ensure pupils can access the highest grades available to them
- **Higher-only content** builds on foundations laid in KS3, with particular attention to algebraic fluency and abstract reasoning

Progression models for KS4 therefore need to be responsive to pupils' current attainment while maintaining ambitious expectations. The AQA, Edexcel, and OCR specifications all provide progression pathways that map content to approximate grade boundaries, though these should be treated flexibly given the nature of holistic mark schemes at GCSE.

## Dimensions of Mathematical Progression

Effective progression models recognise that mathematical development occurs along multiple interconnected dimensions. Understanding these dimensions helps teachers to design curricula and plan lessons that support comprehensive mathematical development.

### Conceptual Progression

Conceptual progression refers to the deepening understanding of mathematical concepts and structures. This is the dimension most commonly addressed in progression models, and includes:

- **Number sense**: Understanding of number relationships, magnitude, and the structure of the number system
- **Operational understanding**: Understanding what operations mean, how they relate to each other, and when to apply them
- **Proportional reasoning**: Understanding multiplicative relationships, including fractions, ratios, and percentages
- **Functional thinking**: Understanding how quantities relate to each other and how changes in one quantity affect another

Conceptual progression is typically non-linear, with pupils often showing understanding in some contexts before others. Effective progression models allow for this variability, providing multiple opportunities to encounter and apply concepts.

### Procedural Progression

Procedural progression refers to the development of fluency with mathematical procedures—algorithms, methods, and calculation strategies. This dimension includes:

- **Mental calculation strategies**: Increasingly efficient and flexible approaches to mental calculation
- **Written calculation methods**: Development of standard written methods for the four operations
- **Algebraic manipulation**: Fluency with algebraic techniques including solving equations, simplifying expressions, and factorising
- **Geometric constructions**: Skill with compass and straightedge constructions, and later with dynamic geometry software

The relationship between conceptual and procedural progression is bidirectional. Conceptual understanding supports procedural fluency by providing meaning to procedures, while procedural fluency can support conceptual development by freeing cognitive resources for higher-order thinking. The NCETM (2021) emphasises that "procedural fluency and conceptual understanding must be developed in tandem."

### Representational Progression

As noted above, progression in mathematics is closely tied to progression in the use of representations. This dimension includes:

- **Concrete materials**: Progression from simple counting objects to structured materials like Dienes blocks, Cuisenaire rods, and algebra tiles
- **Pictorial representations**: Development from simple drawings to sophisticated diagrams like bar models, number lines, and graphs
- **Abstract symbols**: Increasing fluency with mathematical notation, from numerals through to algebraic notation
- **Technology**: Progression from simple calculators to graphing software, dynamic geometry, and computer algebra systems

A key insight from research is that representational progression is not simply a matter of abandoning earlier representational forms as pupils move to more advanced ones. Rather, effective mathematicians maintain access to the full range of representations, selecting the most appropriate tool for the problem at hand.

### Reasoning Progression

Mathematical reasoning—conjecturing, justifying, and proving—represents a crucial dimension of mathematical progression. This includes:

- **Pattern spotting**: Identifying and continuing patterns in numbers, shapes, and sequences
- **Conjecturing and generalising**: Making and testing conjectures about mathematical situations
- **Justification**: Providing reasons for mathematical statements, moving from empirical justification (it works for these examples) to deductive reasoning
- **Proof**: Understanding and constructing formal mathematical proofs, particularly at higher GCSE and beyond

The progression from empirical to deductive reasoning is a significant development in pupils' mathematical thinking, typically emerging during Key Stage 3 and developing through Key Stage 4 and beyond.

## Common Challenges in Mathematical Progression

Understanding typical challenges and misconceptions in mathematical progression helps teachers to anticipate difficulties and design responsive instruction.

### The Whole Number Bias

Research consistently identifies a "whole number bias"—the tendency for pupils to apply whole number reasoning inappropriately to fractions, decimals, and algebra. For example, pupils may reason that 1/4 is larger than 1/3 because 4 is larger than 3, or that 0.25 is larger than 0.3 because 25 is larger than 3. This bias reflects the deep learning of whole number magnitudes in early years and primary education, and the challenge of reorganising this knowledge to accommodate new number types.

Progression models must therefore explicitly address how understanding of the number system needs to be extended and reorganised. The NCETM Fractions spine, for example, devotes significant attention to helping pupils understand fractions as numbers with magnitudes that can be compared and ordered, rather than simply as parts of wholes.

### The Multiplicative Shift

The transition from additive to multiplicative thinking represents a significant conceptual leap. Multiplicative structures are not simply repeated addition—while 3 × 4 can be calculated as 4 + 4 + 4, understanding multiplication requires grasping ratio, scaling, and proportional relationships that cannot be reduced to additive thinking.

Progression models need to support this "multiplicative shift" by:
- **Explicitly teaching multiplicative structures**, including the different problem types that require multiplication or division
- **Using representations** that expose multiplicative relationships, such as the array and the area model
- **Connecting multiplication** to fractions, ratio, and scaling from early stages

### The Algebra Transition

The transition from arithmetic to algebra is widely recognised as a critical and challenging point in mathematical progression. Common difficulties include:

- **The equals sign**: Understanding equality as a relationship rather than a signal to calculate
- **Letters as variables**: Moving from viewing letters as representing specific unknowns to understanding them as variables that can take multiple values
- **Abstract symbolism**: Managing the high symbolic load of algebraic expressions and equations

Effective progression models introduce algebraic thinking from early primary years through pattern-spotting and generalisation, building towards formal algebra in a gradual and connected way.

## Implementing Progression Models in Curriculum Planning

### Whole-School Coherence

For progression models to be effective, they need to be implemented consistently across a school or department. This requires:

- **Shared understanding**: All teachers need to understand the progression model being used and how concepts develop
- **Collaborative planning**: Teachers working together to plan sequences of learning that follow coherent progressions
- **Consistent language and representations**: Using the same mathematical language and representations across year groups

The NCETM (2021) emphasises that "collaboration: teachers working together to agree curriculum sequencing and approaches" is key to bringing greater coherence to the curriculum.

### Responsive Teaching Within Progression Frameworks

While progression models provide a valuable framework, they must not become straitjackets that prevent responsive teaching. Effective teachers:

- **Use progression models diagnostically** to identify gaps in prior learning and plan appropriate support
- **Adjust pace** based on pupils' developing understanding, spending longer on foundational concepts when needed
- **Make connections explicit**, helping pupils see how new learning relates to what they already know
- **Anticipate and address misconceptions** that are predictable at particular points in progression

### Assessment for Progression

Assessment plays a crucial role in supporting progression. Effective assessment practices:

- **Focus on conceptual understanding**, not just procedural fluency
- **Identify gaps in foundational knowledge** that may block future progress
- **Provide feedback** that helps pupils understand their next steps in learning
- **Monitor progress** towards the ready-to-progress criteria at primary level

The DfE ready-to-progress criteria provide a valuable framework for assessment, helping teachers to identify the most important conceptual milestones and focus assessment attention on these.

## Progression Models and Educational Equity

### Addressing Gaps in Foundational Knowledge

Progression models have important implications for educational equity. Because mathematics is so highly cumulative, gaps in foundational knowledge can have compounding effects, with pupils who fall behind finding it increasingly difficult to access new content. The ready-to-progress criteria and associated materials provide a framework for identifying and addressing these gaps systematically.

### High Expectations for All

Effective progression models are premised on the belief that all pupils can succeed in mathematics given appropriate instruction and support. The mastery approach, which underpins much current progression thinking in England, explicitly rejects the idea that some pupils "can't do maths." Instead, it recognises that pupils may need different amounts of time and support to master concepts, but that with appropriate teaching, all can make progress through the same progression pathways.

## Conclusion

Progression models in mathematics provide essential frameworks for curriculum planning, pedagogy, and assessment. From the ready-to-progress criteria that identify foundational concepts in primary mathematics, through the detailed spine materials that map conceptual development, to the KS3 guidance that supports coherence across the primary-secondary transition, these models offer valuable support for teachers seeking to help all pupils develop deep and connected mathematical understanding.

Effective use of progression models requires more than simply following a sequence of content. It demands deep subject knowledge to understand why concepts are sequenced in particular ways, pedagogical skill to navigate the inevitable variations in pupils' developing understanding, and collaborative working to ensure coherence across classes and year groups. When implemented thoughtfully, however, progression models provide a powerful means of ensuring that all pupils can experience
