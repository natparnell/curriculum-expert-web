# Jo Boaler: Growth Mindset and Mathematical Mindsets

## Biography and Academic Background

Jo Boaler (born 1964) is a British education author and researcher who currently serves as the Nomellini–Olivier Professor of Education at the Stanford Graduate School of Education. Her career has spanned both sides of the Atlantic, combining teaching experience in London comprehensive schools with influential research positions at King's College London and Stanford University. This dual perspective—grounded in UK classroom practice and informed by cutting-edge US research—has shaped her distinctive approach to mathematics education reform.

Boaler began her career as a mathematics teacher in London comprehensive schools before pursuing advanced study at King's College London, where she earned both her Master's degree and PhD in Mathematics Education. Her doctoral research won the national award for educational research from the British Educational Research Association in 1997, and her subsequent book *Experiencing School Mathematics* received the 'Outstanding Book of the Year' award for education in Britain. These early accolades established her reputation as a significant voice in mathematics education research.

Following her work at King's College, Boaler held the prestigious Marie Curie Professorship of Mathematics Education at the University of Sussex, where she continued her research into classroom practices and their effects on student learning. In 2010, she returned to Stanford University, where she has built one of the world's leading centres for mathematics education research and professional development.

## Founding YouCubed

In 2013, Boaler co-founded youcubed, a Stanford-based research centre dedicated to transforming mathematics education through the application of growth mindset principles and research-informed teaching practices. Under Boaler's leadership, youcubed has become an influential force in mathematics education, reaching millions of educators and students worldwide through online courses, resources, and professional development programmes.

Youcubed's mission centres on inspiring all students with what Boaler terms "open, creative, mindset mathematics." The organisation draws from neuroscience and mathematics education research to create accessible resources designed by a team with real classroom experience. Through online courses, in-person professional learning, books, and a wide variety of free web-based tasks and videos, youcubed demonstrates how to teach mathematics in ways that are creative, visual, and engaging rather than rigid, procedural, and anxiety-inducing.

The centre's reach has been substantial. Boaler taught the first Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) on mathematics education through youcubed, enrolling over 40,000 participants. The organisation's resources are now used by educators across more than 140 countries, making Boaler's influence genuinely global in scope.

## Mathematical Mindsets: Core Principles

Boaler's most influential work, *Mathematical Mindsets: Unleashing Students' Potential through Creative Math, Inspiring Messages and Innovative Teaching* (first published 2016, second edition 2022), presents a comprehensive blueprint for banishing mathematics anxiety and laying foundations for mathematical success accessible to all learners. The book synthesises decades of research into practical classroom strategies grounded in what Boaler terms "mathematical mindsets."

### The Problem of Fixed Mindsets in Mathematics

Boaler identifies fixed mindset beliefs as particularly damaging in mathematics education. Unlike other subjects, mathematics is often perceived as a domain where ability is innate—some students are "maths people" while others are not. This belief, Boaler argues, is both scientifically incorrect and educationally harmful. Drawing on the work of Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck on growth mindset, Boaler demonstrates how beliefs about the nature of mathematical ability profoundly shape students' learning trajectories.

Students with fixed mindsets tend to avoid challenges, give up easily when encountering difficulties, and see effort as evidence of low ability. In contrast, students with growth mindsets embrace challenges, persist through setbacks, and understand that effort develops ability. Boaler's research has shown that these mindset differences predict mathematics achievement more powerfully than prior attainment or measured ability.

### Transforming Classroom Messages

Central to Boaler's approach is the transformation of messages that students receive about mathematics learning. Traditional mathematics classrooms often communicate—explicitly or implicitly—that mathematics is about speed, memorisation, and following procedures. Boaler advocates replacing these messages with alternative framings that emphasise:

- **Depth over speed:** Mathematical thinking benefits from careful consideration rather than rapid calculation. Boaler's research demonstrates that students who approach problems thoughtfully often achieve deeper understanding than those who rush to answers.

- **Struggle as productive:** Encountering difficulty is not evidence of inability but an essential part of the learning process. Boaler encourages teachers to normalise struggle and frame challenges as opportunities for brain growth.

- **Multiple approaches:** There are often many valid ways to solve mathematical problems. Classrooms should celebrate this diversity of thinking rather than privileging a single "correct" method.

- **Creativity and flexibility:** Mathematics is fundamentally a creative subject involving pattern recognition, conjecture, and reasoning—not merely the mechanical application of algorithms.

## Fluency Without Fear: Rethinking Memorisation

One of Boaler's most controversial yet research-grounded positions concerns the teaching of number facts and fluency. In her influential paper "Fluency Without Fear," co-authored with youcubed colleagues, Boaler presents evidence that traditional approaches to developing fluency—particularly timed testing and rote memorisation—often undermine the very learning they aim to promote.

### The Problems with Timed Testing

Boaler's research highlights the damaging effects of timed mathematics tests on student anxiety and long-term learning. When students experience time pressure, their working memory becomes compromised, making it difficult to access facts they actually know. More seriously, timed tests communicate that mathematics is about speed rather than understanding, and that performance under pressure matters more than conceptual grasp.

For students who experience mathematics anxiety—and Boaler's research suggests this includes a significant proportion of the population—timed testing can trigger panic responses that effectively shut down mathematical thinking. The anxiety produced by such testing can persist into adulthood, contributing to the widespread phenomenon of adults who avoid mathematics despite being capable of learning it.

### Developing Number Sense

Rather than memorisation through repetition and testing, Boaler advocates developing what she terms "number sense"—a deep, flexible understanding of how numbers relate to one another and how operations transform quantities. Students with strong number sense can derive unknown facts from known ones, estimate reasonably, and recognise when answers are implausible.

Boaler argues that the best way to develop fluency with numbers is to develop number sense and to work with numbers in different ways, not to blindly memorise without understanding. For example, a student who understands that 6 × 7 can be thought of as (5 × 7) + 7 or (6 × 5) + (6 × 2) has developed number sense that will serve them better than mere recall of the fact 42.

### Visual and Conceptual Approaches to Facts

Youcubed resources emphasise visual and conceptual approaches to developing number facts. Rather than abstract drills, students engage with concrete materials, visual representations, and pattern-seeking activities that build conceptual understanding alongside procedural fluency. Research cited by Boaler suggests that these approaches produce more robust and transferable learning than rote memorisation alone.

## Visual Mathematics and Brain Research

Boaler's recent work has increasingly drawn on neuroscience to support her pedagogical recommendations. In particular, she highlights research showing that visual thinking plays a fundamental role in mathematical cognition—challenging traditional views that emphasise symbolic manipulation as the essence of mathematical thinking.

### The Importance of Visual Pathways

Neuroscience research cited by Boaler demonstrates that when people work on mathematics problems, brain activity is distributed across multiple regions, including visual processing areas. This suggests that visual thinking is not merely a support for mathematical learning but integral to mathematical cognition itself.

The implications of this finding are profound for mathematics teaching. Learning formal abstract mathematics is enhanced when students are using visual and intuitive mathematical thinking. Boaler argues that classrooms should routinely incorporate visual representations, concrete materials, and spatial reasoning activities alongside symbolic work.

### Connecting Visual and Symbolic Understanding

Youcubed resources consistently emphasise connections between visual representations and symbolic mathematics. Rather than treating manipulatives and diagrams as merely introductory scaffolding to be abandoned once formal procedures are learned, Boaler advocates maintaining these connections throughout mathematical development.

For example, when learning multiplication, students might work with arrays of objects, area models, number lines, and symbolic notation—developing understanding that connects across these representations. This multi-representational approach builds more robust and flexible knowledge than symbolic work alone.

## Ability Grouping and Educational Equity

Throughout her career, Boaler has been a prominent critic of ability grouping (often called "setting" in the UK context) in mathematics education. Her research has consistently demonstrated that grouping students by perceived ability tends to exacerbate inequality while failing to improve overall achievement.

### Research on Ability Grouping Effects

Boaler's early research in the UK compared mathematics teaching in schools with different grouping practices. In a landmark study with Dylan Wiliam and Margaret Brown, she tracked students in schools that set students by ability against those in mixed-ability settings. The research found that students in mixed-ability settings achieved higher overall attainment while reducing the achievement gaps between students from different social backgrounds.

The negative effects of ability grouping are particularly pronounced for students placed in lower sets. Boaler's research documents how such placement often leads to disaffection, limited curriculum exposure, and self-fulfilling prophecies of low achievement. Students in lower sets receive qualitatively different teaching—more procedural, less challenging, less engaging—that constrains their mathematical development regardless of their initial capabilities.

### The Social Class Dimension

Boaler has highlighted the relationship between ability grouping and social class. In the UK context, working-class students are disproportionately placed in lower sets, while middle-class students cluster in higher sets. This pattern means that ability grouping functions as a mechanism for reproducing social inequality, channelling students from disadvantaged backgrounds into educational trajectories that limit their future opportunities.

Her research paper "Ability and Mathematics: The Mindset Revolution that Is Reshaping Education" reviews evidence for brain plasticity and the importance of mindset, arguing that fixed-ability thinking is scientifically outdated and educationally harmful. Rather than sorting students based on perceived fixed ability, Boaler advocates teaching approaches that assume all students can develop mathematical competence given appropriate support and opportunities.

## Complex Instruction and Collaborative Learning

Boaler's research has examined pedagogical approaches that support high achievement in heterogeneous classrooms. In particular, she has studied and promoted Complex Instruction—a pedagogical model developed at Stanford that enables all students to work on challenging tasks in mixed-ability collaborative groups.

### Principles of Complex Instruction

Complex Instruction is designed to counteract the status differences that often emerge in group work, where some students dominate while others remain marginal. The model employs specific strategies to ensure that all students participate meaningfully and that contributions from all group members are valued.

Key elements include:

- **Group-worthy tasks:** Activities designed to require genuine collaboration, with no single student able to complete the work alone.

- **Multiple ability treatment:** Explicit framing that successful task completion requires multiple abilities—mathematical, communicative, creative, organisational—so that different students can contribute in different ways.

- **Individual accountability:** Mechanisms ensuring that all group members must understand and can explain the group's work, not merely contribute a portion.

- **Status interventions:** Strategies for raising the status of students who might otherwise be marginalised, including assigning competence publicly and rotating roles.

Boaler's research has demonstrated that Complex Instruction can produce dramatic improvements in student learning, particularly for students previously placed in lower tracks.

## Open, Creative Mathematics

Central to Boaler's vision is a conception of mathematics as an open, creative subject rather than a closed set of procedures to be memorised. This perspective has profound implications for curriculum design, task selection, and classroom culture.

### Low Floor, High Ceiling Tasks

Youcubed promotes what Boaler terms "low floor, high ceiling" tasks—mathematical activities accessible to all students (low floor) while offering opportunities for deep exploration and extension (high ceiling). Such tasks allow all students to engage productively while enabling those ready for greater challenge to pursue more sophisticated mathematical ideas.

Examples include pattern-seeking activities, open-ended investigations, and "what if" questions that invite conjecture and exploration. These tasks stand in contrast to traditional exercises with single correct answers and prescribed solution methods.

### Encouraging Mathematical Thinking

Boaler emphasises that mathematical thinking involves conjecture, reasoning, generalisation, and proof—not merely calculation. Classrooms should provide regular opportunities for students to engage in these thinking processes, developing their capacity to reason mathematically rather than merely execute procedures.

This emphasis on thinking extends to how errors and misconceptions are treated. Rather than errors being embarrassing failures to be avoided, Boaler advocates classroom cultures where mistakes are welcomed as opportunities for learning. Her research suggests that the brain grows most when learners encounter and work through difficulties, making the handling of errors a crucial pedagogical moment.

## Critiques and Controversies

Boaler's work has not been without controversy. Her positions on memorisation, timed testing, and ability grouping have attracted criticism from some mathematicians and educators who argue that she underestimates the importance of fluency and practice in mathematical development.

### The Memorisation Debate

Critics have sometimes misrepresented Boaler as opposed to all memorisation in mathematics. In fact, her position is more nuanced: she argues that memorisation should follow from understanding rather than replace it, and that stress-inducing timed testing is counterproductive. She acknowledges the importance of automaticity with number facts but argues this is best developed through number sense and conceptual understanding rather than rote repetition.

The 2015 announcement by the UK Education Secretary that all students should memorise times tables up to 12 × 12 by age 9 sparked particular debate. Boaler critiqued this requirement not because she opposes times tables knowledge, but because she questioned whether mandated memorisation by a specific age—assessed through timed testing—represents sound educational practice.

### Research Methodology Questions

Some critics have raised questions about the methodology of Boaler's early research, particularly the study comparing schools with different grouping practices. Boaler has defended her research against these critiques, and her broader findings about ability grouping align with substantial research literatures internationally. Nevertheless, these controversies illustrate the contested nature of mathematics education research and the strong feelings that debates about teaching methods can provoke.

### Navigating Evidence and Ideology

Boaler herself has argued that resistance to her recommendations often reflects ideological commitment to traditional mathematics teaching rather than engagement with research evidence. She points to the substantial body of research supporting inquiry-based learning, growth mindset interventions, and heterogeneous grouping—suggesting that critiques often come from those whose own mathematics learning followed traditional patterns and who assume these patterns represent the only valid approach.

## Impact on Policy and Practice

Despite controversies, Boaler's influence on mathematics education has been substantial and growing. Her work has informed policy discussions in the UK, US, and internationally, and her practical resources are used by millions of teachers worldwide.

### UK Influence

In the UK, Boaler's research on ability grouping has contributed to ongoing debates about setting practices in secondary mathematics. Her finding that mixed-ability teaching can produce higher overall attainment while reducing inequality has informed discussions about comprehensive education and educational equity. While ability grouping remains widespread in UK mathematics teaching, Boaler's research provides an evidence base for those seeking alternatives.

Boaler's critique of timed testing has also influenced discussions about assessment practices. While high-stakes testing remains central to UK education policy, her research on the anxiety-producing effects of timed assessment has contributed to growing interest in alternative assessment approaches that support rather than undermine learning.

### US and Global Reach

In the United States, Boaler's work has informed the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics, particularly the emphasis on conceptual understanding, multiple representations, and mathematical practices alongside content knowledge. Her research on growth mindset has been widely adopted by US educators, contributing to a broader movement toward social-emotional learning and non-cognitive skill development.

Globally, youcubed's online courses and free resources have reached educators in over 140 countries. The organisation's materials have been translated into multiple languages, and Boaler's books are available worldwide. This global reach makes Boaler one of the most influential mathematics educators of her generation.

## Implications for Classroom Practice

Boaler's research offers numerous practical implications for mathematics teachers seeking to implement her recommendations:

### Transforming Classroom Culture

- **Normalize struggle:** Frame difficulty as an expected and valuable part of learning rather than evidence of deficiency.
- **Value multiple approaches:** Celebrate the diversity of thinking that emerges when students approach problems in different ways.
- **Welcome mistakes:** Create classroom cultures where errors are treated as opportunities for learning rather than embarrassing failures.
- **Replace speed with depth:** Emphasise thorough thinking over rapid completion.

### Task Design and Selection

- **Choose low floor, high ceiling tasks:** Select activities accessible to all while offering extension possibilities.
- **Include visual and concrete components:** Ensure students regularly work with manipulatives, diagrams, and spatial representations.
- **Prioritise open-ended exploration:** Include tasks with multiple valid approaches and no single "correct" method.
- **Connect to real contexts:** Ground mathematics in meaningful situations that demonstrate its relevance and utility.

### Assessment and Feedback

- **Minimise timed testing:** Reduce or eliminate timed assessments that produce anxiety and undermine learning.
- **Assess understanding not recall:** Focus assessment on conceptual grasp and flexible application rather than memorised procedures.
- **Provide growth-oriented feedback:** Comment on effort, strategy, and improvement rather than innate ability.
- **Use formative approaches:** Employ assessment primarily to inform teaching rather than to rank students.

### Grouping and Differentiation

- **Consider mixed-ability settings:** Evaluate whether ability grouping serves students' learning or merely sorts them into predetermined tracks.
- **Use Complex Instruction strategies:** Implement the pedagogical approaches that enable successful heterogeneous collaboration.
- **Differentiate through task not pathway:** Provide challenge and support within shared activities rather than through separate curricula for different "ability" groups.

## Relationship to Other Key Thinkers

Boaler's work connects to several other influential figures in mathematics education:

### Carol Dweck
Boaler's application of growth mindset to mathematics builds directly on the research of Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck. While Dweck's work addresses mindset across domains, Boaler has been instrumental in showing how mindset principles apply specifically to mathematics and in developing practical classroom strategies based on these principles.

### Dylan Wiliam
Boaler collaborated with assessment expert Dylan Wiliam on influential research into ability grouping. Wiliam's work on formative assessment complements Boaler's recommendations, with both scholars emphasising classroom practices that support all students' learning rather than merely sorting students by performance.

### John Hattie
Boaler's research on visible learning and effective teaching practices aligns with John Hattie's meta-analytic work, though the two scholars differ in emphasis. Where Hattie focuses broadly on effect sizes across educational interventions, Boaler provides more specific guidance on mathematics pedagogy grounded in her research programme.

### Richard Skemp
Boaler's distinction between instrumental and relational understanding connects to the earlier work of Richard Skemp, who similarly argued that conceptual understanding produces more robust learning than procedural fluency alone. Boaler extends this insight with contemporary research on brain plasticity and mindset.

## Future Directions

Boaler's work continues to evolve. Recent developments include:

**Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics Learning:** Boaler has begun exploring how AI tools might support mathematics education, particularly in providing personalised feedback and enabling students to explore mathematical ideas in new ways.

**Data Science Education:** Recognising the growing importance of data literacy, youcubed has developed resources for teaching data science concepts across the curriculum, connecting traditional mathematics to emerging disciplinary needs.

**Neuroscience Integration:** Boaler continues to draw on neuroscience research to inform pedagogical recommendations, translating findings about brain plasticity, anxiety, and cognition into practical classroom guidance.

**Equity and Social Justice:** Increasingly, Boaler frames her work in terms of educational equity and social justice, arguing that traditional mathematics education functions to reproduce social inequality while alternative approaches can disrupt these patterns.
