# Mark McCourt: A Profile

Mark McCourt stands as one of the most influential figures in UK mathematics education over the past three decades. His career trajectory—from classroom teacher to headteacher, Ofsted inspector, government advisor, and entrepreneur—has given him a uniquely comprehensive perspective on the teaching and learning of mathematics. As the UK's leading authority on teaching for mastery, founder of La Salle Education and Complete Mathematics, creator of emaths, and founding chairman of the Teacher Development Trust, McCourt has shaped mathematics education at every level from individual classroom practice to national policy. His work has trained over 2,000 schools in mastery models and has reached mathematics teachers across the UK and overseas, establishing him as a pivotal figure in the ongoing evolution of mathematics pedagogy.

## Biography and Career Trajectory

### Early Career and Classroom Roots

McCourt's career in education began in the classroom, where he established himself as a mathematics teacher of considerable skill and insight. His early experiences teaching mathematics provided the foundation for his subsequent contributions to the field, grounding his later theoretical work in practical classroom reality. Unlike many who move from classroom to policy or consultancy work, McCourt has maintained throughout his career a deep connection to the realities of teaching mathematics, frequently emphasising the importance of staying connected to actual classroom practice.

His progression through various roles in schools—Advanced Skills Teacher (AST), Head of Department, Senior Leader—gave him progressively broader perspectives on how mathematics education functions within the institutional context of schools. These experiences informed his later work on teacher development and school improvement, as he understood from direct experience the challenges and opportunities facing mathematics departments and their leaders.

### Headship and Leadership

McCourt's appointment as a headteacher marked a significant phase in his career, providing him with executive responsibility for whole-school outcomes and the strategic direction of educational provision. During his headship, he developed the leadership perspectives that would later inform his work with the Teacher Development Trust and his consultancy with schools across the country. Headship also gave him insight into the challenges of implementing change at scale within schools, experience that would prove valuable in his later work training thousands of schools in mastery approaches.

The transition from headship to other roles was driven by McCourt's recognition that his skills and perspectives could have broader impact beyond a single school. However, he has consistently maintained that his headship experience remains central to his understanding of education, frequently referencing the lessons learned during this period in his writing and speaking.

### Ofsted Inspection and Quality Assurance

McCourt's appointment as an Ofsted inspector added another dimension to his expertise, providing him with systematic experience of evaluating teaching quality across a wide range of schools and contexts. This work exposed him to the full spectrum of mathematics teaching practice in English schools, from exemplary to inadequate, and developed his capacity for making evaluative judgements about teaching quality.

His Ofsted experience has informed his later work in several important ways. First, it provided him with a comprehensive view of the state of mathematics education across the country, helping him identify common patterns of strength and weakness. Second, it developed his understanding of how inspection frameworks interact with classroom practice, insights that have informed his critiques of assessment and accountability systems. Third, it established his credibility as an evaluator of teaching quality, an important foundation for his subsequent work in teacher training and development.

McCourt has been critical of aspects of the inspection regime while maintaining respect for the importance of external quality assurance. His critiques have focused on the unintended consequences of high-stakes accountability, particularly the ways in which inspection frameworks can distort classroom practice when schools prioritise compliance over genuine educational excellence.

### NCETM and National Policy

McCourt's appointment as Director at the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics (NCETM) positioned him at the heart of national mathematics education policy. The NCETM, established in 2006, plays a central role in coordinating professional development for mathematics teachers and promoting evidence-informed practice across England. As a senior director at the organisation, McCourt was instrumental in shaping its programmes and strategic direction.

His work at the NCETM coincided with growing interest in East Asian mathematics education models, particularly the approaches developed in Singapore and Shanghai that would later influence the English teaching for mastery programme. McCourt's engagement with these models during his NCETM tenure provided the foundation for his later mastery work, as he developed deep understanding of the principles underlying successful mathematics teaching in high-performing jurisdictions.

The NCETM role also developed McCourt's capacity for working at scale, coordinating professional development provision for thousands of teachers across the country. This experience proved invaluable when he later established his own organisations designed to reach similar scales of impact.

### Teacher Development Trust

In 2012, McCourt founded the Teacher Development Trust, serving as its founding Chairman. The Trust was established with a clear mission: to improve the quality of teacher professional development in England, based on the recognition that teacher learning is the key driver of pupil learning. Under McCourt's leadership, the Trust developed frameworks and tools for evaluating and improving professional development provision, drawing on international research evidence about effective teacher learning.

The Teacher Development Trust's work has been influential in shifting professional discourse about teacher development in England, moving conversations away from generic "training days" toward more sophisticated understandings of ongoing professional learning. The Trust's Developing Great Teaching report (2015), produced in collaboration with the Institute for Effective Education, provided important evidence about what makes professional development effective, informing both policy and practice.

McCourt's chairmanship of the Trust demonstrated his commitment to system-level improvement beyond the specific domain of mathematics education. While his primary expertise lies in mathematics, his work with the Teacher Development Trust addressed professional learning across all subjects, reflecting his broader commitment to educational excellence.

## La Salle Education and Complete Mathematics

### Founding Vision

In 2013, McCourt founded La Salle Education, the organisation through which he has pursued his most ambitious vision for mathematics education. The founding of La Salle represented McCourt's decision to create an independent vehicle for his educational mission, free from the constraints of government employment or institutional affiliation. The organisation's name references René La Salle, the 17th-century French explorer, reflecting McCourt's exploratory and ambitious approach to educational improvement.

La Salle Education was established with a clear and ambitious mission: to bring together mathematics teachers across the world and unite them in improving mathematics education for all pupils. This mission reflected McCourt's belief that collaboration and community are essential drivers of educational improvement, and that the isolation of individual teachers and departments represents a significant barrier to raising standards.

The organisation's initial focus was on professional development events, particularly the MathsConf series that has become a fixture of the mathematics education landscape. Over time, La Salle has expanded its portfolio to include Complete Mathematics, the comprehensive curriculum and professional development platform that represents McCourt's most significant contribution to mathematics education infrastructure.

### Complete Mathematics Platform

Complete Mathematics, launched by La Salle Education, represents McCourt's vision for a comprehensive, coherent approach to mathematics education. The platform combines curriculum resources, professional development, assessment tools, and teacher community in an integrated ecosystem designed to support excellence in mathematics teaching.

At the heart of Complete Mathematics is a comprehensive curriculum spanning early years to Key Stage 5, built on the principles of teaching for mastery and informed by McCourt's extensive experience of effective mathematics education. The curriculum is designed to be genuinely comprehensive, covering all the content that pupils need to learn in a carefully sequenced progression that builds conceptual understanding over time.

The platform's professional development components reflect McCourt's belief that curriculum resources alone are insufficient for educational improvement—teachers need ongoing learning opportunities to develop their pedagogical skill and subject knowledge. Complete Mathematics integrates professional development directly into the platform, providing teachers with the learning opportunities they need to implement the curriculum effectively.

Complete Mathematics also includes assessment tools aligned with the curriculum, enabling teachers to monitor pupil progress and identify areas where additional support or challenge is needed. The assessment system is designed to support teaching rather than merely measure outcomes, providing diagnostic information that informs instructional decisions.

### MathsConf

The MathsConf series, organised by La Salle Education, has become the largest mathematics teacher conference in the UK and a significant fixture in the professional calendar. MathsConf events bring together hundreds of mathematics teachers for a day of learning, networking, and professional inspiration. The conferences feature presentations from leading figures in mathematics education, workshops on practical classroom strategies, and opportunities for teachers to share their own practice.

McCourt's role in MathsConf extends beyond organisational logistics to encompass a deliberate philosophy of teacher professional community. The conferences are designed not merely as transmission opportunities where experts share knowledge with novices, but as genuine professional learning communities where teachers collaborate, challenge each other, and collectively develop their practice.

The success of MathsConf reflects McCourt's understanding of what motivates teachers to engage with professional development. Rather than relying on compulsion or performance management pressure, MathsConf creates conditions where teachers want to attend because they recognise genuine value for their practice. The conferences have maintained this appeal over multiple years, with events regularly selling out and attracting teachers from across the country.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, McCourt and La Salle Education demonstrated agility in adapting MathsConf to online formats, ensuring that mathematics teachers could continue accessing professional development despite restrictions on physical gatherings. This adaptation maintained professional community during a period of significant challenge for the teaching profession.

## Teaching for Mastery

### Conceptual Foundations

McCourt's book "Teaching for Mastery" (2019) represents his most comprehensive articulation of mastery approaches to mathematics education. The book draws on his extensive experience training schools in mastery models, as well as his research into successful mathematics education systems internationally. It establishes him as the UK's leading authority on teaching for mastery, a position reflected in the more than 2,000 schools he has trained in these approaches.

McCourt's conception of mastery is distinctive in several important respects. First, he emphasises that mastery is not a destination but a journey—pupils do not "achieve mastery" in a binary sense, but rather move progressively along a continuum of expertise. This perspective distinguishes his approach from superficial implementations that treat mastery as a checkbox to be ticked once particular content is covered.

Second, McCourt emphasises the infinite scope of mathematical ideas. He argues that any given mathematical concept can be explored at progressively deeper levels, meaning that the work of mastering mathematics never truly ends. This perspective has important implications for teaching, as it suggests that even pupils who have demonstrated competence with a concept can benefit from deeper exploration.

Third, McCourt's mastery approach is explicitly inclusive, predicated on the belief that all pupils can learn mathematics to high levels given appropriate teaching and sufficient time. This commitment to universal high achievement distinguishes mastery approaches from practices that accept differential achievement as inevitable, streaming pupils into different pathways based on perceived ability.

### Critique of Conventional Practice

McCourt's advocacy for mastery is built on a sustained critique of conventional mathematics teaching practice in England. He identifies several problematic patterns that mastery approaches are designed to address:

**The conveyor belt system:** McCourt critiques the predominant model of mathematics teaching as a "conveyor belt" where pupils are moved through content at a fixed pace regardless of whether they have securely learned prerequisite material. In this model, pupils who have not fully understood a topic are nevertheless moved on to the next, with the result that gaps in understanding accumulate over time.

**Ability grouping:** McCourt is a prominent critic of ability grouping in mathematics, arguing that it creates self-fulfilling prophecies where pupils placed in lower groups receive less demanding teaching and consequently make less progress. He advocates for mixed-attainment teaching as a core component of mastery approaches, ensuring that all pupils have access to the same high-quality mathematical content.

**Surface-level coverage:** McCourt argues that conventional practice often prioritises coverage of content over depth of understanding, with teachers feeling pressure to move through material quickly in order to cover everything that will be examined. Mastery approaches deliberately slow down the pace of teaching to ensure that pupils develop deep, connected understanding of mathematical concepts.

**Task design:** McCourt has been critical of the quality of mathematical tasks commonly used in classrooms, arguing that many tasks fail to develop the deep conceptual understanding that characterises mathematical expertise. His work on task design, particularly in collaboration with Chris McGrane, addresses this critique directly.

### Practical Implementation

McCourt's mastery work extends beyond theoretical articulation to encompass practical guidance for implementation. His training programmes for schools address the concrete changes in practice that mastery approaches require, from curriculum sequencing to task design to assessment strategies.

Central to implementation is the shift from a focus on teaching to a focus on learning. McCourt emphasises that the key question for teachers is not "Have I taught this?" but "Have pupils learned this?" This shift in focus has implications for lesson design, with teachers required to build in opportunities for checking understanding and responding to gaps or misconceptions.

The implementation of mastery also requires significant investment in teacher subject knowledge. McCourt argues that teaching for mastery requires teachers to understand mathematics at a depth beyond that required for mere procedural competence, enabling them to represent concepts in multiple ways and to anticipate and address pupil misconceptions. This emphasis on subject knowledge development is a consistent theme throughout his work.

Assessment practices must also change under mastery approaches. McCourt advocates for assessment that supports learning rather than merely measuring it, with regular low-stakes checking of understanding informing instructional decisions. He is critical of high-stakes testing regimes that distort teaching practice, while recognising the importance of valid assessment information for monitoring pupil progress.

## Mathematical Tasks: The Bridge Between Teaching and Learning

### Collaborative Work with Chris McGrane

In 2020, McCourt published "Mathematical Tasks: The Bridge Between Teaching and Learning" in collaboration with Chris McGrane. The book represents a significant contribution to the literature on task design in mathematics education, offering practical guidance for teachers on creating and using tasks that lead to deep mathematical learning.

The book's central argument is that tasks are the fundamental unit of mathematics teaching—the means through which curriculum intentions are realised in classroom practice. McCourt and McGrane argue that the quality of mathematical tasks is the primary determinant of the quality of mathematical learning, making task design a critical skill for mathematics teachers.

The collaboration with McGrane brought together complementary expertise. McCourt's system-level perspective and experience of training schools in mastery approaches combined with McGrane's deep classroom expertise and innovative task design to produce a book that is both theoretically grounded and practically applicable.

### Principles of Task Design

The book articulates several principles for effective task design that reflect McCourt's broader philosophy of mathematics education:

**Variation theory:** Tasks should be designed using principles of variation, with careful attention to what changes and what stays the same across examples. This approach, drawn from the work of Ference Marton and developed in East Asian mathematics education, helps pupils discern the essential features of mathematical concepts by experiencing carefully designed patterns of variation.

**Intelligent practice:** McCourt advocates for "intelligent practice" rather than mere repetition. Practice tasks should be designed to develop fluency while also deepening conceptual understanding, with each question building on previous ones in ways that develop mathematical thinking.

**Problem solving:** Tasks should provide opportunities for genuine problem solving, not merely routine application of procedures. McCourt emphasises the importance of pupils experiencing the struggle and satisfaction of solving unfamiliar problems, developing the resilience and creativity that characterise mathematical expertise.

**Accessibility and challenge:** Tasks should be designed to be simultaneously accessible to all pupils and challenging for all pupils. This apparent paradox is resolved through what McCourt terms "low threshold, high ceiling" tasks—activities that all pupils can begin but that offer scope for exploration at increasing levels of sophistication.

### Task Types and Examples

The book provides detailed exploration of various task types, with examples and commentary on their use. These include:

**Example-problem pairs:** Tasks that present a worked example alongside a similar problem for pupils to solve, supporting the development of procedural fluency while building understanding of underlying mathematical structures.

**Practice sequences:** Carefully designed sequences of practice questions that develop fluency while also revealing mathematical patterns and relationships.

**Problem-solving tasks:** Open-ended problems that require pupils to apply mathematical thinking in unfamiliar contexts, developing the capacity for independent mathematical reasoning.

**Exploratory tasks:** Activities that invite pupils to investigate mathematical situations and discover patterns for themselves, developing mathematical curiosity and independence.

Each task type is illustrated with concrete examples drawn from across the mathematics curriculum, making the book immediately useful for teachers planning their lessons.

## Pedagogical Philosophy

### Belief in All Pupils' Mathematical Potential

A consistent theme throughout McCourt's work is his fundamental belief that all pupils can learn mathematics to high levels. This conviction, which runs counter to the widespread acceptance of mathematical ability as fixed and distributed, underpins his advocacy for mastery approaches and mixed-attainment teaching.

McCourt argues that the apparent differences in mathematical achievement that are typically attributed to innate ability are in fact largely the result of differences in teaching quality, curriculum access, and time for learning. When these variables are controlled, he suggests, the vast majority of pupils can achieve mastery of mathematical content.

This belief is not merely aspirational but is supported by evidence from high-performing jurisdictions where the expectation of universal mathematical achievement is the norm. McCourt's work frequently references these international comparisons, using them to challenge the deficit assumptions that characterise much English educational discourse.

### The Centrality of Subject Knowledge

McCourt places teacher subject knowledge at the centre of his pedagogical philosophy, arguing that deep mathematical understanding is a prerequisite for effective teaching. This emphasis distinguishes his work from approaches that focus primarily on generic teaching skills or pedagogical techniques.

The subject knowledge McCourt advocates goes beyond procedural competence to encompass the deep, connected understanding that enables teachers to explain concepts in multiple ways, to anticipate and address misconceptions, and to make connections between different areas of mathematics. He argues that teachers who lack this depth of understanding are limited in their capacity to develop deep understanding in their pupils.

This philosophy has informed the design of Complete Mathematics, which includes extensive subject knowledge development materials for teachers. It also underpins McCourt's critique of approaches that rely on non-specialist teachers or that assume that general pedagogical skills can compensate for subject-specific weakness.

### The Importance of Professional Community

McCourt's work consistently emphasises the importance of professional community for teacher development. From the Teacher Development Trust through to MathsConf and Complete Mathematics, he has created structures and spaces that enable mathematics teachers to learn from each other and collectively develop their practice.

This emphasis on community reflects McCourt's understanding of teaching as a complex, intellectually demanding profession that cannot be mastered in isolation. Teachers need access to the collective wisdom of the profession, opportunities to discuss challenges and share solutions, and relationships with colleagues who can support their ongoing development.

The professional communities McCourt has created are characterised by genuine collaboration rather than hierarchical transmission. While he is undoubtedly a figure of authority in mathematics education, his approach to community building emphasises mutual learning and the recognition that all teachers have something to contribute.

### Formal Language and Mathematical Literacy

McCourt has developed distinctive views on the role of language in mathematics education, advocating for the use of formal mathematical language from the earliest stages of education. He argues that pupils should be taught correct mathematical terminology and notation from the outset, rather than being introduced to informal language that must later be unlearned.

This emphasis on formal language connects to McCourt's broader concept of "mathematical literacy"—the ability to read, write, and speak mathematics with precision and fluency. He argues that mathematical literacy is as important as numerical proficiency, and that pupils who cannot express mathematical ideas in formal language are limited in their mathematical development.

The emphasis on formal language has implications for classroom practice, requiring teachers to model precise mathematical expression and to correct pupils' informal or imprecise language. McCourt argues that this attention to language is particularly important for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, who may have less exposure to formal registers in their home environments.

## Influence and Legacy

### Impact on National Policy

McCourt's influence on mathematics education extends to national policy, shaped through his work at the NCETM, his advisory roles, and his public advocacy. The teaching for mastery programme that has been rolled out nationally by the Department for Education reflects principles that McCourt has long advocated, though he has maintained an independent voice that is not uncritically aligned with government policy.

His influence is particularly evident in the growing acceptance of mixed-attainment teaching in mathematics, the increased attention to curriculum coherence and sequencing, and the recognition of the importance of teacher subject knowledge. While these developments cannot be attributed solely to McCourt, his persistent advocacy has helped shift professional and policy discourse in these directions.

McCourt has also influenced policy through his critiques of existing arrangements, particularly regarding assessment and accountability. His arguments about the distorting effects of high-stakes testing have contributed to broader debates about how mathematics achievement should be measured and reported.

### Contribution to Professional Knowledge

Through his books, conference presentations, blog posts, and training programmes, McCourt has made substantial contributions to the professional knowledge base for mathematics teaching. His work synthesises research evidence, practical experience, and international perspectives into guidance that teachers can apply in their classrooms.

The accessibility of McCourt's writing and speaking—his ability to communicate complex ideas in clear, direct language—has enabled him to reach audiences beyond the academic community. Teachers who might not engage with research literature directly can access important ideas through McCourt's mediation, making his work a significant vehicle for research dissemination.

The practical focus of McCourt's work ensures that it addresses the real challenges teachers face. While he engages with theoretical perspectives and research evidence, his work is consistently oriented toward practical improvement—what teachers can do differently on Monday morning to improve their pupils' mathematical learning.

### Development of Educational Infrastructure

Perhaps McCourt's most significant legacy lies in the educational infrastructure he has created. Complete Mathematics provides a comprehensive platform that supports mathematics teaching across the country, while MathsConf has established a sustainable model for professional development events. These organisations will continue to influence mathematics education long after McCourt's personal involvement has ended.

The infrastructure McCourt has created is distinctive in its combination of commercial sustainability and educational mission. Unlike some commercial providers whose primary goal is profit, or some educational charities whose lack of commercial acumen limits their reach, McCourt has built organisations that are both financially viable and genuinely committed to educational improvement.

The model of professional development represented by MathsConf and Complete Mathematics has influenced the broader landscape of teacher development, demonstrating that effective professional learning can be engaging, collaborative, and teacher-led rather than imposed and compliance-focused.

## Critiques and Debates

### Debates About Mastery

While McCourt is widely respected, his advocacy for mastery has not been without controversy. Some critics have questioned whether East Asian approaches can be successfully transplanted to English contexts, given cultural and systemic differences. McCourt has responded to these critiques by emphasising the principles underlying successful mathematics teaching rather than surface features of particular systems.

Debates have also occurred about the pace of implementation of mastery approaches, with some arguing that the Department for Education's mastery programme has been too rapid or too prescriptive. McCourt has maintained an independent position on these questions, supporting the principles of mastery while critiquing particular implementation decisions.

The question of mixed-attainment teaching remains contentious, with some teachers and researchers arguing that ability grouping has benefits that mastery advocates understate. McCourt has engaged substantively with these critiques, acknowledging the challenges of mixed-attainment teaching while maintaining that the benefits outweigh the costs.

### Relationship with Education Establishment

McCourt's outspokenness has sometimes put him at odds with elements of the education establishment. His critiques of Ofsted, examination boards, and government policy have been sharp, even as he has worked constructively with these organisations at various points in his career.

This willingness to criticise powerful institutions reflects McCourt's commitment to what he sees as the best interests of mathematics education, even when this requires uncomfortable truths. Teachers and school leaders who have worked with him report that he combines this critical stance with practical support for navigating the systems as they exist.

McCourt's retirement from executive roles at La Salle Education in 2023 marked a transition in his relationship with the educational establishment, potentially freeing him to be even more outspoken in his commentary on education policy and practice.

### Commercial Dimensions

The commercial success of La Salle Education and Complete Mathematics has occasionally prompted questions about the relationship between commercial interests and educational mission. Critics have questioned whether the subscription model of Complete Mathematics creates barriers to access, or whether the prominence of La Salle in the professional development market crowds out other providers.

McCourt and his organisations have responded to these questions by pointing to the affordability of their provision relative to alternatives, the quality of what they offer, and the investment of profits in further educational development. The free resources provided through emaths and the accessibility of MathsConf events support the argument that commercial success has not come at the expense of educational mission.

## Retirement and Continuing Influence

### 2023 Retirement

McCourt announced his retirement from executive roles at La Salle Education in 2023, concluding a decade of leadership at the organisation he founded. The retirement marked the end of a significant chapter in UK mathematics education, though McCourt has indicated that he will continue to be involved in education through writing, speaking, and advisory roles.

The transition at La Salle Education has been managed to ensure organisational continuity, with structures and leadership in place to maintain the work McCourt established. The sustainability of the organisations he created is an important part of his legacy, demonstrating that educational impact need not depend on the continued presence of a charismatic founder.

### Ongoing Contributions

Despite retirement from executive roles, McCourt continues to contribute to mathematics education through various channels. His blog, The Emaths Blog, remains active, providing commentary on educational issues and practical teaching ideas. He continues to speak at conferences and events, sharing his perspectives with mathematics teachers across the country.

McCourt's writing continues to influence the field, with his books remaining important resources for teacher development. The ideas he has articulated continue to shape professional development programmes, curriculum design, and classroom practice across the country.

The network of mathematics teachers who have been influenced by McCourt's work represents a lasting form of impact—practitioners whose teaching has been shaped by his ideas and who in turn influence the practice of colleagues in their schools and beyond.

## Implications for Teacher Development

### Subject Knowledge Development

McCourt's work has significant implications for how teacher subject knowledge is developed. His emphasis on deep mathematical understanding as a prerequisite for effective teaching challenges approaches to professional development that focus primarily on pedagogy or that treat subject knowledge as static once initial teacher education is complete.

The Complete Mathematics platform embodies McCourt's approach to subject knowledge development, providing teachers with accessible opportunities to deepen their mathematical understanding. The integration of subject knowledge development with curriculum resources reflects McCourt's view that these dimensions of teacher expertise cannot be separated.

For school leaders, McCourt's work provides guidance on prioritising and resourcing teacher subject knowledge development. His arguments about the centrality of subject knowledge support investment in professional development that develops teachers' mathematical understanding, even when this requires significant time and resources.

### Professional Learning Communities

McCourt's work demonstrates the value of professional learning communities for teacher development. The communities he has created through MathsConf and Complete Mathematics provide models for how such communities can be sustained and how they can contribute to professional learning.

For schools and departments, McCourt's work suggests the importance of creating collaborative cultures where teachers learn from each other. The isolation that characterises much teaching practice can be challenged through structures that enable sharing of practice, collaborative planning, and mutual observation.

The online dimensions of McCourt's work also demonstrate how technology can support professional community, enabling teachers to connect and learn beyond the physical boundaries of their schools. The Complete Mathematics platform provides a model for how online environments can support sustained professional learning.

### Implementation of Change

McCourt's extensive experience training schools in mastery approaches provides lessons for how educational change can be successfully implemented. His work emphasises the importance of professional development, time for implementation, and ongoing support during the change process.

For schools implementing mastery or other significant changes, McCourt's work highlights the importance of understanding the underlying principles rather than merely copying surface features. Sustainable change requires deep shifts in practice that are informed by understanding of why particular approaches are effective.

The scale of McCourt's mastery training—over 2,000 schools—demonstrates that significant change is possible at scale when the right conditions are in place. This provides encouragement for those seeking to implement ambitious change programmes, while also highlighting the resources and commitment required.
