## Biography and Career Overview

Malcolm Swan joined the Shell Centre for Mathematical Education at the University of Nottingham in 1979, having previously worked as a classroom teacher. The Shell Centre was a unique research and development centre focused on improving mathematics education through practical, classroom-tested materials. Swan remained at Nottingham for the entirety of his career, becoming a Professor and leading numerous international research and development projects until his death in 2017 at the age of 64.

Swan's work was characterised by a deep commitment to bridging the gap between research and practice. Rather than producing theoretical papers divorced from classroom realities, he dedicated his career to designing practical materials that embodied research findings about how students learn mathematics. His designs were always tested in real classrooms, refined through iterative development, and structured to support teachers in implementing research-informed approaches.

## Core Philosophy: Teaching for Conceptual Understanding

### From Transmission to Collaborative Inquiry

Swan's work represented a fundamental shift from traditional transmission-based approaches to mathematics teaching. In his seminal paper "A Designer Speaks" (Educational Designer, 2008), Swan articulated the principles that guided his design work, emphasising the importance of rich, collaborative tasks that engage students actively in mathematical thinking.

Swan argued that teaching for conceptual understanding is most effective when:

- **Tasks are rich and collaborative**: Activities should be accessible yet extendable, encourage decision-making, promote discussion, and foster creativity. Swan frequently cited the work of Ahmed (1987) on encouraging "what if?" and "what if not?" questions as central to mathematical exploration.

- **Multiple representations are used**: Mathematical concepts should be presented and connected through various representations—symbolic, visual, verbal, and contextual—to build robust understanding.

- **Students engage with misconceptions**: Rather than avoiding errors, effective teaching brings misconceptions to the surface and creates opportunities for students to confront and resolve them.

- **Discussion and reasoning are central**: Mathematical learning occurs through articulation, justification, and critique of ideas, not through silent individual practice.

### The Role of Misconceptions in Learning

A distinctive feature of Swan's approach was his view of misconceptions not as errors to be eliminated, but as essential stepping stones in the learning process. Building on the work of his colleague Alan Bell and others in the Shell Centre, Swan developed the approach known as "diagnostic teaching," which used carefully designed tasks to expose common misconceptions and create productive cognitive conflict.

Swan's research demonstrated that teaching which explicitly addresses misconceptions is more effective in producing long-term learning than teaching which presents only correct procedures. This insight, now widely accepted in mathematics education, was radical when Swan began his work and has since been validated by numerous studies.

## The Five Task Types for Conceptual Development

One of Swan's most enduring contributions is his classification of five task types designed to foster conceptual understanding. These task types, developed through extensive work with teachers and refined through classroom trials, provide a framework for designing activities that move beyond procedural practice toward deep conceptual engagement.

### 1. Classifying Mathematical Objects

In these tasks, students devise or apply classifications to sort mathematical objects according to their properties. For example, students might be given cards showing different algebraic expressions and asked to sort them into groups based on equivalent values. This activity requires students to discriminate between commonly confused expressions, articulate the properties that distinguish them, and recognise structural similarities.

The educational power of classification tasks lies in their demand for explicit reasoning. Students cannot simply calculate answers; they must consider the properties of mathematical objects and justify their groupings. This process often brings misconceptions to the surface, as students may initially group items based on superficial features rather than mathematical structure.

### 2. Interpreting Multiple Representations

Swan recognised that deep understanding of mathematical concepts requires the ability to move fluently between different representations—symbols, diagrams, tables, graphs, words, and concrete contexts. Tasks in this category ask students to match, translate between, or connect different representations of the same mathematical idea.

For example, students might be given cards showing algebraic expressions, word descriptions, area diagrams, and tables of values, and asked to assemble them into sets where each set represents the same underlying relationship. This activity develops what Swan called "structural understanding"—recognising that different representations share a common mathematical essence.

### 3. Evaluating Mathematical Statements

These tasks present students with mathematical claims and ask them to determine whether they are always, sometimes, or never true. This simple structure generates rich mathematical activity, as students must test cases, find counter-examples, and articulate the conditions under which statements hold.

Evaluating statements moves students from passive recipients of mathematical truth to active investigators. A claim such as "squaring a number always makes it bigger" requires students to test various cases, recognise that the statement is only sometimes true, identify the conditions (numbers greater than 1 or less than -1), and articulate why this is the case.

### 4. Creating Problems

Rather than simply solving problems devised by others, students in these tasks are asked to create their own problems meeting specified constraints. For instance, having learned about percentages, students might be asked to create a word problem that requires calculating a percentage increase and results in an answer of £120.

Problem creation reverses the typical classroom dynamic and requires deeper understanding than problem solving. To create a valid problem, students must understand the structure of the mathematics involved and anticipate how different elements affect the solution. This task type also generates materials for peer exchange, as students solve each other's problems.

### 5. Analysing Reasoning and Solutions

In these tasks, students examine worked solutions or reasoning processes and identify errors, compare approaches, or evaluate efficiency. For example, students might be shown several different methods for solving an equation and asked to identify which are correct, which are most efficient, and what errors were made in incorrect attempts.

Analysing reasoning develops critical mathematical thinking and helps students recognise that mathematics is about reasoning and justification, not merely obtaining correct answers. These tasks are particularly valuable for addressing misconceptions, as they allow common errors to be examined and discussed without identifying any particular student as having made them.

## The Standards Unit: Improving Learning in Mathematics

### Background and Development

In 2005, the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) Standards Unit published "Improving Learning in Mathematics: Challenges and Strategies," a comprehensive professional development resource written by Swan. This publication, often referred to simply as the "Standards Unit" materials, became one of the most widely used resources for post-16 mathematics professional development in England and has influenced mathematics teaching across all key stages.

The Standards Unit emerged from the government's response to the Smith Report (2004), which had identified significant concerns about mathematics education in England. The materials were developed by Swan working closely with Susan Wall, a Gatsby fellow based at Wilberforce College in Hull, and were grounded in research on effective mathematics teaching.

### Structure and Content

The Standards Unit materials comprise a book and accompanying sessions covering key mathematical topics that present difficulties for students from late primary through early secondary levels. The sessions exemplify Swan's five task types and are designed to be used by teachers working with colleagues in professional development settings.

Each session follows a consistent structure:

- **Introduction**: Contextualises the mathematics and identifies common student difficulties
- **Activity**: A collaborative task embodying one or more of the five task types
- **Discussion points**: Questions to prompt reflection on the mathematics and pedagogy
- **Suggestions for organisation**: Practical guidance for running the session with colleagues

The materials cover topics including number, algebra, geometry, and statistics, with particular attention to areas where research had identified persistent student difficulties and misconceptions.

### Impact on Professional Development

The Standards Unit materials represented a new model for mathematics professional development in England. Rather than simply telling teachers about research findings, the materials engaged teachers in collaborative mathematical activity—precisely the approach Swan advocated for classroom teaching. Teachers experienced as learners the same kind of rich, discussion-based tasks they were being encouraged to use with students.

This model of professional development has since become widely adopted. The principle that effective professional development should model the pedagogy it promotes is now recognised in the Education Endowment Foundation's guidance on effective professional development, and Swan's materials continue to be used in initial teacher education and continuing professional development programmes.

## Diagnostic Teaching: A Research-Based Approach

### Origins and Principles

Diagnostic teaching, as developed by Swan and his colleagues at the Shell Centre, is a method of teaching for long-term learning by exposing and working on students' mistakes and misconceptions. The approach emerged from research by Alan Bell, Swan, and others in the 1980s and 1990s, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC).

The core insight of diagnostic teaching is that many student errors in mathematics are not random mistakes but systematic misconceptions rooted in prior learning. For example, the common error of believing that "multiplication makes bigger" stems from students' early experience with whole numbers greater than 1 and persists as a default assumption even when students have encountered multiplication by fractions or decimals.

Swan's research demonstrated that teaching which simply tells students their misconceptions are wrong is less effective than teaching which creates opportunities for students to recognise the limitations of their existing ideas. Diagnostic teaching uses carefully designed tasks to make misconceptions explicit, creates contexts where they lead to contradictions or unworkable results, and supports students in developing more robust understanding.

### The Three-Stage Process

Swan articulated diagnostic teaching as a three-stage process:

**1. Elicitation**: Tasks are designed to reveal students' existing conceptions and misconceptions. This might involve pre-assessment, classifying activities, or evaluating statements. The goal is to make thinking visible so that instruction can be targeted to actual student understanding rather than assumed knowledge.

**2. Cognitive Conflict**: Students encounter situations where their existing conceptions prove inadequate. This might involve counter-examples, competing interpretations, or problems that cannot be solved using existing approaches. The conflict creates motivation for change and prepares students to consider alternatives.

**3. Resolution and Consolidation**: Students work through activities designed to develop more robust understanding. This involves not just learning correct procedures but understanding why they work, when they apply, and how they connect to other mathematical ideas. Consolidation activities help embed new understanding through varied practice and application.

### Professional Development for Diagnostic Teaching

Recognising that diagnostic teaching requires specific skills, Swan developed extensive professional development materials to support teachers in implementing the approach. These materials, produced in collaboration with the Mathematics Assessment Resource Service (MARS) and Michigan State University, include diagnostic assessments for key topics and guidance on using them to inform instruction.

The professional development programmes cover topics including fractions, decimals, percentages, algebraic expressions, equations, and functions. For each topic, teachers are provided with diagnostic questions that reveal common misconceptions, activities that create productive cognitive conflict, and resources for developing more robust understanding.

## The Mathematics Assessment Project (MAP)

### Development and Structure

From 2009 to 2017, Swan led the design of the Mathematics Assessment Project (MAP), a collaboration between the Shell Centre team and the University of California, Berkeley. Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, MAP developed 100 formative assessment lessons for students aged 11–17, designed to support the implementation of the US Common Core State Standards in Mathematics.

The MAP lessons, known as "Classroom Challenges," are divided into two types:

**Concept Development Lessons**: These focus on developing deep understanding of key mathematical concepts. They follow a structured format beginning with an initial individual assessment task, followed by collaborative activity designed to expose and address misconceptions, and concluding with a final individual task to assess progress.

**Problem Solving Lessons**: These focus on developing students' capacity to apply mathematical knowledge to non-routine problems. They present students with complex, unfamiliar problems and support them in developing strategies for tackling such challenges.

### Design Principles

The MAP lessons embody Swan's design principles, adapted for an international context. Each lesson is designed to be accessible to all students while offering opportunities for extension, promotes discussion and collaborative reasoning, addresses known misconceptions, and provides teachers with guidance on interpreting student responses and adjusting instruction accordingly.

The lessons have been downloaded over 7 million times and are used in classrooms worldwide. Their success demonstrates the transferability of Swan's approach across different educational contexts and curricula.

### Impact on Formative Assessment Practice

The MAP materials have had significant impact on formative assessment practice internationally. By embedding formative assessment within structured lesson designs, Swan demonstrated that formative assessment need not be an additional burden on teachers but could be integrated into normal classroom activity through well-designed materials.

The lessons exemplify what Swan called "diagnostic teaching"—using assessment not just to judge learning but to inform teaching. The initial assessment tasks reveal student thinking, the collaborative activities address identified difficulties, and the final tasks assess progress. This integrated approach has influenced subsequent developments in formative assessment, including work by the Education Endowment Foundation and others.

## Bowland Maths and PRIMAS

### Bowland Maths

Swan made significant contributions to Bowland Maths, a UK initiative funded by the Bowland Charitable Trust to develop innovative mathematics teaching materials for Key Stage 3 (ages 11–14). Working with the Shell Centre team and Alice Onion, Swan helped develop professional development modules and lesson materials that exemplified problem-based learning approaches.

The Bowland materials include extended problem-solving tasks set in real-world contexts, supported by professional development resources for teachers. The materials exemplify Swan's belief that mathematics should be taught as a tool for reasoning about meaningful problems, not merely as a set of abstract procedures.

### The PRIMAS Project

Swan also contributed to PRIMAS (Promoting Inquiry in Mathematics and Science Across Europe), an EU-funded project involving 14 universities across 12 countries. The project aimed to support teachers in developing inquiry-based learning approaches in mathematics and science.

For PRIMAS, Swan and the Shell Centre team developed professional development materials including video case studies of classroom practice, discussion prompts, and structured activities for teacher learning communities. The materials are available through the PRIMAS website and have been used in professional development programmes across Europe.

Both Bowland Maths and PRIMAS exemplify Swan's commitment to international collaboration and his belief that effective mathematics teaching transcends national boundaries. While contexts differ, the fundamental principles of engaging students in rich mathematical activity, addressing misconceptions, and promoting reasoning apply universally.

## Recognition and Legacy

### Awards and Honours

Swan's contributions to mathematics education were recognised through numerous awards and honours. In 2016, he and his long-time collaborator Hugh Burkhardt were chosen by the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction (ICMI) as the first recipients of the Emma Castelnuovo Medal for Excellence in the Practice of Mathematics Education. This prestigious award recognised their sustained contribution to the development of mathematics education through practical, research-informed materials.

The award citation noted that "Burkhardt and Swan have worked tirelessly for decades to improve the teaching and learning of mathematics through the development of practical, research-informed resources that are used by teachers worldwide."

### Enduring Influence

Swan's influence on mathematics education continues to be felt through the widespread use of his materials, the adoption of his design principles by curriculum developers internationally, and the ongoing impact of the diagnostic teaching approach on teacher education.

The Education Endowment Foundation's guidance on mathematics teaching cites Swan's work on formative assessment and collaborative learning. The five task types provide a framework used by teachers and curriculum designers to create conceptually focused activities. The Standards Unit materials remain in use for professional development, and the MAP lessons continue to be downloaded and used in classrooms worldwide.

Swan's approach—bridging research and practice through carefully designed, classroom-tested materials—has become a model for educational development. His work demonstrates that educational research can have significant practical impact when translated into usable resources that support teachers in implementing research-informed approaches.

## Implications for Classroom Practice

### Implementing Swan's Principles

For teachers seeking to apply Swan's insights in their classrooms, several key principles emerge:

**Use rich, collaborative tasks**: Select activities that require students to think, reason, and discuss rather than simply practise procedures. The five task types provide a framework for designing or selecting such activities.

**Make thinking visible**: Use diagnostic questions and tasks to reveal student thinking before instruction. Understanding what students actually think is essential for targeted teaching.

**Address misconceptions explicitly**: Don't avoid misconceptions—bring them to the surface and create opportunities for students to recognise and resolve them.

**Promote discussion**: Structure lessons to include opportunities for students to explain, justify, and critique mathematical ideas. Mathematical learning is social as well as individual.

**Connect representations**: Ensure students experience mathematical concepts through multiple representations and develop fluency in moving between them.

### Using Swan's Materials

Swan's published materials provide practical support for implementing these principles:

- **Standards Unit**: The professional development sessions can be used with colleagues to explore the five task types and diagnostic teaching approaches.

- **Mathematics Assessment Project**: The Classroom Challenges provide ready-to-use lessons embodying Swan's design principles.

- **Diagnostic Teaching Materials**: The professional development packages for teachers include diagnostic assessments and guidance on addressing identified misconceptions.
