# Richard Skemp: Relational and Instrumental Understanding in Mathematics Education

## Biography and Academic Background

Richard Rowland Skemp (10 March 1919 – 22 June 1995) was a British mathematician, psychologist, and educational theorist who made foundational contributions to mathematics education. Born in Bristol, Skemp began his professional career as a secondary school mathematics teacher at Oundle School and later Sherborne School, Oxford. His practical classroom experience would profoundly shape his later theoretical work.

In 1955, Skemp made a significant career transition, becoming a Lecturer in Psychology at the University of Manchester. This move reflected his growing interest in the psychological dimensions of learning mathematics—how children acquire mathematical concepts, the cognitive structures involved, and the emotional factors that influence mathematical learning. He was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 1962 and remained at Manchester until 1973.

From 1973 to 1986, Skemp served as Professor of Educational Theory at the University of Warwick, where he established the Mathematics Education Research Centre. During this period, he produced his most influential work, including the seminal book *The Psychology of Learning Mathematics* (first published in 1971, with an expanded American edition in 1987). He was elected a Fellow of the British Psychological Society (FBPsS) in recognition of his interdisciplinary contributions.

Skemp's unique position as both a mathematician and a psychologist allowed him to bridge these disciplines in ways that had not been attempted before. As Maths — No Problem! observes, he was "the first mathematician to bring together mathematics, psychology and education" into a coherent theoretical framework for understanding mathematical learning.

## The Distinction: Relational vs. Instrumental Understanding

Skemp's most enduring contribution to mathematics education is his distinction between two fundamentally different types of mathematical understanding, first articulated in his seminal 1976 article "Relational Understanding and Instrumental Understanding" published in *Mathematics Teaching* (Issue 77, pp. 20-26).

### Defining the Two Types of Understanding

**Instrumental Understanding**

Instrumental understanding, as Skemp defined it, is "rules without reasons." It describes the capacity to execute mathematical procedures correctly without understanding why those procedures work. A learner with instrumental understanding knows *what* to do but not *why* it works.

Skemp used the metaphor of a plan or recipe: instrumental learning provides a set of instructions for getting from a starting point to a desired outcome, but each route is learned separately as a distinct procedure. The learner has "a collection of plans" rather than an interconnected network of knowledge.

**Examples of Instrumental Understanding:**
- Knowing to "invert and multiply" when dividing fractions without understanding why this procedure yields the correct answer
- Memorising the formula for the area of a triangle (½ × base × height) as an isolated fact rather than understanding its relationship to the area of a parallelogram and rectangle
- Following the "BODMAS" or "PEMDAS" order of operations as a rote rule without understanding the mathematical logic behind the sequence
- Using "cross-multiplication" to solve proportions without grasping the underlying concept of equivalent ratios

**Relational Understanding**

Relational understanding, by contrast, involves knowing both *what* to do and *why*. It is grounded in conceptual comprehension and enables the learner to construct their own methods for solving novel problems. Relational understanding consists of building up a conceptual structure—or schema—from which the possessor can generate an unlimited number of procedures for getting from any starting point within their schema to any finishing point.

**Examples of Relational Understanding:**
- Understanding that dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal because division and multiplication are inverse operations, and this relationship can be demonstrated through concrete models
- Recognising that the area formula for triangles derives from the parallelogram formula (which itself derives from the rectangle), creating a connected hierarchy of geometric understanding
- Grasping that order of operations conventions exist to preserve mathematical consistency and the structural properties of operations

### The Table of Consequences

| Aspect | Instrumental Understanding | Relational Understanding |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Memory** | Requires remembering multiple separate rules; easily forgotten | Information is stored as part of a connected schema; easier to remember |
| **Transfer** | Skills are situation-specific; difficult to apply to new problems | Enables adaptation to novel situations; facilitates problem-solving |
| **Errors** | Errors indicate rule misapplication; hard to detect without checking | Errors are often self-correcting because they violate structural relationships |
| **Discovery** | Little scope for independent discovery | Enables generation of new methods and solutions |

## Schema Theory and Intelligent Learning

### The Concept of Schema

Central to Skemp's theoretical framework is the concept of the **schema**—a cognitive structure that represents the relationships an individual has become aware of between concepts and processes. Schemas are not simply collections of facts but organised networks of knowledge that enable the individual to interpret new information and solve problems.

**Key Characteristics of Schemas:**

1. **Hierarchical organisation**: Mathematical concepts form extensive hierarchies, with advanced concepts depending on subsidiary ones. One cannot understand fractions without first understanding whole numbers and division.

2. **Interconnectedness**: Schemas link related concepts, enabling the learner to see mathematics as a coherent system rather than isolated facts and procedures.

3. **Generative power**: A well-developed schema allows the learner to generate new procedures and solutions rather than relying on memorised rules.

4. **Adaptive function**: Schemas enable individuals to cope with novel situations by applying existing structures to new problems.

### Three Modes of Schema Construction

**1. Building from Experience (Empirical Learning)**

In this mode, learners construct schemas through direct interaction with the physical world. They observe patterns, make conjectures, and test hypotheses through practical activity. For example, children develop early number concepts through counting objects, comparing quantities, and sharing items among groups.

**2. Building from Language (Symbolic Learning)**

This mode involves constructing schemas through the symbolic systems of mathematics—numerals, operation signs, algebraic notation, and the linguistic structures of mathematical discourse. Skemp emphasised that symbolic learning is most effective when it is anchored in experiential understanding.

**3. Building from Existing Schemas (Reflective Learning)**

The most advanced mode involves consciously reflecting on and restructuring existing schemas. This metacognitive process enables learners to integrate previously separate areas of knowledge and to recognise higher-order patterns and structures.

### The Goal: Intelligent Learning

Skemp used the term **intelligent learning** to describe the process of schema construction and modification. This term was carefully chosen to contrast with rote learning or conditioning. Intelligent learning is:

- **Active**: The learner constructs knowledge rather than passively receiving it
- **Constructive**: New learning builds on and connects to existing schemas
- **Adaptive**: The resulting schemas enable flexible response to new situations
- **Self-regulating**: Learners can monitor their own understanding and identify gaps

## Pedagogical Implications

### The Mismatch Problem

One of Skemp's most important insights concerns what he called the **mismatch problem**—the situation that arises when teachers and students are oriented toward different types of understanding.

| Teacher's Goal | Student's Goal | Outcome |
|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Relational | Relational | Ideal: mutual satisfaction of genuine understanding |
| Relational | Instrumental | Student frustration; teacher perceives student as unmotivated |
| Instrumental | Relational | Student frustration; teacher perceives student as demanding unnecessary explanation |
| Instrumental | Instrumental | Transactional success but limited long-term learning |

### Teaching for Relational Understanding

Skemp's work suggests several principles for teaching that fosters relational understanding:

**1. Start with Conceptual Foundations**

Before introducing procedures, ensure that students have the conceptual foundations on which those procedures depend. For example, before teaching the algorithm for column addition, students should understand place value and the concept of combining quantities.

**2. Use Multiple Representations**

Mathematical concepts can be represented concretely (physical objects), pictorially (diagrams and images), and abstractly (symbols and notation). Moving between these representations helps students build robust, flexible schemas. This principle aligns with what is now called the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach.

**3. Encourage Discovery and Exploration**

When students discover relationships for themselves, the resulting understanding is more robust than when relationships are merely explained. Skemp advocated for problem-solving approaches that give students opportunities to construct their own methods before being shown standard algorithms.

**4. Make Connections Explicit**

Help students see how new concepts connect to what they already know. Explicitly discuss the relationships between topics—for example, how fractions, decimals, and percentages are different representations of the same underlying concept.

## Connection to Modern Mathematics Mastery

### The Singapore Mathematics Connection

Skemp's ideas have experienced a significant revival through their influence on the Singapore mathematics curriculum and the broader "teaching for mastery" movement. Singapore mathematics, which has achieved international recognition for its effectiveness, is described by Maths — No Problem! as "an amalgamation of global ideas delivered as a highly effective programme of teaching methods and resources" based on the work of "notable experts such as Jerome Bruner, Richard Skemp, Jean Piaget, Lev Vygotsky, and Zoltan Dienes."

Several core principles of Singapore mathematics and mastery teaching directly reflect Skemp's insights:

**1. The CPA Approach**

The Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) progression in Singapore mathematics embodies Skemp's emphasis on building schemas through multiple representations. Learners first encounter concepts through concrete materials, then through pictorial representations, and finally through abstract symbols. This progression ensures that abstract understanding is anchored in experiential knowledge.

**2. Emphasis on Deep Understanding**

Mastery teaching prioritises deep conceptual understanding over rapid coverage of content. This aligns with Skemp's argument that relational understanding, though initially slower to develop, produces more robust and transferable learning.

**3. The Whole Class Moves Together**

Mastery approaches typically keep the class working on the same content, with differentiation achieved through depth of exploration rather than acceleration. This reflects Skemp's insight that mathematical learning depends on secure foundations—students should not progress to new topics until they have developed the necessary schemas.

### UK Mathematics Mastery

Skemp's influence is evident in the UK's adoption of mastery approaches, particularly through the NCETM (National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics) and the Maths Hubs programme. Key documents and frameworks routinely cite Skemp's distinction between relational and instrumental understanding as a foundational concept.

The Department for Education's approval of mastery textbooks and resources, including those from Maths — No Problem!, represents official recognition of approaches that embody Skemp's principles. Ofsted's increasing emphasis on deep conceptual understanding in mathematics inspections further reinforces this direction.

## Legacy and Continuing Relevance

Richard Skemp's work remains foundational to mathematics education theory and practice. His distinction between relational and instrumental understanding provides a vocabulary for discussing the goals of mathematics teaching that is still widely used in teacher education and professional development.

The resurgence of mastery teaching, in the UK and internationally, represents a practical validation of Skemp's insights. As educators seek to move beyond superficial coverage of content toward deep, lasting mathematical understanding, Skemp's framework offers both a diagnostic tool (what type of understanding are we fostering?) and a guiding principle (how can we teach for relational understanding?).

For classroom teachers, Skemp's work serves as a reminder to question the assumptions underlying their practice:
- Are we teaching rules or relationships?
- Do our students know *why* as well as *what*?
- Are we building schemas or collecting isolated facts?
- Are we addressing the mismatch between our goals and our students' expectations?

In an era of high-stakes testing and curriculum pressure, Skemp's advocacy for relational understanding as the proper goal of mathematics education remains as relevant as ever. His work challenges educators to resist the temptation to prioritise short-term performance over long-term understanding and to recognise that how students learn mathematics shapes not only what they know but how they think.
