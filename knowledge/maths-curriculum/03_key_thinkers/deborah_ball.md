# Deborah Loewenberg Ball: Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching

## Biographical Overview

Deborah Loewenberg Ball stands as one of the most influential figures in mathematics education research of the past four decades. She currently serves as the **William H. Payne Collegiate Professor of Education** at the University of Michigan Marsal Family School of Education, where she is also an Arthur F. Thurnau Professor and the founding director of **TeachingWorks**. From 2005 to 2016, Ball served as dean of the School of Education, and from 2017 to 2018, she held the prestigious position of president of the American Educational Research Association (AERA).

Ball's journey into mathematics education was unconventional. As an undergraduate at Michigan State University, she majored in French, not mathematics. She then spent **seventeen years as an elementary school teacher** in East Lansing, Michigan. It was through her classroom practice—observing her own students struggle with mathematical concepts—that Ball developed the serious interest in mathematics that would later define her scholarly career. This practitioner foundation remains central to her identity; she continues to teach elementary mathematics every summer, maintaining what she describes as essential grounding in the realities of classroom instruction.

In 1988, Ball received her Ph.D. from Michigan State University's Department of Teacher Education. Her dissertation, titled *Knowledge and Reasoning in Mathematical Pedagogy: Examining What Prospective Teachers Bring to Teacher Education*, signalled the direction her research would take: investigating the specialised knowledge that teachers need to teach mathematics effectively. Ball has received numerous accolades, including the 19th Louise Hay Award for Outstanding Contributions to Mathematics Education (2009), election to the National Academy of Education (2007), and fellowship in the American Mathematical Society (2012).

## The Problem: What Mathematics Do Teachers Need to Know?

### The Conventional Wisdom and Its Limitations

For much of the twentieth century, the prevailing assumption about teacher knowledge was straightforward: teachers needed to know more mathematics than their students. The conventional hypothesis was essentially quantitative—teachers should study mathematics for several years beyond the level they would teach. A secondary teacher, for example, should have university-level mathematics; an elementary teacher should have secondary mathematics.

This assumption underpinned much teacher preparation policy and practice. Yet Ball's classroom experience suggested a more complex picture. She observed that knowing advanced mathematics did not necessarily translate into being able to explain why a particular procedure worked, diagnose a student's misconception, or select representations that would illuminate rather than obscure mathematical structure. A mathematician might possess deep disciplinary knowledge yet struggle to help a Year 3 pupil understand why the "invert and multiply" rule for dividing fractions actually works.

### Lee Shulman's Pedagogical Content Knowledge

Ball's work builds upon Lee Shulman's foundational concept of **pedagogical content knowledge (PCK)**, introduced in the 1980s. Shulman argued that teaching requires a special amalgam of content and pedagogy—knowledge that goes beyond subject matter knowledge per se to include "the most useful forms of representation of those ideas, the most powerful analogies, illustrations, examples, explanations, and demonstrations—in a word, the ways of representing and formulating the subject that make it comprehensible to others."

Shulman's PCK concept was revolutionary in recognising that teaching demands knowledge that is distinct from but related to disciplinary knowledge. However, Shulman and his colleagues did not fully develop what PCK looked like in specific subjects. Ball's contribution has been to elaborate this framework for mathematics—to identify the particular knowledge that mathematics teachers need and to develop ways of measuring it.

### Ball's Practice-Based Theory

Ball's approach is distinctive in being **practice-based**. Rather than starting with abstract theories about what teachers ought to know, she and her colleagues studied what teachers actually do in the work of teaching. They analysed videotapes of instruction, examined curriculum materials, and investigated the demands that teaching places on teachers' mathematical knowledge.

This empirical approach led Ball to argue that the mathematical knowledge needed for teaching is **qualitatively different** from what is taught in advanced mathematics classes. University mathematics courses—calculus, linear algebra, abstract algebra—do develop mathematical sophistication, but they do not necessarily develop the specific mathematical sensibilities that teachers need. Teaching requires attending to mathematical detail in the context of student thinking, making judgements about mathematical correctness in the midst of instruction, and connecting mathematical ideas across the curriculum in ways that support student learning.

## The Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching (MKT) Framework

### Overview of the Domain

Through extensive empirical investigation, Ball and her colleagues at the University of Michigan developed a comprehensive framework for **Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching (MKT)**. First articulated in their seminal 2008 paper "Content Knowledge for Teaching: What Makes It Special?" (co-authored with Mark Hoover Thames and Geoffrey Phelps), the framework maps the domain of knowledge that mathematics teachers need.

The MKT framework distinguishes between **Subject Matter Knowledge** and **Pedagogical Content Knowledge**, while further subdividing each into more specific domains. This refinement allows for finer-grained analysis of what teachers need to know and do.

### Subject Matter Knowledge Domains

#### Common Content Knowledge (CCK)

**Common Content Knowledge** refers to the mathematical knowledge and skills that are used in settings other than teaching. This includes knowing how to solve mathematical problems, understanding mathematical procedures, and being able to compute accurately. CCK is "common" in the sense that it is not unique to teaching—mathematicians, engineers, and accountants all use this knowledge.

For example, knowing that 2/3 ÷ 1/6 = 4, being able to calculate this correctly, and understanding why the answer is 4 represents common content knowledge. This is the knowledge that might be developed through standard mathematics coursework.

However—and this is crucial—Ball's research demonstrates that CCK alone is **insufficient** for teaching. Teachers need to know much more than how to solve problems correctly themselves.

#### Specialised Content Knowledge (SCK)

**Specialised Content Knowledge** is the mathematical knowledge that is particular to teaching. It is not needed for purposes other than teaching mathematics. SCK includes:

- **Analysing errors**: Understanding why a student's incorrect answer makes sense to them, diagnosing the mathematical source of the error, and determining what response would help the student develop correct understanding.

- **Evaluating representations**: Assessing whether a particular representation (diagram, manipulative, analogy) accurately captures the mathematical structure being taught, or whether it might inadvertently introduce misconceptions.

- **Making mathematical connections**: Seeing how topics across the curriculum relate to one another, understanding what mathematical ideas underpin procedures, and knowing how concepts develop across grade levels.

- **Interpreting mathematical explanations**: Hearing a student's non-standard explanation and recognising the mathematical validity (or invalidity) of their reasoning.

For instance, when a Year 5 pupil explains that they found 17 × 6 by calculating 10 × 6 = 60, 7 × 6 = 42, and 60 + 42 = 102, a teacher needs SCK to recognise this as an application of the distributive property—(10 + 7) × 6 = (10 × 6) + (7 × 6)—and to connect this informal reasoning to the formal mathematical structure that will become increasingly important in algebra.

#### Knowledge at the Mathematical Horizon

**Knowledge at the Mathematical Horizon** refers to understanding how the mathematics being taught fits into the broader mathematical landscape. Teachers need to know where the mathematics they are teaching is heading—what it connects to in later years, how it prepares students for more advanced concepts, and what the mathematical "big ideas" are that span multiple topics.

This is not simply knowing the content of later years. It is understanding the mathematical significance of elementary topics. When teaching multiplication of whole numbers, a teacher with horizon knowledge understands how this connects to multiplication of fractions, to area models, to algebraic multiplication of binomials, and eventually to matrix operations. This knowledge enables teachers to make decisions about what to emphasise and how to frame topics in ways that support long-term mathematical development.

### Pedagogical Content Knowledge Domains

#### Knowledge of Content and Students (KCS)

**Knowledge of Content and Students** combines knowing mathematics with knowing how students think about and learn mathematics. This domain includes:

- **Anticipating student thinking**: Predicting what students are likely to find difficult, what errors they might make, and what misconceptions are common for particular topics.

- **Interpreting student understanding**: Hearing what students say and recognising the mathematical thinking behind their words—both when they are correct and when they are struggling.

- **Knowing developmental trajectories**: Understanding how mathematical ideas develop in learners over time, what progression looks like, and what experiences support that progression.

- **Recognising common misconceptions**: Being familiar with the typical ways that students misunderstand particular concepts and knowing why these errors are seductive.

For example, KCS includes knowing that many students will add fractions by adding numerators and denominators (1/2 + 1/3 = 2/5), understanding why this error makes sense to students (it follows the pattern of multiplication), and anticipating which representations or explanations might help students see why this approach is problematic.

#### Knowledge of Content and Teaching (KCT)

**Knowledge of Content and Teaching** involves the design of instruction—the knowledge needed to sequence content, select examples, choose representations, and determine the most effective instructional approaches for particular mathematical goals. This includes:

- **Sequencing content**: Determining the optimal order for presenting topics, deciding what to teach before what, and understanding how different mathematical ideas depend upon one another.

- **Selecting examples**: Choosing numbers and problems that will highlight particular mathematical structures, that vary systematically to illuminate patterns, and that are appropriately challenging.

- **Choosing representations**: Deciding which diagrams, manipulatives, or contexts will best support understanding of particular concepts, and knowing how to use these representations effectively.

- **Managing mathematical discussion**: Knowing how to orchestrate classroom conversations about mathematics—what questions to ask, how to respond to student contributions, and how to build coherent mathematical narratives from student ideas.

For instance, when teaching division of fractions, a teacher draws on KCT to decide whether to use a measurement interpretation ("how many 1/6s are in 2/3?"), a partitive interpretation ("what is 2/3 divided into 6 equal groups?"), or an area model; to select examples that illuminate the concept; and to sequence instruction from concrete to abstract representations.

#### Knowledge of Curriculum

**Knowledge of Curriculum** encompasses familiarity with the available curriculum materials, the scope and sequence of content across years, and the expectations set by standards and assessments. Teachers need to know what their curriculum covers, how it is organised, and how it aligns with external requirements.

This domain has become increasingly important as curriculum standards have been formalised (such as the National Curriculum in England). Teachers need to navigate between the curriculum they are provided, the standards they are accountable to, and the mathematical learning needs of their students.

## Evidence for the Importance of MKT

### The Mathematical Quality of Instruction

Ball's research programme has not only developed the MKT framework but has also investigated its relationship to the quality of instruction. In collaboration with Heather Hill and others, Ball developed instruments to measure teachers' MKT and to assess the **mathematical quality of instruction (MQI)** in classrooms.

The MQI framework evaluates instruction along several dimensions:

- **Richness of the mathematics**: The extent to which instruction focuses on mathematical meaning, connections, and reasoning rather than mere procedure.

- **Mathematical errors and imprecision**: Whether the mathematics presented is accurate and clearly communicated.

- **Student participation in mathematical reasoning**: The opportunities students have to engage with mathematical ideas through explanation, justification, and analysis.

- **Working with mathematical language and symbols**: How clearly and precisely mathematical language is used.

Studies using these measures have found **significant relationships** between teachers' MKT and the mathematical quality of their instruction. Teachers with stronger MKT are more likely to present mathematics accurately, to make connections between ideas, to respond appropriately to student errors, and to maintain focus on mathematical meaning rather than procedural manipulation alone.

### Impact on Student Achievement

Perhaps the most important evidence for the significance of MKT comes from studies examining student outcomes. In a landmark study published in the *American Educational Research Journal* (2005), Hill, Rowan, and Ball found that teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching was a significant predictor of student achievement gains in mathematics. This relationship held even after controlling for various student background characteristics.

Critically, the study found that **teachers' general mathematical knowledge** (as measured by standard mathematics tests) was **not** a significant predictor of student achievement. What mattered was not how much mathematics teachers had studied in the abstract, but the specific mathematical knowledge they possessed for the work of teaching.

This finding has profound implications for teacher preparation and professional development. It suggests that simply requiring teachers to take more standard mathematics courses may not improve student learning. Instead, teachers need opportunities to develop the specialised forms of knowledge that the MKT framework identifies.

### International Validation

The MKT framework has been validated and adapted for use in multiple countries, including Ireland, Ghana, Norway, and Indonesia. While the specific mathematical demands of teaching vary across cultural and curricular contexts, the basic insight—that teaching requires specialised knowledge beyond common content knowledge—appears robust across settings.

The Learning Mathematics for Teaching (LMT) project at the University of Michigan developed multiple-choice measures of MKT that have been used in large-scale studies and adapted for international use. These measures assess the various domains of MKT through teaching scenarios that require teachers to analyse student work, evaluate instructional approaches, and make mathematical judgements in teaching contexts.

## TeachingWorks and High-Leverage Practices

### A New Direction in Teacher Preparation

In 2011, Ball founded **TeachingWorks**, a major initiative at the University of Michigan focused on transforming how teachers are prepared for practice. TeachingWorks represents an extension of Ball's earlier work on MKT, applying the same practice-based approach to the development of teaching skill.

The fundamental premise of TeachingWorks is that teaching is a **professional practice** that can be learned and improved through deliberate effort. This contrasts with views that see teaching as primarily a matter of innate talent or personality. Ball argues that, like other professional practices (medicine, law, engineering), teaching involves learnable skills that can be developed through focused preparation and ongoing professional learning.

### High-Leverage Teaching Practices

Central to the TeachingWorks approach is the identification of **high-leverage teaching practices**—discrete, learnable components of teaching that have significant power for supporting student learning and that are used frequently across different curricula and teaching approaches.

Ball and her colleagues have identified a set of core practices that form the foundation of responsible beginning teaching. These include:

1. **Leading a group discussion**: Facilitating meaningful conversation about academic content, ensuring broad participation, and building coherent understanding from multiple student contributions.

2. **Explaining and modelling content**: Making content clear through explanation, demonstration, and representation, while maintaining focus on underlying meaning.
3
. **Eliciting and interpreting individual students' thinking**: Drawing out what students understand through questioning and observation, and making sense of their mathematical reasoning.

4. **Diagnosing particular common patterns of student thinking**: Recognising common patterns in how students think about content, including common misconceptions, and determining appropriate instructional responses.

5. **Implementing norms and routines for classroom discourse**: Establishing and maintaining expectations for how students participate in academic discussion.

6. **Coordinating and adjusting instruction during a lesson**: Making in-the-moment decisions about how to respond to student contributions and adjust the trajectory of instruction.

### Practice-Based Teacher Education

TeachingWorks develops and disseminates resources for **practice-based teacher education**—approaches that focus on the development of core teaching practices through deliberate practice, analysis of teaching, and feedback. This includes:

- **Records of practice**: Video recordings of teaching, student work samples, and lesson plans that provide opportunities for novice teachers to study and analyse teaching.

- **Practice-based pedagogies**: Methods such as rehearsal, where novices practise teaching skills with peers and receive feedback before trying them with students.

- **Assessment of practice**: Tools for observing and providing feedback on novices' developing practice.

Ball's vision is that teacher education should be organised around the development of high-leverage practices, with novices having repeated opportunities to practise these skills in increasingly complex settings, supported by mentors and peers who can provide constructive feedback.

## Implications for Teacher Development

### Rethinking Teacher Preparation

The MKT framework and the TeachingWorks approach have significant implications for how we prepare teachers. Ball's research suggests that teacher preparation should:

- **Focus on the mathematics that teachers will teach**, not just more advanced mathematics. While university mathematics has value, it does not automatically develop the specialised knowledge that teachers need.

- **Engage novices with the work of teaching from the start**, rather than delaying practice until after extensive coursework. Prospective teachers need opportunities to engage with student thinking, analyse instructional decisions, and practise teaching skills.

- **Develop specialised knowledge through attention to teaching practice**, connecting mathematical learning to the demands of teaching. Mathematics courses for teachers should be designed around the mathematical problems that arise in teaching.

- **Use records of practice** to make teaching visible and available for study. Video, student work, and curriculum materials provide essential resources for learning to teach.

### Professional Development for Practising Teachers

For practising teachers, the MKT framework suggests directions for professional development that go beyond simply "learning more mathematics." Effective professional development should:

- **Focus on student thinking**: Help teachers understand how students develop mathematical ideas, what misconceptions are common, and how to respond to student reasoning.

- **Analyse the mathematical work of teaching**: Engage teachers in the kind of analysis that develops specialised content knowledge—evaluating representations, analysing errors, making mathematical connections.

- **Connect to curriculum and instruction**: Ground professional learning in the materials and practices that teachers use daily, rather than treating content knowledge as abstract and separate from practice.

- **Develop practice through rehearsal and feedback**: Provide opportunities for teachers to rehearse instructional moves, receive feedback, and refine their practice.

### Policy Implications

Ball's work has informed policy discussions about teacher quality and preparation. Her research suggests that:

- **Teacher certification requirements** should attend to the specific knowledge needed for teaching, not just general academic preparation.

- **Professional standards** should articulate the knowledge and skills that characterise accomplished teaching.

- **Assessment of teacher knowledge**
