# Ruth Merttens: Champion of Parental Engagement and Accessible Mathematics Education

## Biographical Overview

Professor Ruth Merttens stands as one of the most influential figures in British primary mathematics education over the past four decades. Her career has encompassed roles as an academic researcher, teacher educator, curriculum developer, and passionate advocate for making mathematics accessible to all children through meaningful parental involvement. As Director of the Hamilton Maths and Reading Projects and former Professor of Education at the University College of St Mark and St John, Plymouth, Merttens has shaped mathematics education policy and practice across thousands of UK primary schools.

Merttens' educational philosophy centres on three interconnected principles: that mathematics should be taught through problem-solving and investigation rather than rote procedure; that parents are essential partners in children's mathematical development; and that curriculum resources must be practical, accessible, and responsive to the realities of diverse classrooms. These principles have manifested in her pioneering research, her influential textbook publications, and her extensive work supporting teachers through the Hamilton Trust.

## The IMPACT Project: Inventing Mathematics for Parents and Children

### Origins and Rationale

The IMPACT project (Inventing Mathematics for Parents And Children and Teachers) represents Merttens' most significant contribution to mathematics education research. Initiated in 1985 with her collaborator Dr Jeff Vass, the project emerged from a recognition that parental involvement in mathematics lagged dramatically behind the well-established tradition of shared reading. While parents routinely engaged with their children through bedtime stories and library visits, mathematics homework remained an isolated, individual activity that often generated anxiety rather than connection.

Merttens observed that the traditional model of mathematics homework—where children completed worksheets independently at home—created several problems. Parents felt excluded from their children's mathematical learning, unable to support or even understand the methods being taught. Children who struggled had no immediate assistance, leading to frustration and the reinforcement of negative attitudes toward mathematics. The gap between home and school mathematical experiences meant that children rarely recognised the mathematics embedded in everyday family activities.

### Project Design and Implementation

The IMPACT project developed an alternative model of homework that positioned parents as active participants in mathematical learning rather than passive supervisors. The approach involved sending home mathematical games, investigations, and collaborative activities designed to be completed jointly by parents and children. These activities were deliberately chosen to reveal the mathematics inherent in everyday situations—cooking, shopping, planning journeys, playing board games—while also connecting to the concepts being taught at school.

The project initially operated in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham, working closely with teachers and families to develop and refine materials. Teachers received professional development on how to introduce IMPACT activities, explain their purpose to parents, and follow up on home learning in the classroom. Parents attended workshops where they could experience the activities themselves, addressing their own mathematical anxieties and building confidence in supporting their children.

### Key Findings and Outcomes

Merttens and Vass documented the IMPACT project's effects through extensive research published in their seminal 1990 book *Sharing Maths Cultures: IMPACT* and the 1993 edited volume *Partnerships in Maths: Parents and Schools—the IMPACT Project*. Their findings demonstrated that involving parents in curriculum-based mathematical activities had significant positive effects on children's attainment, attitudes, and confidence.

Children participating in IMPACT showed improved performance on standardised mathematics assessments, but the benefits extended beyond test scores. Parents reported greater understanding of modern mathematics teaching methods and increased confidence in discussing mathematical ideas with their children. Teachers observed that children returned to school with richer mathematical experiences to share, and that classroom discussions were enhanced by the common reference points established through shared activities.

The project also revealed important insights about the nature of parental involvement. Merttens found that effective engagement required more than simply sending materials home; it needed sustained patterns of direct contact between school and home, clear communication about the purpose of activities, and recognition of the diverse circumstances and capabilities of families. The project developed strategies for engaging hard-to-reach parents, including those with limited English proficiency, those who had negative experiences of their own schooling, and those juggling multiple jobs and caring responsibilities.

### Legacy and Influence

The IMPACT project's influence extends far beyond its original implementation. The concept of shared mathematics homework has been adopted and adapted by schools across the UK and internationally. Merttens' research informed government policy on parental engagement, contributing to recognition that raising standards in mathematics required partnership between schools and families. The project's emphasis on meaningful, collaborative activities contrasted sharply with the worksheet-based homework that remained common in many schools, helping to shift practice toward more purposeful home learning.

Academic research on parental involvement in mathematics has consistently referenced Merttens and Vass's work as foundational. Studies examining home-school partnerships, mathematical identity formation, and the role of family resources in mathematical learning have built upon the conceptual framework established through IMPACT.

## The Hamilton Trust: Democratising Quality Mathematics Resources

### Founding and Mission

As Director of the Hamilton Maths and Reading Projects, Merttens has overseen the development of one of the UK's most widely used sources of primary mathematics planning and resources. The Hamilton Trust was established with a clear mission: to provide high-quality, practical teaching resources that reduce teacher workload while promoting effective pedagogy. Under Merttens' leadership, this mission has been realised through the creation of thousands of lesson plans, activities, and assessment materials.

The Hamilton maths plans reflect Merttens' educational philosophy in their structure and content. They are organised into units, each containing sequences of 2–5 lessons covering closely related mathematical concepts. The plans emphasise problem-solving and investigative approaches, providing teachers with practical activities that engage children in mathematical thinking rather than passive reception of procedures.

### Free Resources and Accessibility

A distinctive feature of the Hamilton Trust under Merttens' direction has been the commitment to making substantial resources available free of charge. Over 1,000 documents are freely accessible, including complete sets of weekly plans for mixed-age classes. This approach reflects Merttens' belief that quality curriculum support should not be limited to schools with generous budgets.

The free resources have proven particularly valuable for small schools, rural schools, and schools serving disadvantaged communities—settings where teacher time is especially precious and specialist mathematics expertise may be limited. The mixed-age planning materials address a genuine need in the primary sector, where many teachers work with classes spanning multiple year groups.

### Pedagogical Approach in Hamilton Materials

The Hamilton maths plans embody Merttens' problem-solving and investigatory approach to mathematics teaching. Lessons are structured around meaningful contexts and questions rather than abstract procedures. Children are encouraged to explore multiple strategies, explain their reasoning, and make connections between mathematical concepts. The plans incorporate games and practical activities that make mathematical learning engaging while developing conceptual understanding.

Differentiation is handled through depth rather than acceleration—a principle consistent with the mastery approaches that gained prominence in subsequent years. The materials provide challenges that extend thinking within the same conceptual territory rather than pushing children forward to content from later years.

## Abacus: Shaping Commercial Mathematics Publishing

### Series Editorship

Merttens' influence on primary mathematics extends into commercial publishing through her role as Series Editor for Abacus, one of the UK's most widely adopted mathematics schemes. Published by Pearson, the Abacus programme was developed for the 2014 National Curriculum and has been used by thousands of schools both in the UK and internationally. Merttens led an expert author team in creating a comprehensive toolkit spanning textbooks, workbooks, teacher guides, and digital resources.

The Abacus scheme reflects Merttens' commitment to practical, accessible resources that support teachers in implementing effective pedagogy. The materials are designed to align fully with the National Curriculum while providing the flexibility for teachers to adapt to their particular contexts.

### Philosophy and Design Principles

Under Merttens' editorial direction, Abacus was crafted around several core principles. The scheme emphasises conceptual understanding alongside procedural fluency, ensuring that children understand why mathematical procedures work rather than simply executing them correctly. It incorporates rich problem-solving and reasoning activities that require children to apply their mathematical knowledge in unfamiliar contexts.

The Abacus workbooks exemplify Merttens' approach to practice and consolidation. Rather than pages of repetitive calculations, they include varied question types, self-assessment opportunities, and 'think' prompts that encourage reflection on mathematical strategies. The 'action' suggestions make activities more practical and engaging.

## Critique of Shanghai-Style Mathematics Teaching

### The 2015 Guardian Article

In February 2015, Merttens published a provocative article in *The Guardian* titled "Why are we blindly following the Chinese approach to teaching maths?" The piece offered a powerful critique of the then-emerging government enthusiasm for importing Shanghai-style mathematics teaching into English primary schools. Schools minister Nick Gibb had been advocating for Chinese and Singaporean textbooks, arguing that their systematic, teacher-led approaches explained these countries' success in international assessments.

Merttens' critique drew on her decades of experience in primary classrooms and her deep understanding of English educational culture. She argued that the highly prescriptive approach being promoted—where all children work through the same textbook simultaneously, following identical methods and layouts—was fundamentally at odds with the creativity, diversity, and individualised attention that characterised effective English primary practice.

### Pedagogical Arguments

Merttens' critique extended beyond cultural preference to address specific pedagogical concerns. She argued that teaching primary children to follow prescribed procedures without understanding why they work would produce instrumental understanding at best—children who could calculate correctly but would struggle to apply their knowledge flexibly or solve unfamiliar problems.

Her critique also addressed the role of textbooks in mathematics education. While Merttens herself had overseen the creation of textbook schemes, she resisted the notion that teachers should follow textbooks slavishly. Effective mathematics teaching, she argued, requires professional judgment—adapting to children's responses, seizing teachable moments, and differentiating based on ongoing assessment.

## Teaching Primary Mathematics: A Problem-Solving Approach

### The 1987 Textbook

Merttens' influence on primary mathematics teacher education was established early through her 1987 book *Teaching Primary Mathematics*, part of the Teaching Matters series published by Hodder Arnold. This text became essential reading for primary teacher trainees and practising teachers seeking to develop their mathematics teaching. Its subtitle—*A Problem-Solving and Investigatory Approach*—announced its distinctive orientation clearly.

The book was structured around practical suggestions for activities and games enabling teachers to cover all areas of the mathematics curriculum. Rather than presenting abstract methodology, Merttens provided concrete classroom ideas that teachers could implement immediately while developing their understanding of underlying principles.

## Pedagogical Philosophy: Key Themes

### Conceptual Understanding Over Procedural Fluency

A consistent theme across Merttens' work is the prioritisation of conceptual understanding over mere procedural fluency. She has consistently argued that children who can execute mathematical procedures without understanding why they work have limited mathematical capability.

This philosophy manifests in her support for teaching approaches that make mathematical structures visible and meaningful. Manipulatives, visual representations, and real-world contexts are not merely motivational devices but essential tools for developing understanding.

### The Centrality of Problem-Solving

Problem-solving, for Merttens, is not merely an application of learned mathematics but the primary context for mathematical learning itself. Children develop mathematical understanding by grappling with problems that require them to apply, combine, and extend their knowledge in unfamiliar situations.

### Parent Partnership in Mathematics Education

The IMPACT project's commitment to parental involvement reflects Merttens' broader belief that mathematics education extends beyond the classroom. Parents are children's first and most enduring educators, and their influence on mathematical attitudes and attainment is profound.

### Teacher Professionalism and Practical Support

Throughout her career, Merttens has combined respect for teacher professionalism with recognition that teachers need practical support to implement effective practice. She has resisted approaches that prescribe teaching methods in detail, trusting teachers to make professional judgments about their particular contexts.

## Influence and Legacy

Ruth Merttens' contribution to primary mathematics education spans research, publication, resource development, and policy critique. Her work has touched thousands of schools and millions of children through the resources she has created and the teachers she has influenced. The IMPACT project established a model for parental involvement that continues to inform practice. The Hamilton Trust materials provide daily support for teachers seeking to implement problem-solving approaches. The Abacus scheme offers a comprehensive curriculum programme used internationally.

Beyond these specific contributions, Merttens has been a consistent voice for an approach to mathematics education that values conceptual understanding, celebrates diversity in children's thinking, and respects the professionalism of teachers. Her critique of Shanghai-style teaching and her advocacy for problem-based learning have contributed to ongoing debates about the purposes and methods of primary mathematics education. For teachers, researchers, and policymakers seeking to understand effective primary mathematics pedagogy, Merttens' work remains essential reading.
