# Mike Askew: Transforming Primary Mathematics Education

## Biography and Academic Career

Mike Askew is one of the most influential figures in primary mathematics education over the past three decades. Currently Distinguished Professor of Mathematics Education at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, Askew has held professorships at three continents' leading institutions: King's College London, Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and his current position in South Africa.

Before entering academia, Askew was a primary school teacher, grounding his theoretical work in practical classroom experience. This practitioner background has shaped his research agenda, ensuring that his scholarly contributions remain deeply connected to the realities of classroom practice. In addition to his academic roles, Askew was a founding director of BEAM Education, a publishing house specialising in producing support materials and professional development resources for teachers of primary mathematics. BEAM (Be A Mathematician) became a significant force in shaping primary mathematics teaching in the United Kingdom throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.

Askew's career has been marked by a consistent commitment to making mathematics accessible, meaningful, and enjoyable for all learners. His teaching, speaking, and research are concerned with making mathematics a creative endeavour that helps learners understand more about themselves as well as the world around them. This philosophical stance—that mathematics education serves broader humanistic purposes beyond mere technical competence—permeates all his work.

## The Effective Teachers of Numeracy Study (1995-1996)

### Overview and Methodology

Askew's most influential contribution to mathematics education research came through the Effective Teachers of Numeracy study, conducted between 1995 and 1996 at King's College London. This landmark research, commissioned by the Teacher Training Agency (TTA), represented one of the most comprehensive investigations into what makes primary mathematics teaching effective. The research team, led by Askew alongside Margaret Brown, Valerie Rhodes, Dylan Wiliam, and David Johnson, examined the beliefs, practices, and pupil outcomes of teachers identified as highly effective in developing numeracy.

The study employed a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of pupil attainment gains with detailed qualitative observation of classroom practices. Researchers identified teachers whose pupils made significantly greater gains in numeracy assessments than would be predicted by prior attainment and socioeconomic factors. These "highly effective" teachers were then observed and interviewed extensively to understand the relationship between their beliefs about mathematics teaching and their classroom practices.

### The Three Belief Orientations

The Effective Teachers of Numeracy study identified three distinct orientations towards mathematics teaching, each characterised by a coherent set of beliefs about how children learn mathematics and the role of the teacher:

#### The Connectionist Orientation

Connectionist teachers believe that pupils learn most effectively when they are encouraged to develop their own mental strategies for calculating, whilst also being taught effective methods explicitly. These teachers place strong emphasis on establishing connections within mathematics—between different mathematical ideas, between symbols and representations, and between mathematical procedures and conceptual understanding.

Key characteristics of the connectionist orientation include:
- Belief that most pupils are able to learn mathematics given appropriate teaching
- Explicit introduction of mental calculation strategies alongside opportunities for pupils to develop their own approaches
- Emphasis on making connections between different aspects of mathematics
- View of the teacher as a facilitator who helps pupils make sense of mathematics rather than simply transmitting procedures
- Attention to both pupils' understanding and the development of efficient strategies

Connectionist teachers frequently use pupils' own methods as starting points for discussion, helping the class explore why different strategies work and which might be most efficient in different contexts. They value both procedural fluency and conceptual understanding, seeing these as mutually reinforcing rather than in tension.

#### The Transmission Orientation

Transmission-oriented teachers believe that mathematics learning primarily occurs through clear demonstration and explanation of standard procedures by the teacher, followed by repeated practice by pupils until mastery is achieved. This orientation places greater emphasis on teaching than on learning, with the teacher positioned as the expert who must transmit mathematical knowledge to learners.

Characteristics of the transmission orientation include:
- Belief that mathematical ability is largely fixed and that some pupils naturally find mathematics more difficult than others
- Emphasis on teacher demonstration of standard methods followed by pupil practice
- View of mathematical ideas as discrete packages of knowledge to be delivered sequentially
- Focus on correct answers and efficient procedures over understanding why methods work
- Preference for whole-class teaching with limited differentiation

While transmission-oriented teachers often demonstrate high levels of mathematical subject knowledge and clear explanations, the study found that this orientation was less consistently associated with high pupil gains than the connectionist orientation. The focus on teaching procedures without necessarily developing understanding sometimes left pupils unable to apply their knowledge flexibly to new problems.

#### The Discovery Orientation

Discovery-oriented teachers believe that mathematics learning happens most effectively when pupils are given opportunities to discover mathematical relationships and procedures for themselves, often through practical activities and exploration. These teachers emphasise pupils' active engagement and individual construction of meaning over teacher direction.

Characteristics of the discovery orientation include:
- Belief that pupils must be developmentally ready to learn particular mathematical ideas
- Emphasis on practical apparatus, real-world contexts, and play-based learning
- Preference for individual or small-group activities over whole-class teaching
- View of the teacher as provider of resources and opportunities rather than explicit instructor
- Concern that too much teacher direction inhibits pupils' natural mathematical development

Discovery-oriented teachers often create rich mathematical environments filled with practical resources and opportunities for exploration. However, the study found that without careful teacher intervention to help pupils make explicit connections and develop efficient strategies, discovery approaches sometimes resulted in pupils remaining dependent on informal counting methods rather than progressing to more sophisticated mental calculation strategies.

### Key Findings on Teacher Effectiveness

The Effective Teachers of Numeracy study revealed that teachers' beliefs were more strongly associated with pupil gains than any other measured factor, including teachers' mathematical qualifications, years of experience, or the specific teaching materials used. Highly effective teachers were distributed across all three orientations, but the connectionist orientation showed the strongest and most consistent association with high pupil gains.

Critically, the study found that highly effective teachers were not simply those with the strongest mathematical subject knowledge. Rather, effectiveness was associated with how teachers used their knowledge—whether they could connect mathematical ideas, understand pupils' thinking, and make appropriate pedagogical decisions in the moment. This insight challenged prevailing assumptions about teacher preparation and professional development, suggesting that developing pedagogical content knowledge—knowing how to teach mathematics—was at least as important as developing pure subject knowledge.

## The Leverhulme Numeracy Research Programme (1997-2002)

### Programme Overview

Following the success of the Effective Teachers of Numeracy study, Askew served as deputy director of the Leverhulme Numeracy Research Programme, a five-year longitudinal study funded by the Leverhulme Trust. This ambitious programme examined children's learning of number and the factors affecting it from age 5 to age 11, coinciding with the introduction and early years of England's National Numeracy Strategy.

The programme comprised multiple linked research projects:
- A large-scale longitudinal survey tracking two cohorts of children through 40 primary schools
- Detailed case studies of individual children's mathematical development
- Investigations into the role of teaching, curriculum, and school organisation in promoting numeracy
- Studies of low attainment and the factors associated with it
- Analysis of the implementation and effects of the National Numeracy Strategy

### Investigating Low Attainment

One significant strand of the Leverhulme Programme focused on understanding low attainment in numeracy. Askew and colleagues examined why some children struggled to make progress despite apparently appropriate teaching. Their research challenged deficit views of low-attaining children, instead identifying systemic and pedagogical factors that contributed to difficulties.

Key insights from this work included:
- The identification of "counting trap" children who remained dependent on counting strategies long after peers had developed more efficient calculation methods
- Recognition that the same teaching approaches could have different effects on different learners
- Understanding of how children's early experiences with number shaped their subsequent mathematical trajectories
- Analysis of how school and classroom organisational factors could either support or inhibit progress for vulnerable learners

### Impact on National Policy

The Leverhulme Programme's timing allowed researchers to document and analyse the introduction of England's National Numeracy Strategy in 1999. Askew and colleagues were able to examine how this major systemic reform affected teaching practices and pupil outcomes. Their research provided important evidence about both the benefits and limitations of centralised curriculum guidance and prescribed teaching approaches.

The programme's findings informed ongoing refinement of the National Numeracy Strategy and contributed to broader debates about mathematics education policy. Askew's role in synthesising and communicating research findings to policymakers and practitioners helped bridge the gap between academic research and classroom practice.

## Key Publications and Their Contributions

### Transforming Primary Mathematics (2012)

Askew's book *Transforming Primary Mathematics: Understanding Classroom Tasks, Tools and Talk* represents his most comprehensive articulation of a connectionist approach to primary mathematics teaching. Published by Routledge in 2012, the book challenges readers to reconsider fundamental questions: What is good mathematics teaching? What is mathematics teaching good for? Who is mathematics teaching for?

The book explores three interconnected elements of mathematics teaching:

**Tasks**: Askew argues that the mathematical tasks we present to children profoundly shape what they learn. He distinguishes between exercises (repetitive practice of established procedures), problems (applications of known mathematics in new contexts), and investigations (open-ended explorations that may generate new mathematical understanding). Effective teaching, he argues, involves carefully selecting and sequencing tasks that build on pupils' prior knowledge whilst pushing them towards more sophisticated mathematical thinking.

**Tools**: Mathematical tools—including physical apparatus, diagrams, symbols, and calculators—mediate between learners and mathematical ideas. Askew examines how different tools make certain aspects of mathematics visible whilst potentially obscuring others. He argues for teaching that helps pupils make connections between different representations, rather than becoming dependent on particular tools.

**Talk**: Classroom discourse shapes mathematical learning. Askew analyses different patterns of classroom talk and their effects on pupil thinking. He advocates for dialogic teaching approaches that encourage pupils to articulate and justify their mathematical reasoning, rather than simply providing correct answers.

Throughout the book, Askew draws on sociocultural theory and complexity science to argue that mathematical learning cannot be reduced to simple input-output models. Instead, he presents mathematics teaching as an emergent, relational practice where learning arises through interaction between teachers, pupils, and mathematical ideas.

### Making Connections: Effective Teaching of Numeracy (2002)

This publication, produced through BEAM Education, translated insights from the Effective Teachers of Numeracy study into practical guidance for teachers. The book provides detailed guidance on developing mental calculation strategies, emphasising the importance of helping pupils see connections between different calculation methods and develop flexible approaches to computation.

Askew identifies six key mental strategies that effective teachers develop in pupils:
- **Bridging through ten**: Using the decade boundary as a stepping stone in addition and subtraction
- **Jump strategies**: Adding or subtracting the tens and ones separately
- **Doubling and halving**: Using known doubles facts to derive other calculations
- **Rounding and adjusting**: Compensating strategies for calculations near round numbers
- **Re-ordering**: Using the commutative property to simplify calculations
- **Linking addition and subtraction**: Understanding inverse relationships

The book provides guidance on how to introduce these strategies explicitly whilst also encouraging pupils to develop their own approaches and compare the efficiency of different methods.

### Raising Attainment in Primary Number Sense (2001)

Co-authored with Tamara Bibby and Margaret Brown, this BEAM publication focused specifically on the development of number sense in primary children. The authors traced progression from early counting strategies through to sophisticated mental calculation, identifying key milestones and common difficulties.

The book emphasised the importance of:
- Developing secure counting skills as a foundation for calculation
- Recognising when children are ready to progress from counting to derived fact strategies
- Providing appropriate challenges that stretch children without overwhelming them
- Creating classroom cultures where mathematical thinking is valued and discussed

## Pedagogical Approaches and Classroom Applications

### Developing Mental Calculation Strategies

A consistent theme throughout Askew's work is the importance of developing flexible mental calculation strategies rather than relying on standard written algorithms. He argues that mental mathematics is not merely a precursor to written calculation but a valuable competence in its own right that supports mathematical reasoning and problem-solving.

Askew advocates for teaching that:
- Makes mental strategies explicit through modelling and discussion
- Encourages pupils to share and compare their methods
- Helps pupils select appropriate strategies for particular calculations
- Develops number sense and estimation skills alongside exact calculation

He cautions against premature introduction of formal written algorithms, arguing that children who develop secure mental strategies first are better positioned to understand why written methods work when they are introduced later.

### The Role of Mathematical Discussion

Askew places significant emphasis on the role of talk in developing mathematical understanding. Drawing on the work of Robin Alexander and others, he advocates for dialogic teaching approaches in mathematics lessons.

Key elements of dialogic mathematics teaching include:
- **Collective understanding**: Treating the class as a community engaged in shared mathematical inquiry
- **Reciprocity**: Genuine exchange of ideas between teacher and pupils, rather than teacher-dominated questioning
- **Supportiveness**: Creating classroom environments where pupils feel safe to express tentative ideas and partial understandings
- **Cumulative building**: Connecting contributions to build coherent mathematical arguments
- **Purposefulness**: Maintaining clear mathematical goals whilst remaining responsive to pupils' thinking

Askew provides practical guidance on how to move beyond Initiation-Response-Evaluation (IRE) patterns of classroom talk towards more genuinely dialogic interactions.

### Addressing Misconceptions

Throughout his work, Askew demonstrates awareness of common mathematical misconceptions and the importance of addressing them directly. Rather than viewing misconceptions as errors to be corrected, he sees them as valuable windows into children's thinking that can inform teaching.

Key insights include:
- Understanding that many misconceptions are intelligent attempts to make sense of mathematics based on limited experience
- Recognising that simply telling children they are wrong is rarely effective
- Using misconceptions as starting points for discussion and exploration
- Designing tasks that surface misconceptions so they can be addressed explicitly

### Differentiation and Inclusion

Askew's research consistently emphasises that effective mathematics teaching must address the needs of all learners. His work on the Leverhulme Programme particularly highlighted the dangers of low expectations and the importance of providing appropriate challenge for all pupils.

He advocates for differentiation strategies that:
- Provide access to the same mathematical ideas for all pupils, rather than different curricula for different groups
- Use purposeful tasks that can be approached at different levels of sophistication
- Support struggling learners through careful scaffolding without removing mathematical challenge
- Extend more confident learners through depth of thinking rather than acceleration through content

## Influence on UK Mathematics Education

### Contribution to the National Numeracy Strategy

Askew's research significantly influenced the development and implementation of England's National Numeracy Strategy (NNS), introduced in 1999. The Effective Teachers of Numeracy study provided much of the evidence base for the strategy's emphasis on mental calculation, whole-class interactive teaching, and making connections within mathematics.

Askew himself contributed directly to NNS materials, helping shape guidance on teaching calculation strategies and lesson structures. His influence can be seen in:
- The three-part lesson structure (mental/oral starter, main activity, plenary)
- Emphasis on developing mental strategies before written methods
- Focus on direct, interactive teaching rather than individualised seatwork
- Attention to making mathematical connections explicit

### Professional Development and Teacher Education

Through BEAM Education, his numerous publications, and his academic roles, Askew has influenced mathematics teacher education across the UK and internationally. His work has shaped:
- Initial teacher training programmes, particularly in developing pedagogical content knowledge
- Continuing professional development programmes for practising teachers
- The content and structure of published mathematics schemes and resources
- Research methodology in mathematics education, particularly mixed-methods approaches combining quantitative and qualitative investigation

Askew served as President of the Mathematical Association (2018-2019), one of the UK's leading professional organisations for mathematics educators, further extending his influence on policy and practice debates.

### International Influence

Whilst Askew's research has been primarily conducted in English contexts, his influence extends internationally. His current position in South Africa reflects growing recognition of his expertise in supporting mathematics education improvement in diverse contexts. In South Africa, he has worked on initiatives to improve primary mathematics performance, bringing insights from UK research to bear on very different systemic challenges.

His work has been particularly influential in:
- Australia, through his professorship at Monash University and ongoing Adjunct Professor role
- South Africa, through his current research and development work
- European contexts, through keynote addresses and collaborative research projects
- International curriculum development, through consultancy on mathematics framework design

## Theoretical Contributions

### Sociocultural Perspectives on Mathematics Learning

Askew's later work increasingly draws on sociocultural theory, particularly the work of Vygotsky and subsequent cultural-historical activity theorists. He argues that mathematical learning cannot be understood purely in individual cognitive terms but must be seen as a social and cultural process.

Key theoretical contributions include:
- Understanding mathematical tools as mediators of thinking, not merely teaching aids
- Recognition that classroom communities develop collective mathematical practices
- Analysis of how mathematical identities are constructed through classroom participation
- Attention to the cultural resources children bring to mathematics learning

### Complexity and Emergence

In *Transforming Primary Mathematics*, Askew draws on complexity science to argue against reductionist approaches to mathematics education. He suggests that classrooms are complex adaptive systems where learning emerges from interactions between multiple elements—teachers, pupils, tasks, tools, and mathematical ideas—in ways that cannot be fully predicted or controlled.

This theoretical stance has practical implications:
- Recognition that teaching involves managing uncertainty rather than following prescribed scripts
- Valuing teacher professional judgment in responding to emerging classroom situations
- Understanding curriculum implementation as adaptation rather than fidelity to external specifications
- Accepting that mathematical learning is often non-linear and unpredictable

## Critiques and Debates

### The Nature of Mathematical Ability

Askew's finding that connectionist teachers believe most pupils can learn mathematics given appropriate teaching challenges assumptions about fixed mathematical ability. However, this stance has been debated within the mathematics education community.

Some critics argue that:
- The connectionist orientation may underestimate the genuine difficulties some learners experience
- Emphasis on whole-class teaching may not adequately address the needs of learners with significant mathematical difficulties
- Beliefs about the malleability of mathematical ability must be balanced with recognition of individual differences

Askew's response has been to advocate for high expectations for all learners whilst also supporting teachers in developing the specialised knowledge needed to help struggling learners effectively.
