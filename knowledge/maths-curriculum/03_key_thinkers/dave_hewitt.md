# Dave Hewitt: Arbitrary and Necessary, Train Spotters, and the Economic Use of Classroom Time

**Biographical Overview**

Dave Hewitt is a prominent British mathematics educator and researcher currently based at Loughborough University's Mathematics Education Centre, where he established the mathematics teacher training course in 2014. Prior to this role, Hewitt worked extensively in schools and at the University of Birmingham, developing influential theoretical frameworks that have shaped contemporary understanding of mathematics pedagogy. His work is deeply influenced by the educational philosophy of Caleb Gattegno, particularly the distinction between memorisation and awareness, and the economic use of time in learning.

Hewitt's research centres on fundamental questions about the nature of mathematical knowledge and how it is acquired. His most significant contribution to the field is the "Arbitrary and Necessary" framework, a tripartite theoretical structure that provides teachers with a principled basis for deciding when to tell students information directly and when to allow them to discover mathematical relationships for themselves. This framework has profound implications for classroom practice, curriculum design, and the balance between teacher instruction and student exploration.

Beyond his theoretical work, Hewitt is also the developer of **Grid Algebra**, an innovative educational software tool designed to help students gain confidence with formal algebraic notation through a spatial, game-like interface. He has published extensively in leading mathematics education journals, including *For the Learning of Mathematics*, and his papers on arbitrary and necessary knowledge (published in three parts between 1999 and 2001) remain among the most cited works in the field.

Hewitt's influence extends through his teaching of pre-service and in-service teachers, his development of practical classroom resources, and his ongoing research into the nature of mathematical fluency and the role of subordination in developing skilled performance. His collaboration with Tom Francome produced the book *Practising Mathematics: Developing the Mathematician as Well as the Mathematics*, which translates his theoretical insights into practical activities for the classroom.

## The Arbitrary and Necessary Framework

### Origins and Theoretical Foundations

The arbitrary and necessary framework emerged from Hewitt's observation that mathematics teachers frequently struggle with a fundamental pedagogical dilemma: when is it appropriate to tell students information directly, and when should students be encouraged to discover mathematical relationships for themselves? Traditional approaches often swing between two extremes—either excessive direct instruction that reduces students to passive recipients of knowledge, or unfocused discovery learning where students may fail to encounter the mathematical ideas the teacher intends them to learn.

Hewitt's framework resolves this dilemma by recognising that not all mathematical knowledge is of the same kind. Some mathematical facts are **arbitrary**—they are conventions, definitions, or notations that could have been otherwise and which students cannot be expected to work out for themselves without being told. Other mathematical facts are **necessary**—they follow logically from definitions and relationships, and students can potentially become aware of these through appropriate mathematical activity.

This distinction has its philosophical roots in the work of Caleb Gattegno, who distinguished between knowledge that requires memorisation and knowledge that can be derived from awareness. Hewitt extends this distinction into a comprehensive pedagogical framework that provides clear guidance for teaching decisions. The framework also draws on constructivist understandings of learning, recognising that students must actively construct their mathematical understanding, while acknowledging that not all knowledge can be constructed without external input.

### Part 1: A Way of Viewing the Mathematics Curriculum

In the first paper of his trilogy, published in *For the Learning of Mathematics* in 1999, Hewitt establishes the foundational distinction between arbitrary and necessary mathematical knowledge. He argues that this distinction provides a principled basis for deciding when teachers need to tell students information and when they do not.

**Arbitrary knowledge**, Hewitt contends, exists in the realm of **memory**. It consists of names, labels, symbols, and conventions that could have been otherwise. For example, the fact that we use the symbol "+" to denote addition is arbitrary—mathematically, we could use any symbol. Similarly, the names given to geometric shapes, the notation for fractions, and the convention that there are 360 degrees in a full turn are all arbitrary from a mathematical perspective. Historically, there may be reasons for these conventions (the 360 degrees relates to Babylonian counting systems), but mathematically they could be different. Because students cannot work out arbitrary knowledge for themselves, Hewitt argues that teachers should simply tell students this information directly, without attempting to create artificial "discovery" activities.

**Necessary knowledge**, by contrast, exists in the realm of **awareness**. It consists of mathematical relationships and properties that follow necessarily from definitions and structures. For example, once we accept the definition of a triangle and the convention that a straight line represents 180 degrees, it necessarily follows that the interior angles of any plane triangle sum to 180 degrees. This is not a fact to be memorised but a relationship to be understood. Hewitt argues that teachers should create opportunities for students to become aware of necessary relationships through mathematical activity, rather than simply telling them the results.

Hewitt's crucial insight is that conflating these two types of knowledge leads to pedagogical confusion. When teachers treat arbitrary knowledge as if it were necessary, they waste time creating elaborate "discovery" activities for things students could never discover (like the name of the number "five"). When teachers treat necessary knowledge as if it were arbitrary, they reduce rich mathematical relationships to facts to be memorised, depriving students of the opportunity to develop genuine mathematical understanding.

### Part 2: Assisting Memory

The second paper in the trilogy, published in 2001, develops the implications of the framework for memory and recall. Hewitt observes that much mathematics teaching is concerned with helping students remember arbitrary information—formulas, notation, vocabulary, and procedures. Because this arbitrary information cannot be worked out from first principles, students must commit it to memory, and teachers must assist them in doing so.

Hewitt distinguishes between different types of memory assistance. At the most basic level, there is simple memorisation through repetition and rehearsal. However, Hewitt argues that more sophisticated approaches can make arbitrary information more memorable by connecting it to meaningful contexts or patterns. The key is recognising that arbitrary information, while not derivable mathematically, can still be organised and contextualised in ways that support recall.

For example, the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) is largely arbitrary—mathematicians could have agreed on different conventions. However, once students understand that the convention exists to ensure everyone interprets mathematical expressions in the same way, and once they have practised applying the convention in meaningful contexts, the arbitrary rule becomes embedded in a network of understanding that supports recall.

Hewitt also explores how the arbitrary and necessary framework relates to **working memory** and **cognitive load**. He suggests that when students are struggling to remember arbitrary information, their working memory is occupied with material that prevents them from attending to necessary mathematical relationships. By efficiently addressing arbitrary knowledge through direct instruction, teachers free up students' cognitive resources for the more important work of developing awareness of necessary mathematical relationships.

### Part 3: Educating Awareness

The third paper in the trilogy focuses on the educational implications of necessary knowledge. If necessary knowledge exists in the realm of awareness rather than memory, then teaching must focus on **educating awareness** rather than merely transmitting information. Hewitt draws heavily on Gattegno's notion that awareness is educated through encounter and attention, not through instruction.

Educating awareness requires carefully designed mathematical situations that bring necessary relationships into focus. Hewitt argues that this is not about "discovery learning" in the naive sense, where students are simply left to discover mathematics for themselves. Rather, it involves the teacher creating **structured encounters** with mathematical ideas, through which students can become aware of relationships that are necessarily true.

For example, rather than telling students that the angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees, a teacher might have students draw various triangles, measure their angles, and observe the pattern. The measurement activity is not about discovering the fact through empirical observation (which would actually be impossible, given the limitations of physical measurement). Rather, it is about creating a context in which students' awareness can be directed toward the necessary relationship.

Hewitt emphasises that educating awareness requires **time and depth**. Superficial encounters with mathematical ideas do not educate awareness effectively. Students need sustained engagement with mathematical situations, opportunities to encounter the same ideas in different contexts, and guidance in directing their attention to what is mathematically significant.

## Train Spotters' Paradise: Depth Over Superficiality

### The Problem of Pattern Spotting

One of Hewitt's most influential practical contributions is his critique of what he calls "pattern spotting" in mathematics education. In his 1992 article "Train Spotters' Paradise," published in *Mathematics Teaching*, Hewitt alerts educators to the limitations of a superficial approach to mathematical patterns and sequences.

The title references the hobby of train spotting, where enthusiasts collect sightings of different train types, often checking them off in a book. Hewitt observes that much mathematics teaching, particularly in the area of number sequences and patterns, resembles train spotting more than genuine mathematical thinking. Students are given sequences, asked to identify the pattern, and then rush on to the next sequence. The activity becomes about recognising and naming patterns rather than understanding the underlying mathematical structures.

Hewitt argues that this approach misses **the richness that can be gained by looking at a particular situation in some depth**, rather than looking at it superficially to get a result for a table and then rushing on to the next example. When students simply identify that a sequence is "the two times table" or "add three each time," they may be able to continue the sequence or find particular terms, but they have not necessarily engaged with the mathematical relationships involved.

### Mathematical Richness Through Depth

Hewitt advocates for an alternative approach where students spend extended time with particular mathematical situations, exploring them in depth from multiple angles. Rather than treating each sequence as a discrete item to be "spotted" and recorded, students should investigate the properties of sequences, the relationships between different representations, and the connections to other mathematical ideas.

For example, rather than simply identifying that a sequence of square numbers follows the pattern "add consecutive odd numbers," students might explore:
- The geometric representation of square numbers as actual squares
- The relationship between square numbers and rectangular numbers
- The algebraic structure (n²) and how it relates to the pattern of differences
- The connections to area and to quadratic relationships
- The appearance of square numbers in other mathematical contexts

This depth of exploration transforms pattern work from a superficial spotting activity into genuine mathematical investigation. Students develop not just the ability to continue sequences but an understanding of the mathematical structures that generate them.

### Implications for the Curriculum

Hewitt's critique has significant implications for curriculum design and classroom practice. It suggests that covering many topics superficially is less educationally valuable than covering fewer topics in depth. The pressure to "get through" the curriculum can lead to a train-spotting approach, where students encounter many mathematical ideas but understand few of them deeply.

The alternative is a curriculum structured around **key mathematical ideas** that are returned to repeatedly and explored from different angles. Rather than treating topics as boxes to be ticked, this approach recognises that genuine mathematical understanding develops through sustained engagement and the making of connections over time.

Hewitt's work on arbitrary and necessary knowledge connects to this critique. Superficial pattern spotting often involves treating necessary mathematical relationships as if they were arbitrary facts to be memorised ("this is the two times table"). In contrast, deep exploration educates awareness of the necessary relationships that generate patterns and sequences.

## Economic Use of Time and the Law of Economy

### Efficiency versus Economy

A central theme in Hewitt's work is the **economic use of time and effort** in mathematics education. In a 2023 podcast interview with Craig Barton, Hewitt distinguished between **efficiency** (doing things quickly) and **economy** (doing things with minimum effort). While these may seem similar, Hewitt argues that they can lead to very different educational outcomes.

Efficiency focuses on the short term: how quickly can students produce correct answers? An efficient approach might involve teaching students procedures to memorise and apply. In the short term, this can produce impressive results—students can answer questions correctly and appear to be making rapid progress.

Economy, by contrast, focuses on the long term: what is the minimum effort required for students to develop genuine mathematical understanding that will serve them well in the future? An economic approach might take more time initially, as students develop awareness of necessary relationships, but pays dividends later when students can apply their understanding flexibly to new situations without extensive additional instruction.

Hewitt argues that the "law of short-term success" often leads teachers to choose efficiency over economy. When students can be taught a procedure that enables them to answer questions correctly, it can be tempting to do so, especially when under pressure to demonstrate progress. However, this short-term efficiency often creates long-term problems, as students who have memorised procedures without understanding struggle to apply their knowledge in new contexts or retain it over time.

### The Subordination of Teaching to Learning

Hewitt's concept of **subordination** extends the principle of economic use of time into classroom practice. When a skill is subordinated, it is practised not for its own sake but in the service of some other goal. The skill becomes a means to an end rather than the end itself.

For example, rather than practising algebraic manipulation as an isolated skill, students might engage with Grid Algebra software where algebraic notation is the means for achieving spatial goals. The algebraic manipulation is subordinated to the game-like activity, but in the process, students develop fluency with formal notation. Because the algebraic work is embedded in a meaningful context, students are motivated to engage with it, and the practice feels purposeful rather than repetitive.

Hewitt argues that subordination is an economical approach because it achieves multiple educational goals simultaneously. Students develop technical skills while also engaging with mathematical meaning and purpose. The time spent practising skills is not additional to the time spent on mathematical thinking—it is integrated within it.

This connects to Hewitt's work on **mathematical fluency**. Rather than fluency being developed through isolated practice of component skills, Hewitt argues that fluency emerges from engagement with appropriately structured mathematical activities where skills are practised in subordination to meaningful goals.

### Grid Algebra: Subordination in Action

Hewitt's **Grid Algebra** software provides a concrete example of subordination and economic use of time in practice. The software presents a grid where numbers are arranged spatially, and users can perform operations by moving around the grid. Algebraic notation emerges naturally from the spatial operations—students need to write expressions to describe their movements and positions.

In Grid Algebra, the arbitrary elements of algebraic notation (the conventions for writing expressions, the order of operations, the meaning of symbols) are embedded in a meaningful context. Students learn these arbitrary conventions not through memorisation but through use. The notation is the means by which they achieve their spatial goals within the software.

At the same time, necessary mathematical relationships (the properties of operations, the structure of expressions, the equivalence of different algebraic forms) are brought into awareness through the constraints of the grid environment. Students encounter these relationships not as facts to be told but as features of the mathematical world they are exploring.

Research on Grid Algebra has shown that students who use the software develop confidence with formal algebraic notation more quickly than those following traditional instruction, while also developing deeper conceptual understanding. This demonstrates the economic principle: by structuring learning so that skills are subordinated to meaningful goals, more learning is achieved in the same amount of time.

## Pedagogical Implications and Classroom Applications

### When to Tell and When Not to Tell

Hewitt's framework provides clear guidance for one of teaching's most fundamental decisions: when to tell students information directly and when to let them work things out for themselves. The rule is simple but powerful: **tell students arbitrary knowledge, create opportunities for awareness of necessary knowledge**.

In practice, this means:
- **Tell** students the names of mathematical objects, the symbols used to represent operations, the conventions for writing expressions, and the procedures for using mathematical tools.
- **Do not tell** students mathematical relationships, properties, and patterns that they can become aware of through appropriate activity.

This does not mean that necessary knowledge should be left entirely to student discovery. Teachers play a crucial role in **structuring encounters** with necessary relationships, guiding attention, and creating contexts where awareness can develop. The teacher's role shifts from transmitter of information to designer of mathematical experiences and director of attention.

### The Role of Practice

Hewitt's work has significant implications for how we think about practice in mathematics education. Traditional approaches often involve extensive practice of isolated skills, based on the assumption that fluency develops through repetition. Hewitt argues for a different conception of practice, one that is **embedded in meaningful mathematical activity**.

In this view, practice is not separate from learning but integral to it. Students practise skills as they engage with mathematical problems and investigations. The practice is **subordinated** to the mathematical goals of the activity, making it more purposeful and engaging.

Hewitt and Francome's book *Practising Mathematics* provides numerous examples of activities where practice is integrated with mathematical thinking. Rather than worksheets of repetitive calculations, the book offers tasks where students must use mathematical skills to achieve interesting goals—solving puzzles, exploring patterns, making conjectures, and proving results.

### Supporting All Learners

The arbitrary and necessary framework has implications for supporting students with different needs and prior attainment. Students who struggle with mathematics often have particular difficulty with arbitrary knowledge—they may not have memorised basic facts, may be unfamiliar with notation, or may be confused by conventions. Because arbitrary knowledge cannot be worked out, these gaps create barriers to accessing mathematical activity.

Hewitt's framework suggests that teachers should be explicit and direct about arbitrary knowledge, ensuring that all students have the basic information they need to engage with mathematical activity. At the same time, the framework suggests that necessary knowledge should be accessible to all students through appropriate activity, since it does not depend on memorisation but on awareness.

This has implications for differentiation. Rather than giving different students different mathematics based on prior attainment, Hewitt's approach suggests ensuring all students have the arbitrary knowledge they need and then engaging all students with the same rich mathematical activities that educate awareness.
