# John Mason: Mathematical Thinking and the Structure of Attention

## Overview

John Mason is one of the most influential mathematics educators of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Emeritus Professor at The Open University and Senior Research Fellow at the University of Oxford's Department of Education, Mason has spent over four decades developing frameworks that illuminate how mathematical thinking develops and how teachers can foster it in learners. His work bridges the gap between research and practice, offering teachers practical tools grounded in rigorous theoretical understanding.

Mason's influence extends across the United Kingdom and internationally, through his seminal publications, his founding role in the Open University Centre for Mathematics Education, and his ongoing work with teachers through the "Promoting Mathematical Thinking" initiative. His central insight—that mathematical thinking can be taught and that learners possess natural powers that can be harnessed for mathematical learning—has transformed how mathematics education is conceptualised and enacted in classrooms.

## Biographical Background and Career Trajectory

### Early Academic Foundation

John Mason's academic journey began in combinatorial geometry, the field in which he earned his PhD. This mathematical background proved foundational to his later educational work, providing him with deep insight into the nature of mathematical thinking from the inside. Unlike many mathematics educators who approach the field from a purely pedagogical or psychological perspective, Mason's grounding in advanced mathematics allowed him to understand the subject's epistemological demands intimately.

### The Open University and Centre for Mathematics Education

Mason spent forty years at The Open University, where he became a founding member and sometime director of the Centre for Mathematics Education. The Open University's mission—to make higher education accessible to adults studying at a distance—proved an ideal environment for Mason to develop his thinking about how mathematical understanding can be fostered outside traditional classroom settings. The university's innovative use of media, including radio, television, and audio materials, influenced Mason's later work on technology and mathematics education.

During his tenure at the Open University, Mason authored or co-authored dozens of books, pamphlets, and teaching materials that reached thousands of teachers and learners. The Centre for Mathematics Education became a hub for research and professional development, with Mason's work at its centre.

### Later Career at Oxford

Following his retirement from the Open University, Mason took up a position as Senior Research Fellow at the University of Oxford's Department of Education. At Oxford, he has continued his research into the structure of attention in mathematics teaching and learning, while also working directly with pre-service and in-service teachers. His current research focuses on how teachers can develop their awareness of learners' mathematical thinking and use this awareness to inform their pedagogical decisions.

Mason is also an Honorary Fellow of both the British Society for Research into Learning Mathematics (BSRLM) and the Association of Teachers of Mathematics (ATM), reflecting his standing within the UK mathematics education community. He is a long-standing member of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA).

## Core Theoretical Contributions

### Thinking Mathematically: The Foundational Framework

Mason's most influential contribution to mathematics education is the framework developed in *Thinking Mathematically*, first published in 1982 with co-authors Leone Burton and Kaye Stacey, and revised in a second edition in 2010. This book represents a landmark in mathematics education research, offering a systematic analysis of the processes that underpin mathematical thinking.

#### The Three-Phase Model of Mathematical Activity

At the heart of *Thinking Mathematically* is a three-phase model of mathematical work:

**Entry Phase**: This initial phase involves getting started on a problem. Mason emphasises that learners often struggle to begin, not because they lack knowledge or ability, but because they have not yet engaged their natural powers of mathematical thinking. The entry phase involves recognising that a problem is mathematical, understanding what is being asked, and making initial attempts at engagement.

**Attack Phase**: Once engaged with a problem, learners move into the attack phase, where they actively work on finding a solution. Mason identifies various strategies that mathematicians use during this phase, including specialising (trying specific cases), generalising (looking for patterns), conjecturing (making informed guesses), and justifying (seeking to convince themselves and others).

**Review Phase**: Perhaps most distinctively, Mason emphasises the importance of the review phase—reflecting on what has been learned, considering how the approach might apply to other problems, and consolidating understanding. This metacognitive component is often neglected in mathematics teaching, where the focus tends to be on obtaining correct answers rather than on developing deeper understanding.

#### Specialising and Generalising as Core Processes

Mason identifies specialising and generalising as the fundamental dialectic of mathematical thinking. Specialising involves examining particular cases to gain insight into structure; generalising involves recognising patterns and expressing them in general form. These processes are not sequential but interactive—specialising informs generalising, and generalising guides further specialising.

For Mason, these processes are not merely techniques to be taught but natural human powers that can be harnessed for mathematical learning. Every child who learns language demonstrates extraordinary powers of pattern recognition and generalisation; Mason's pedagogical approach seeks to redirect these powers toward mathematical ends.

### The Structure of Attention

Mason's later work has increasingly focused on what he calls the "structure of attention"—how learners direct their attention when engaged with mathematical tasks and how teachers can influence this direction. This framework represents a sophisticated development of his earlier thinking, grounded in phenomenological inquiry and influenced by his reading in psychology and philosophy.

#### Forms of Attention

Mason identifies several distinct forms that attention can take in mathematical activity:

**Holding Wholes (Gazing)**: This form of attention involves taking in the overall structure of a situation without focusing on details. It is the attentional stance that allows mathematicians to perceive pattern and structure before they can articulate it explicitly.

**Discerning Details**: At this level, attention focuses on particular elements within the whole. The learner notices specific features, distinctions, or relationships that become objects of conscious awareness.

**Recognising Relationships**: Attention shifts from individual details to the relationships between them. The learner perceives how elements connect, compare, or contrast with each other.

**Perceiving Properties**: At this level, attention focuses on properties that are independent of particular instances. The learner recognises that certain characteristics belong to a class of objects, not just to specific examples.

**Reasoning on the Basis of Identified Properties**: The most sophisticated form of attention involves working with properties as objects of thought in themselves, independent of any particular instantiation.

#### The Delicate Shift of Attention

Mason describes mathematical abstraction as a "delicate shift of attention"—a movement from attending to particular objects to attending to the relationships between them, and ultimately to the properties that govern those relationships. This shift is not automatic but requires careful pedagogical support. Teachers must design tasks and orchestrate classroom interactions in ways that make these shifts possible and natural for learners.

### The Discipline of Noticing

Closely related to his work on attention is Mason's concept of the "discipline of noticing"—a systematic approach to developing professional awareness. For Mason, expertise in teaching is fundamentally about what teachers notice in the complexity of classroom interaction and how they respond to what they notice.

#### Noticing in the Moment

Mason distinguishes between retrospective reflection on teaching and noticing in the moment. While both are valuable, it is noticing in the heat of classroom interaction that enables teachers to respond flexibly and effectively to learner thinking. This requires developing what Mason calls " educated awareness"—a heightened sensitivity to the mathematical possibilities in learner contributions.

#### Marking and Recording

The discipline of noticing involves marking significant moments during teaching (noting to oneself that something noteworthy has occurred) and recording them later for reflection. Over time, this practice builds a repertoire of noticed moments that inform future teaching. Mason emphasises that this is not merely a matter of accumulating techniques but of developing one's awareness so that fresh possibilities for action become available in the moment.

## Pedagogical Frameworks and Classroom Applications

### Tasks and Pedagogical Choices

Mason's approach to task design is governed by the principle that any task can be seen as merely one example of a rich domain of similar tasks. The art of pedagogy lies in exploiting the potential of tasks to engage learners' natural powers of mathematical thinking.

#### The Role of Examples

Mason has written extensively on the pedagogical use of examples. He distinguishes between different types of examples and their roles in learning:

**Examples of**: Illustrations of a concept or technique, serving to instantiate general principles.

**Examples for**: Tasks designed to prepare learners for upcoming learning, activating prior knowledge and creating readiness.

**Examples by**: Situations in which learners generate their own examples, thereby demonstrating and developing their understanding.

This framework helps teachers make principled decisions about when to provide examples and when to invite learners to generate their own.

#### Variation Theory and Dimension of Possible Variation

Drawing on his collaboration with Anne Watson and others, Mason has developed the concept of "dimensions of possible variation"—the aspects of a mathematical situation that can be changed while preserving its essential structure. Task design involves systematically varying these dimensions to help learners discern what is essential and what is arbitrary.

For example, when teaching algebraic factorisation, a teacher might vary the coefficients, the number of terms, or the presence of common factors, while keeping the structure of the expression constant. This systematic variation helps learners see beyond the surface features of particular examples to the underlying mathematical structure.

### Mathematical Powers and Themes

Mason identifies a set of "natural powers" that learners bring to mathematical activity and a set of "mathematical themes" that recur across the curriculum. Effective teaching harnesses these powers and makes these themes explicit.

#### Natural Powers

- **Imagining and Expressing**: The power to form mental images and to express them in words, symbols, or diagrams.
- **Specialising and Generalising**: The power to move between particular cases and general statements.
- **Conjecturing and Convincing**: The power to make informed guesses and to seek to justify them.
- **Organising and Characterising**: The power to classify and to identify defining properties.
- **Restricting and Extending**: The power to consider special cases and to generalise to broader contexts.

#### Mathematical Themes

- **Doing and Undoing**: The relationship between a mathematical operation and its inverse, a theme that recurs from early arithmetic through to advanced calculus.
- **Invariance in the Midst of Change**: The identification of what remains constant as other elements vary, a fundamental mathematical strategy.
- **Freedom and Constraint**: The interplay between the degrees of freedom in a mathematical situation and the constraints that govern it.

### The Teacher's Role: Being Mathematical With and In Front of Learners

Mason places particular emphasis on the teacher's own mathematical being. His plenary address to the 2015 ATM Conference captured this in its title: "It's not what you believe, that makes your teaching effective, nor is it what you know, nor even what you do, though these all make a contribution. What really matters is your entire mathematical being, your whole self in relation to students, to mathematics and to the institution."

This perspective challenges teachers to develop their own mathematical thinking, not merely as preparation for teaching but as a way of being in the classroom. When teachers engage authentically with mathematical problems alongside their learners, they model the processes of mathematical thinking and create a classroom culture in which such thinking is valued and nurtured.

## Influence on UK Mathematics Education Policy and Practice

### Influence on National Curriculum and Assessment

Mason's work has influenced the development of the National Curriculum for Mathematics in England, particularly in the emphasis on mathematical processes and problem-solving. The current curriculum's focus on fluency, reasoning, and problem-solving reflects Mason's insistence that mathematical learning must go beyond procedural competence to develop genuine mathematical thinking.

### Professional Development and Teacher Education

Through the Open University and his ongoing work with teachers, Mason has influenced the professional development of thousands of mathematics educators. His materials, particularly those developed for distance learning, have reached teachers in contexts where traditional professional development is difficult to access. The discipline of noticing has become an influential framework for professional learning, informing approaches to lesson study, coaching, and reflective practice.

### Research Networks and Communities

Mason has been a central figure in UK mathematics education research networks, particularly through the British Society for Research into Learning Mathematics (BSRLM) and the Psychology of Mathematics Education (PME) international group. His work has influenced generations of researchers who have taken up and developed his frameworks in their own work.

### Impact on Classroom Practice

Beyond research and policy, Mason's influence is felt in classrooms across the United Kingdom. Teachers who have encountered his work report changes in how they design tasks, how they interact with learners, and how they conceptualise their role. The emphasis on mathematical thinking as teachable, on the importance of the review phase, and on the teacher's own mathematical being has shifted practice in countless mathematics classrooms.

## Connections to Other Key Thinkers

### Leone Burton and Kaye Stacey

Mason's collaboration with Burton and Stacey on *Thinking Mathematically* produced a synthesis of their complementary perspectives. Burton brought expertise in gender and mathematics education, while Stacey contributed her work on mathematical reasoning and problem-solving. The book represents a genuinely collaborative intellectual achievement.

### Anne Watson

Mason's collaboration with Anne Watson, particularly on *Questions and Prompts for Mathematical Thinking* and work on variation theory, has been highly influential. Watson's expertise in classroom practice complemented Mason's theoretical frameworks, producing work that is both intellectually rigorous and practically applicable.

### Guy Brousseau and French Didactics

Mason's work shows the influence of French didactique des mathématiques, particularly the theory of didactical situations developed by Guy Brousseau. The concept of a "didactical contract"—the implicit understandings between teacher and learner about what is expected—has informed Mason's thinking about classroom interaction.

### Hans Freudenthal

The influence of Hans Freudenthal's "didactical phenomenology" is evident in Mason's approach to mathematics education. Like Freudenthal, Mason believes that mathematics should be learned through engagement with phenomena that are meaningful to learners, and that the historical development of mathematical ideas can inform their pedagogical sequencing.

## Practical Applications for Classroom Teachers

### Implementing the Three-Phase Model

Teachers can apply Mason's three-phase model by explicitly attending to each phase in their lesson planning:

**Entry**: Design tasks that offer multiple points of entry, allowing learners with different prior knowledge to engage. Use prompts that activate relevant prior learning without prescribing a solution method.

**Attack**: Provide time and space for learners to grapple with problems. Resist the temptation to rescue learners too quickly. Instead, ask questions that support their thinking without directing it.

**Review**: Build in time for reflection at the end of lessons. Ask learners not just what they learned but how they learned it. Make connections to other problems and to the broader mathematical landscape.

### Developing the Discipline of Noticing

Teachers can develop their capacity for noticing by:

- Keeping a professional journal in which they record significant moments from their teaching
- Engaging in lesson study or collaborative observation with colleagues, focusing on learner thinking
- Using video recordings of their teaching to notice what they missed in the moment
- Developing a shared language with colleagues for describing what they notice

### Harnessing Natural Powers

Mason's framework of natural powers provides a lens for task design and lesson evaluation:

- Does this task invite learners to use their power of specialising?
- Are there opportunities for learners to conjecture and convince?
- How can I help learners organise and characterise the mathematical objects they are working with?
- Am I teaching in a way that respects and develops learners' natural mathematical powers?

## Critiques and Debates

### Relationship to Cognitive Science

Some researchers have questioned the relationship between Mason's phenomenologically-based frameworks and the findings of cognitive science. While Mason's work is grounded in careful observation of mathematical activity, it does not always align with cognitive models of mathematical processing. Defenders of Mason's approach argue that phenomenological inquiry offers insights that complement rather than contradict cognitive research.

### Implementation Challenges

The practical implementation of Mason's frameworks presents challenges. The discipline of noticing, in particular, requires sustained professional development and a supportive school culture. Critics have noted that Mason's work, while theoretically rich, can be difficult for busy teachers to translate into daily practice without substantial support.

### Assessment Tensions

There is an ongoing tension between Mason's emphasis on mathematical thinking and the demands of high-stakes assessment. While the current National Curriculum and GCSE embrace problem-solving, the pressures of examination preparation can lead to teaching that focuses on technique rather than the development of genuine mathematical thinking. Mason's work offers a principled basis for resisting this pressure, but implementing it requires institutional support and courageous leadership.
