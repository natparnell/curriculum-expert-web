# KS1 and KS2 Mathematics Assessment

This knowledge file provides a comprehensive overview of assessment practices in primary mathematics across Key Stages 1 and 2, covering statutory requirements, teacher assessment frameworks, formative and summative approaches, and pedagogical strategies for effective assessment.

## Statutory Assessment Landscape

### Current Statutory Requirements

The statutory assessment landscape for primary mathematics has undergone significant changes in recent years. As of the academic year 2023 to 2024, Key Stage 1 (KS1) national curriculum tests in English reading and mathematics became optional rather than mandatory. This policy change was implemented to reduce assessment burden on primary schools while maintaining rigorous standards.

Key Stage 2 (KS2) tests, commonly known as SATs, remain statutory for all eligible pupils. These tests are administered in May each year and cover mathematics, English reading, and English grammar, punctuation, and spelling. The mathematics tests at KS2 comprise three papers: one arithmetic paper and two reasoning papers.

The Multiplication Tables Check (MTC) was introduced as a statutory assessment for Year 4 pupils from the 2021/22 academic year. This computer-based check assesses pupils' fluency in recalling multiplication tables up to 12 × 12, with particular focus on the 6, 7, 8, 9, and 12 times tables which Ofsted research suggests are the most challenging.

### The Reception Baseline Assessment

The Reception Baseline Assessment (RBA) was introduced in September 2021 as a statutory assessment for all children in reception within the first six weeks of starting school. This short, interactive assessment focuses on early mathematics, literacy, communication, and language. The RBA provides a starting point for measuring progress from reception to Year 6, replacing the previous KS1 to KS2 progress measures.

The RBA is administered one-to-one by the child's teacher and takes approximately 20 minutes. Tasks include counting objects, recognising numerals, and solving simple problems. Results are not published but are used to calculate school-level progress measures.

## Key Stage 1 Assessment Framework

### Optional Testing Arrangements

While KS1 tests are no longer mandatory, many schools continue to use them as part of their assessment portfolio. The Standards and Testing Agency (STA) provides optional tests in English reading and mathematics that schools may administer during May. These tests follow the same format as the previous statutory assessments:

- **English reading**: Two papers (Paper 1: lower demand, Paper 2: higher demand)
- **Mathematics**: Two papers (Paper 1: arithmetic, Paper 2: reasoning)

Schools choosing to use these optional tests must follow the STA administration guidance to ensure validity and reliability of results.

### Teacher Assessment Frameworks

The non-statutory teacher assessment frameworks for KS1 mathematics remain available for schools that wish to use them. These frameworks support teachers in making accurate judgements about pupil attainment against national standards.

The KS1 mathematics framework contains 'pupil can' statements organised into three standards:

- **Working towards the expected standard**: Pupils demonstrate some mathematical knowledge but require support to apply it consistently
- **Working at the expected standard**: Pupils meet all the criteria for expected performance
- **Working at greater depth**: Pupils demonstrate sophisticated understanding and can apply knowledge in unfamiliar contexts

To judge that a pupil is working at a standard, teachers must have evidence demonstrating that the pupil meets **all** statements within that standard. Evidence may include work in exercise books, observational notes, assessment records, and responses to classroom questioning.

### The 'Pupil Can' Statements

The KS1 mathematics framework addresses four key areas:

**Number and Place Value**: Pupils work with numbers up to 100, understanding place value in two-digit numbers, counting in steps of 2, 3, 5, and 10, and comparing and ordering numbers.

**Addition and Subtraction**: Pupils recall addition and subtraction facts to 20 fluently, derive related facts to 100, and use formal written methods for two-digit numbers.

**Multiplication and Division**: Pupils recall multiplication and division facts for the 2, 5, and 10 tables, recognise odd and even numbers, and solve problems involving grouping and sharing.

**Fractions**: Pupils recognise, find, name, and write fractions including 1/3, 1/4, 2/4, and 3/4 of lengths, shapes, sets of objects, or quantities.

### Pre-Key Stage Standards

For pupils working below the standard of national curriculum assessments, the pre-key stage standards apply. These describe attainment in broad steps from 'entering the expected standard' (PKF) through to 'foundations for the expected standard' (PK6). Teachers use these standards for pupils engaged in subject-specific study who have not completed the relevant programmes of study.

## Key Stage 2 Assessment Framework

### Statutory Mathematics Tests

KS2 mathematics tests remain statutory and are administered to all eligible pupils in May of Year 6. The tests consist of:

**Paper 1: Arithmetic** (30 minutes)
- 36 questions testing written and mental calculation skills
- Content covers all four operations with whole numbers, fractions, and decimals
- No calculators permitted

**Paper 2: Reasoning** (40 minutes)
- Mathematical reasoning and problem-solving questions
- Covers number, measurement, geometry, and statistics
- Some questions allow calculator use (though most pupils do not use them)

**Paper 3: Reasoning** (40 minutes)
- Further reasoning questions with increased complexity
- Greater emphasis on multi-step problems and mathematical reasoning

Test papers are marked externally by the DfE/STA. Results are returned to schools in July, scaled scores are calculated, and national performance data is published.

### Scaled Scores and Performance Descriptors

The scaled score system converts raw test marks to a standardised scale where 100 represents the expected standard. The scale typically ranges from 80 to 120:

- **100 or above**: Working at the expected standard
- **110 or above**: High level of attainment (often interpreted as working at greater depth)
- **Below 100**: Working towards the expected standard

Schools receive detailed question-level analysis through the 'Test outcomes' section of the Analyse School Performance (ASP) service. This enables teachers to identify specific curriculum areas where pupils performed well or require further support.

### Teacher Assessment at KS2

Teacher assessment at KS2 is statutory for English writing and science only. Mathematics is assessed through the statutory tests, and no separate teacher assessment is required. However, many schools choose to record teacher assessments to provide a more holistic picture of pupil attainment, particularly for pupils who may not perform well in test conditions.

For pupils working below the standard of the tests, teachers use the pre-key stage standards (PK1-PK6) to describe attainment in English reading, English writing, and mathematics.

## Formative Assessment in Primary Mathematics

### The Role of Formative Assessment

Ofsted's 2023 subject report 'Coordinating Mathematical Success' emphasises that high-quality assessment is essential for ensuring all pupils progress through the curriculum at an appropriate pace. The report highlights that effective formative assessment enables teachers to identify gaps and misconceptions promptly and adjust teaching accordingly.

Formative assessment, often described as 'assessment for learning', involves ongoing evaluation of pupil understanding throughout lessons and units of work. Unlike summative assessment, which evaluates learning at the end of a period, formative assessment informs teaching decisions in real-time.

Hodgen and Wiliam, in their influential publication 'Mathematics Inside the Black Box' (2006), identify five key strategies for effective formative assessment:

1. **Clarifying and sharing learning intentions and criteria for success**
2. **Engineering effective classroom discussions and activities that elicit evidence of learning**
3. **Providing feedback that moves learners forward**
4. **Activating students as instructional resources for one another**
5. **Activating students as owners of their own learning**

### Diagnostic Questions and Misconceptions

Diagnostic questions are a powerful formative assessment tool specifically designed to reveal mathematical misconceptions. Craig Barton's Diagnostic Questions platform, now integrated with White Rose Maths, provides thousands of multiple-choice questions where each incorrect answer reveals a specific misconception.

For example, a diagnostic question might ask: "What is ½ + ¼?"
- A) 2/6 (adds numerators and denominators - common misconception)
- B) ¾ (correct answer)
- C) 2/4 (adds numerators only)
- D) 3/4 (misreads question)

Each incorrect answer pattern provides the teacher with specific information about a pupil's understanding, enabling targeted intervention.

White Rose Maths provides diagnostic quizzes for each small step in their scheme of work. Each small step has Quiz A (baseline), Quiz B (follow-up), and Quiz C (further assessment if needed). These quizzes contain 5 questions each and are designed to be quick to administer while providing rich diagnostic information.

### Assessment for Mastery

The mastery approach to mathematics teaching, which has gained widespread adoption in English primary schools, has specific implications for assessment. In a mastery classroom:

**Whole-class teaching** means most pupils move through content at the same pace. Assessment identifies pupils who need additional support or extension rather than grouping pupils by prior attainment.

**Same-day intervention** requires teachers to identify pupils who have not grasped the day's learning and provide immediate support, often during the lesson or immediately afterwards.

**Intelligent practice** involves exercises that develop fluency while revealing understanding. Teachers assess through careful observation of pupils working on practice activities.

**Variation theory** uses carefully sequenced examples to draw attention to mathematical structure. Assessment involves checking whether pupils can identify the underlying pattern or relationship.

### Live Marking and Dynamic Response

Ofsted's 2023 report notes that effective mathematics teaching involves 'dynamic response' to pupil understanding during lessons. This requires teachers to circulate during independent work, checking understanding and addressing misconceptions immediately—a practice sometimes called 'live marking'.

Key features of effective live marking include:

- **Focused observation**: Teachers target specific pupils based on prior assessment data or observed difficulty during whole-class teaching
- **Targeted questioning**: Rather than simply checking answers, teachers ask 'why' questions to probe understanding
- **Immediate feedback**: Pupils receive feedback while errors are fresh in their minds
- **Responsive grouping**: Teachers may pull together a small group for immediate re-teaching based on common misconceptions

## Summative Assessment Practices

### Using Summative Tests Formatively

While summative tests primarily evaluate learning at a particular point, Ofsted (2023) notes that they can serve formative purposes when used effectively. Hodgen and Wiliam suggest several strategies:

**Question-level analysis**: Rather than focusing solely on overall scores, teachers analyse performance on specific question types or curriculum areas. This identifies gaps that can be addressed through targeted teaching.

**Pupil self-assessment**: Involving pupils in reviewing their own test performance helps develop metacognitive awareness. Pupils identify questions they found difficult and articulate what they need to learn.

**Error analysis**: Teachers use common errors from tests to plan re-teaching. If multiple pupils make the same error, this indicates a teaching point that needs reinforcement.

### Interim Assessment Materials

Many schools use commercially available or locally developed interim assessments to track progress between statutory assessment points. These might include:

- **Half-termly tests** aligned to curriculum coverage
- **End-of-unit assessments** following specific topics
- **Standardised assessments** such as PUMA (Progress in Understanding Mathematics Assessment) or NFER tests

When using such assessments, schools should ensure they align with curriculum content and do not create unnecessary burden. Ofsted (2023) warns against excessive assessment that detracts from teaching time.

### The Importance of Validity

Validity in assessment means that the assessment measures what it claims to measure. In mathematics, this has several dimensions:

**Content validity**: Does the assessment cover the curriculum content it purports to cover? A test focused solely on calculation would have low content validity for assessing the full primary mathematics curriculum.

**Construct validity**: Does the assessment measure mathematical reasoning and not just procedural fluency? Questions that can be answered through rote procedure without understanding have low construct validity.

**Predictive validity**: Does performance on the assessment predict future mathematical success? This is particularly important for early assessments that aim to identify pupils at risk of falling behind.

## Assessment for Pupils Working Below Age-Related Expectations

### The Engagement Model

For pupils not engaged in subject-specific study, the engagement model replaces P-scales. This applies to pupils with the most severe and profound learning difficulties. The model assesses:

- **Exploration**: How the pupil investigates their environment
- **Realisation**: The pupil's response to stimuli and activities
- **Anticipation**: The pupil's prediction of familiar events
- **Persistence**: The pupil's sustained attention to activities
- **Initiation**: The pupil's independent action and choice-making

### Pre-Key Stage Standards

For pupils engaged in subject-specific study but working below the standard of national curriculum tests, the pre-key stage standards provide a framework for describing attainment. In mathematics, the standards describe progression from early awareness of number through to foundations for the expected standard.

The six pre-key stage standards (PK1-PK6) describe increasing sophistication in:
- Number and counting
- Calculation
- Shape and measure
- Mathematical communication

Teachers use these standards to track progress for pupils with significant learning difficulties and to identify appropriate next steps.

### Assessment for SEND Pupils

Effective assessment for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) requires:

**Small-step targets**: Breaking learning into very small, achievable steps with clear success criteria
**Multiple forms of evidence**: Recognising that written work may not capture the full extent of understanding
**Alternative response modes**: Allowing pupils to demonstrate understanding through speaking, drawing, or practical activity
**Regular review**: Frequent assessment to inform responsive teaching

Access arrangements for statutory tests include additional time, rest breaks, scribes, readers, and modified test papers. Schools must apply for access arrangements in advance, following STA guidance.

## Assessment and Curriculum Sequencing

### The Role of Assessment in Curriculum Planning

Ofsted (2023) emphasises that assessment should be designed around the curriculum, not the reverse. This means:

**Curriculum-first approach**: Schools first determine what pupils should learn and then design assessment to check whether they have learned it.

**Retrieval practice**: Regular low-stakes quizzing that requires pupils to retrieve previously learned content, strengthening long-term memory.

**Spaced practice**: Assessment that revisits content from earlier in the year or previous years, recognising that retention requires ongoing reinforcement.

### Checking Prior Knowledge

Effective teaching begins with assessing what pupils already know. Strategies for checking prior knowledge include:

**Entry quizzes**: Short quizzes at the start of a unit to identify what pupils remember from previous teaching
**Mind maps**: Pupils create visual representations of what they already know about a topic
**KWL grids**: Pupils identify what they Know, Want to know, and have Learned
**Discussion**: Whole-class discussion that reveals common misconceptions or gaps

### Identifying and Addressing Gaps

When assessment reveals gaps in understanding, teachers must decide how to respond. Options include:

**Whole-class re-teaching**: If a significant proportion of the class has not understood, re-teaching to all pupils may be appropriate
**Same-day intervention**: Immediate support for pupils who need additional explanation or practice
**Pre-teaching**: Providing advance support for pupils likely to struggle with upcoming content
**Gap filling**: Specific sessions focused on prerequisite knowledge before new content is introduced

## Professional Development for Assessment

### Developing Teacher Assessment Literacy

Effective assessment requires professional knowledge and skill. Key areas for teacher development include:

**Understanding validity and reliability**: Teachers need to understand what makes an assessment trustworthy and how to interpret results appropriately.

**Assessment design**: Creating questions and tasks that reveal understanding rather than just correct answers.

**Data literacy**: Interpreting assessment data to identify patterns and inform decisions.

**Feedback effectiveness**: Understanding what makes feedback effective and how to provide it efficiently.

### Moderation and Standardisation

Moderation—teachers discussing pupil work to reach agreement on standards—is essential for ensuring consistency of assessment. Effective moderation involves:

**Standardisation activities**: Teachers review anonymised work samples and compare their judgements
**Professional dialogue**: Discussion about why particular work meets particular standards
**External moderation**: Where local authorities or academy trusts provide external quality assurance

Schools should build regular moderation into their assessment calendar, particularly around statutory assessment points.

### Using Assessment Data at School Level

Senior leaders use assessment data to:

**Monitor curriculum implementation**: Checking that intended curriculum is being taught and learned
**Identify trends**: Recognising patterns in attainment across year groups or pupil groups
**Evaluate interventions**: Assessing whether additional support programmes are effective
**Report to governors**: Providing governing bodies with information about school performance

However, Ofsted warns against data becoming an end in itself. Data should inform professional dialogue about teaching and learning, not drive decisions through numerical targets alone.

## Common Assessment Challenges

### Avoiding Assessment Burden

One of the primary challenges in primary assessment is avoiding excessive burden on teachers and pupils. The removal of statutory KS1 tests was partly motivated by this concern. Schools should:

- Minimise the number of formal assessment points
- Use efficient assessment methods (diagnostic questions, live marking)
- Avoid 'mock' tests that replicate statutory tests
- Ensure assessment generates useful information

### Ensuring Assessment Quality

Poor quality assessment can mislead teachers and result in inappropriate teaching decisions. Common quality issues include:

**Over-reliance on tests**: Tests sample the curriculum; they do not cover it comprehensively. Other forms of evidence are essential.

**Narrowing the curriculum**: When stakes are high, teaching can focus only on tested content, neglecting important areas like mathematical reasoning.

**Inconsistent application**: Without moderation, different teachers may apply standards inconsistently, leading to unreliable data.

### Balancing Accountability and Improvement

Assessment serves both accountability and improvement purposes. Tension between these can create challenges:

**Accountability pressures**: Schools may feel pressure to demonstrate high attainment, potentially leading to inappropriate test preparation or over-assessment.

**Improvement focus**: Assessment should primarily serve learning, helping teachers understand what pupils know and can do.

Ofsted (2023) emphasises that assessment should be 'light touch' where possible, focusing on providing useful information rather than generating data for external scrutiny.
