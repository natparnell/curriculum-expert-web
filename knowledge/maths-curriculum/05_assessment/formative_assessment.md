# Formative Assessment in Mathematics

Formative assessment—often termed "assessment for learning"—is the process of using evidence of student learning to adapt teaching and learning to meet student needs. In mathematics education, it represents one of the most powerful levers available to teachers for improving pupil outcomes. This knowledge base article synthesises research from the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics (NCETM), and seminal work by Paul Black and Dylan Wiliam to provide a comprehensive guide to implementing formative assessment in the mathematics classroom.

## Defining Formative Assessment

### The Distinction from Summative Assessment

Formative assessment differs fundamentally from summative assessment. Summative assessment evaluates learning at the end of an instructional period—such as end-of-unit tests, SATs, or GCSE examinations. It provides a judgment about what has been learned. Formative assessment, by contrast, is integrated into the teaching process itself, providing ongoing feedback that enables teachers to adjust their instruction and pupils to adjust their learning strategies.

Black and Wiliam (1998), in their groundbreaking review of over 600 studies, defined assessment broadly as "activities undertaken by teachers—and by their students in assessing themselves—that provide information to be used as feedback to modify teaching and learning activities." This definition places the emphasis squarely on the *use* of assessment information rather than its collection.

### The Five Key Strategies

Dylan Wiliam, working with Marnie Thompson, identified five core strategies that constitute effective formative assessment. These strategies, refined through decades of research and classroom implementation, provide a practical framework for mathematics teachers:

**1. Clarifying, Sharing, and Understanding Learning Intentions and Success Criteria**

Mathematical learning must be made visible to pupils. Teachers need to articulate not just *what* pupils will learn but *what quality work looks like*. In mathematics, this often involves sharing worked examples, modelling mathematical reasoning, and creating success criteria that distinguish procedural fluency from conceptual understanding.

**2. Engineering Effective Classroom Discussions and Tasks**

Quality of classroom talk matters enormously in mathematics. Teachers must design questions and tasks that elicit evidence of thinking—not just correct answers. This involves moving beyond simple factual recall questions to those that reveal pupils' reasoning, misconceptions, and problem-solving approaches.

**3. Providing Feedback that Moves Learning Forward**

Feedback in mathematics must be specific, actionable, and forward-looking. Research consistently shows that comments alone produce greater learning gains than grades alone or grades combined with comments. Effective mathematical feedback focuses on the mathematical thinking process rather than simply marking answers right or wrong.

**4. Activating Students as Learning Resources for One Another**

Peer assessment and collaborative learning in mathematics enable pupils to articulate their reasoning, encounter alternative approaches, and develop mathematical communication skills. When pupils explain their thinking to peers, they consolidate their own understanding while helping others identify gaps in their knowledge.

**5. Activating Students as Owners of Their Own Learning**

Self-assessment in mathematics develops metacognitive awareness. Pupils who can evaluate their own work against clear criteria become more autonomous learners, better able to identify when they need additional support or when they are ready to move to more challenging material.

## The Research Base: Why Formative Assessment Matters

### The Black and Wiliam Meta-Analysis

In 1998, Paul Black and Dylan Wiliam published "Inside the Black Box: Raising Standards Through Classroom Assessment," a review of research that would fundamentally reshape understanding of assessment in education. Their analysis of 580 studies found that formative assessment practices produced significant learning gains, with effect sizes typically between 0.4 and 0.7—equivalent to moving a pupil from the 50th to the 75th percentile in achievement.

Critically, Black and Wiliam found that these gains were particularly pronounced for lower-attaining pupils. Formative assessment practices reduced the spread of attainment while raising achievement overall. This finding has profound implications for equity in mathematics education, where gaps in attainment often widen over time if left unaddressed.

### The EEF Embedding Formative Assessment Programme

The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) has invested significantly in researching and promoting formative assessment. Their Embedding Formative Assessment programme, delivered by the Schools, Students and Teachers network (SSAT), provided structured support for schools to implement the five key strategies.

Trials involving 140 schools found that pupils in schools using the programme made approximately two months' additional progress compared to control groups. Notably, 106 of the 140 participating schools were rated Good or Outstanding by Ofsted, demonstrating that even high-performing schools can realise significant gains through focused formative assessment practice.

The EEF emphasises that formative assessment is particularly effective in mathematics because the subject has clear right and wrong answers, enabling rapid feedback, but also because mathematical misconceptions, once embedded, are difficult to remediate. Early identification through formative assessment is therefore crucial.

## Formative Assessment in the Mathematics Classroom

### Mathematics Inside the Black Box

Jeremy Hodgen and Dylan Wiliam developed the "Mathematics Inside the Black Box" guidance specifically for mathematics teachers. This booklet addresses the unique challenges of formative assessment in a subject where procedural fluency and conceptual understanding must develop together.

The guidance identifies several mathematics-specific considerations:

**Understanding Learning Intentions in Mathematics**

Mathematical learning intentions must make clear whether the focus is on conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, or problem-solving application. A learning intention such as "To multiply two-digit numbers" is insufficient—it could mean understanding the distributive property, executing the standard algorithm, or applying multiplication to solve word problems. Success criteria must distinguish these levels of understanding.

**The Role of Mathematical Dialogue**

Classroom discussion in mathematics serves multiple formative purposes. When pupils explain their reasoning, teachers gain insight into whether they have memorised procedures without understanding or have developed genuine conceptual grasp. Discussion also makes mathematical thinking visible to other pupils, modelling how mathematicians reason through problems.

**Written Work and Misconceptions**

Mathematics generates substantial written work, but not all written work provides useful formative information. Hodgen and Wiliam argue that teachers need to distinguish between "practice" work, designed to build fluency, and "assessment" work, designed to reveal understanding. Over-reliance on repetitive practice exercises can obscure emerging misconceptions.

### The NCETM Teaching for Mastery Assessment Materials

The National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics (NCETM) has produced comprehensive assessment materials supporting teaching for mastery. These materials, developed by experts including Mike Askew, Sarah Bishop, and Debbie Morgan, provide questions, tasks, and activities designed to support assessment across Years 1-6.

The NCETM materials are structured around key mathematical skills and concepts within each year programme. Rather than providing simple right/wrong questions, they offer examples that reveal the depth of pupils' understanding. For example, rather than simply asking pupils to calculate 23 × 4, an assessment task might ask them to explain why 23 × 4 is the same as 20 × 4 plus 3 × 4, revealing whether they understand the distributive property.

The mastery approach to assessment emphasises that all pupils should achieve deep understanding of the mathematical content for their year group. Formative assessment identifies pupils who need additional support or alternative representations to achieve this depth, while also identifying those ready for greater challenge through exposure to complex problems requiring application of the same concepts.

### Diagnostic Questioning

Craig Barton, a mathematics teacher and author, has championed diagnostic questioning as a cornerstone of formative assessment. His work, including the creation of DiagnosticQuestions.com, the world's largest collection of free diagnostic mathematics questions, demonstrates how carefully designed multiple-choice questions can transform assessment efficiency.

**The Design of Diagnostic Questions**

A well-designed diagnostic question has three key characteristics:

1. It is multiple-choice with four plausible answers
2. Each wrong answer is based on a specific, identifiable misconception
3. A pupil answering incorrectly reveals precisely what they misunderstand

For example, consider the question: "What is 0.3 × 0.4?" with answers (a) 0.12, (b) 1.2, (c) 0.012, (d) 12. A pupil choosing (b) may believe that multiplication always makes numbers bigger. A pupil choosing (c) may be counting decimal places incorrectly. The wrong answer reveals the specific misconception requiring intervention.

**Implementing Diagnostic Questions**

Barton argues that diagnostic questions should be used at multiple points in the instructional cycle:

- **Before teaching**: To identify existing misconceptions and adjust teaching accordingly
- **During teaching**: To check understanding in real-time and decide whether to reteach or proceed
- **After teaching**: To assess retention and identify pupils needing additional support
- **For homework**: To provide individualised feedback based on specific wrong answers

The EEF has endorsed diagnostic questioning as one of five key ways to use assessment in the mathematics classroom, noting that "multiple-choice questions which provide an immediate check of initial understanding and, when well designed, have wrong answers based upon common misconceptions" are particularly effective.

## Practical Classroom Strategies

### The Mini-Whiteboard

Mini-whiteboards (or show-me boards) are among the most powerful yet simple formative assessment tools in mathematics. Every pupil writes their answer and holds it up simultaneously, giving the teacher immediate visual information about the class's understanding.

Effective mini-whiteboard use involves:
- Asking questions that reveal thinking, not just final answers
- Insisting on simultaneous display to prevent copying
- Using the information to make immediate teaching decisions
- Following up wrong answers with targeted questions rather than simply correcting

### The Hinge Question

A hinge question is a carefully designed question asked at a critical "hinge point" in a lesson—typically when the teacher must decide whether to move on or reteach. A good hinge question:
- Can be answered quickly (within 2 minutes)
- Is answered by every pupil simultaneously
- Provides unambiguous evidence of understanding
- Has wrong answers based on common misconceptions

For example, after teaching equivalent fractions, a hinge question might be: "Which fraction is equivalent to 3/4?" with answers designed to catch pupils who add to numerator and denominator, multiply incorrectly, or confuse equivalence with other operations.

### Live Marking and Feedback

Rather than collecting books to mark at the end of the day, many mathematics teachers use live marking—circulating during independent practice to provide immediate, individual feedback. This approach:
- Addresses misconceptions before they become embedded
- Provides immediate guidance while the problem is fresh in the pupil's mind
- Allows the teacher to identify common errors for whole-class reteaching
- Reduces the marking burden outside class time

Effective live marking requires clear routines so pupils know what to do when stuck and how to act on feedback received.

### Exit Tickets

An exit ticket is a brief formative assessment completed in the final minutes of a lesson. Typically consisting of one or two questions, exit tickets provide evidence of whether pupils have grasped the lesson's core concept. Teachers review exit tickets before the next lesson to identify who needs additional support, who is ready to move on, and whether any whole-class reteaching is required.

## Formative Assessment Across Key Stages

### Early Years and Key Stage 1

In the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) and Key Stage 1, formative assessment in mathematics is largely observation-based. Teachers assess through:
- Conversations about mathematical thinking
- Observations of pupils using manipulatives and representations
- Assessment of whether pupils can apply learning to new contexts
- Check for understanding of mathematical language

The NCETM Mastering Number programme provides specific guidance for formative assessment in early number, emphasising the importance of assessing fluency with number facts, flexibility with calculation, and confidence in mathematical reasoning.

### Key Stage 2

As mathematics becomes more abstract in Key Stage 2, formative assessment must check both procedural fluency and conceptual understanding. The NCETM assessment materials for Years 3-6 are organised around key mathematical concepts and provide questions that reveal depth of understanding.

Key formative assessment foci in Key Stage 2 include:
- Understanding of place value and the structure of the number system
- Flexibility with calculation methods (mental, informal, formal)
- Understanding of fractions, decimals, and percentages as related concepts
- Ability to solve multi-step problems
- Use of mathematical vocabulary to explain reasoning

### Key Stage 3 and 4

In secondary mathematics, formative assessment becomes crucial for identifying and addressing the gaps that often emerge as the curriculum becomes more demanding. The White Rose Maths secondary schemes include regular assessment checkpoints, while GCSE preparation requires ongoing formative assessment of both content knowledge and problem-solving strategies.

Diagnostic questioning becomes particularly valuable at this stage, as misconceptions from earlier key stages often persist and compound. Formative assessment should check:
- Foundational knowledge from Key Stage 2 (particularly fractions, decimals, percentages, and ratio)
- Algebraic thinking and manipulation
- Understanding of geometric properties and relationships
- Ability to select appropriate methods for unstructured problems

## Assessment Without Levels

The Commission on Assessment Without Levels, established by the Department for Education (DfE) following the removal of National Curriculum levels in 2014, emphasised the importance of formative assessment. Their final report stated that "in-class formative assessment is a vital part of teaching and learning and can provide teachers with some of the most powerful information they can have about their pupils."

The Commission noted that the old levelling system had distorted assessment practices, with teachers feeling pressured to "level" every piece of work rather than using assessment to inform teaching. In the post-levels environment, schools have developed alternative approaches, many centred on:

- **Mastery statements**: Descriptors of what pupils should know and be able to do
- **Depth of understanding**: Assessing whether pupils have "surface" or "deep" understanding
- **Application**: Checking whether pupils can apply learning to new problems
- **Progression**: Tracking progress through curriculum content rather than level numbers

The Commission emphasised that no single national system was required—schools should develop approaches that suit their contexts, provided they enable effective formative assessment.

## Common Challenges and Misconceptions

### Confusing Assessment with Grading

One persistent challenge is confusing formative assessment with the assignment of grades or levels. True formative assessment provides information that moves learning forward. Grading, particularly when it involves comparing pupils to each other, can undermine the learning-focused culture that formative assessment requires.

Research by Ruth Butler (1988) found that pupils who received comments alone made significantly more progress than those who received grades alone or grades with comments. When pupils receive grades, they tend to compare themselves to others rather than focusing on how to improve.

### Insufficient Response to Assessment Information

Collecting assessment information is pointless if it does not influence teaching. A common failing is to identify that pupils do not understand something but proceed with the lesson plan regardless. Formative assessment requires the flexibility to reteach, the provision of alternative explanations, and the willingness to adjust pacing based on evidence.

### Over-reliance on Written Tests

While written tests have their place, they cannot capture all aspects of mathematical understanding. Formative assessment must include opportunities for pupils to explain their thinking, demonstrate understanding through multiple representations, and apply knowledge to novel problems.

### The Burden of Marking

Traditional marking practices—teachers writing extensive comments in books after school—are neither sustainable nor particularly effective. The workload associated with marking has led many teachers to abandon formative assessment altogether. Alternative approaches, including live marking, whole-class feedback, and peer/self-assessment, can provide the benefits of formative feedback without the unsustainable workload.

## Implementing Formative Assessment: A Whole-School Approach

### Leadership and Culture

Effective formative assessment requires whole-school commitment. School leaders must:
- Prioritise assessment for learning over assessment of learning
- Protect time for professional development on formative assessment strategies
- Review marking and feedback policies to ensure they support rather than hinder formative practice
- Create a culture where pupils see mistakes as learning opportunities

### Professional Development

Implementing formative assessment effectively requires ongoing professional development. The EEF's Embedding Formative Assessment programme provides structured support over two years, including:
- Teacher learning communities meeting monthly to share practice
- Focus on one strategy at a time to build expertise gradually
- Peer observation and collaborative planning
- Leadership support to sustain implementation

### Departmental Development

Within mathematics departments, formative assessment can be developed through:
- Collaborative design of hinge questions and diagnostic assessments
- Shared observation of pupil responses to identify common misconceptions
- Development of departmental banks of diagnostic questions
- Regular review of assessment data to identify topics requiring reteaching

## Conclusion

Formative assessment represents one of the most evidence-based and cost-effective approaches to improving mathematics teaching. The research of Black and Wiliam, the practical frameworks developed by Dylan Wiliam and Craig Barton, and the resources provided by NCETM and the EEF give mathematics teachers a wealth of tools for implementing formative assessment effectively.

The key principles are clear: make learning intentions explicit, engineer tasks that reveal thinking, provide feedback that moves learning forward, activate pupils as learning resources for each other, and develop pupils as owners of their own learning. When these principles are embedded in daily practice, mathematics teachers can respond to pupil needs in real-time, address misconceptions before they become embedded, and ensure that all pupils make progress.

In the context of teaching for mastery, formative assessment is essential. Mastery requires that all pupils develop deep understanding of the mathematics they are learning—and formative assessment provides the information teachers need to ensure this happens. As the mathematics education community continues to develop its understanding of effective formative assessment, the core insight remains: assessment is only formative if it informs teaching and learning.
