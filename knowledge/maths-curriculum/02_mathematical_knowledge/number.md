# Number: Foundations of Primary Mathematics

## Introduction: The Centrality of Number

Number is the cornerstone of primary mathematics education. The National Curriculum for Mathematics in England identifies number as the first and most substantial programme of study, with the explicit expectation that by the end of Key Stage 1, pupils should have developed "confidence and mental fluency with whole numbers, counting and place value" (DfE, 2013). This foundational understanding of number underpins all subsequent mathematical learning, from calculation strategies to algebraic reasoning.

The Department for Education's Mathematics Guidance for Key Stages 1 and 2 (2020) identifies number and place value as one of six core strands of the "ready-to-progress" criteria – the essential concepts and skills that pupils must master to access the next phase of learning. The National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics (NCETM) has subsequently developed extensive professional development materials and the Mastering Number programme to support teachers in securing these foundations.

This knowledge base entry examines the multifaceted nature of number in primary mathematics, exploring the interconnected concepts of cardinality, ordinality, and composition; the progression of place value understanding; evidence-based pedagogical approaches including the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) framework; and common misconceptions that impede pupils' mathematical development. The focus is on practical classroom application grounded in current research and official guidance.

## Understanding Number: Core Concepts

### Cardinality: The "How Many-ness" of Number

Cardinality refers to the understanding that the final number word used when counting a set of objects represents the total quantity of that set. This seemingly simple concept – that when we count "one, two, three, four, five" the "five" tells us how many items there are in total – represents a significant cognitive milestone for young children.

The NCETM's Mastering Number programme, now implemented in over 8,000 primary schools, identifies cardinality as one of the five key early number concepts that require systematic development (NCETM, 2023). Research by Gelman and Gallistel (1978) established that children must master five counting principles before they can count effectively:

1. **The one-to-one principle**: Each object receives exactly one count word
2. **The stable order principle**: Count words must be used in their correct sequence
3. **The cardinal principle**: The final count word represents the set's quantity
4. **The abstraction principle**: Any collection of objects can be counted
5. **The order-irrelevance principle**: Objects can be counted in any order

The cardinal principle is particularly significant because it marks the transition from counting as a procedural activity to understanding number as a representation of quantity. Children who have not fully grasped cardinality may be able to count objects accurately but fail to understand that the final number word tells them "how many" there are. When asked "how many?" after counting, they may start counting again rather than stating the cardinal value.

Teaching strategies to develop cardinality include:

- **Emphasising the cardinal value**: After counting, explicitly stating "so there are five altogether" and gesturing to indicate the entire set
- **Matching and comparing**: Encouraging children to match objects one-to-one to establish quantity relationships
- **Subitising activities**: Recognising small quantities without counting, which supports the development of mental representations of number
- **Cardinality games**: Activities where children must state the total quantity after counting, such as "how many in the jar?"

### Ordinality: Numbers in Sequence

While cardinality concerns the quantity that a number represents, ordinality concerns the position of a number within the number system. The NCETM emphasises that ordinality is "where numbers come in the number system and their relationship to each other" (NCETM, 2023). Understanding ordinality enables pupils to compare numbers, identify which is larger or smaller, and reason about the relative magnitude of quantities.

Ordinality is typically represented through number lines, which the NCETM and Maths Hubs use extensively in the Mastering Number programme. Children explore various types of number lines:

- **Marked number lines**: Lines with numbers indicated at regular intervals
- **Partially marked number lines**: Lines with some numbers shown and others to be inferred
- **Empty number lines**: Lines without markings, requiring pupils to position numbers based on their understanding of relative magnitude

The progression from marked to empty number lines reflects the development of ordinal understanding. Initially, pupils need the support of marked lines to position numbers accurately. As their understanding develops, they can work with increasingly sparse representations, eventually able to position numbers on empty lines by reasoning about their relationship to known anchor points (such as multiples of 5 or 10).

Teaching ordinality effectively requires explicit attention to:

- **The counting sequence**: Ensuring pupils can count forwards and backwards from any starting point, not just from one
- **Comparing quantities**: Using language of "more than," "less than," "fewer," and "the same as"
- **Number line estimation**: Activities where pupils estimate where numbers should be placed on lines
- **Magnitude comparison**: Reasoning about which of two numbers is larger and explaining why

### The Cardinal-Ordinal Connection

A crucial insight for teachers is the relationship between cardinality and ordinality. While distinct concepts, they are deeply interconnected. The number "five" simultaneously represents:

- A quantity of five objects (cardinality)
- The fifth position in a sequence (ordinality)
- A point on the number line between four and six (ordinality)

Pupils need to develop flexibility in moving between these interpretations. A child who understands cardinality but not ordinality may struggle with number lines and comparison tasks. Conversely, a child with good ordinal understanding but weak cardinality may be able to recite the counting sequence without understanding what the numbers actually represent.

The NCETM's professional development materials emphasise that both aspects must be developed together through carefully designed activities that require pupils to use numbers in different ways. For example, a lesson might begin with counting objects to establish cardinality ("there are seven cubes"), move to placing those cubes on a number line to develop ordinality ("seven comes after six"), and conclude with comparison ("seven is more than five").

## Number Composition and the Part-Whole Relationship

### Understanding Composition

Number composition refers to the understanding that numbers are made up of other numbers – that a whole can be partitioned into parts in various ways. This concept is fundamental to developing fluency with calculation. As the DfE Mathematics Guidance (2020) notes, understanding "how numbers are made up of other numbers" is a core ready-to-progress criterion (NPV-2).

The part-whole model (also known as the cherry diagram or part-part-whole diagram) is the primary representation used to teach composition. This model shows a whole divided into parts, visually representing that the parts combine to make the whole. For example, the number 7 might be shown partitioned into 3 and 4, or 2 and 5, or 1 and 6.

The NCETM's Primary Mastery Professional Development materials identify several key teaching points for introducing part-whole relationships:

1. A whole group of objects can be composed of two or more parts
2. The group can be split in many different ways
3. The parts might look different (e.g., different colours, sizes, or arrangements)
4. Each part will be smaller than the whole group
5. The parts can be combined to make the whole group

### Number Bonds and Fluency

Number bonds – the pairs of numbers that combine to make a given total – are the practical application of part-whole understanding. The National Curriculum expects that "by the end of year 2, pupils should know the number bonds to 20" (DfE, 2013). This expectation reflects the importance of automatic recall of these facts for efficient calculation.

However, the goal is not merely memorisation but understanding. Pupils should understand that:

- 7 + 8 = 15 because 7 can be partitioned into 5 + 2, and 5 + 2 + 8 = 5 + 10 = 15
- 15 - 7 = 8 because if 15 is composed of 7 and 8, removing 7 leaves 8

The NCETM Mastering Number programme uses stem sentences to support this reasoning:

- "Seven is made of five and two"
- "Five and two make seven"
- "If I know 5 + 2 = 7, then I know 7 - 2 = 5"

These sentences make the part-whole relationship explicit and support pupils in verbalising their mathematical thinking. Research by Cowan et al. (2011) found that explicit teaching of number bonds using part-whole relationships leads to better retention and application than rote memorisation alone.

### Extending to Larger Numbers

Part-whole understanding extends far beyond number bonds to 10 or 20. It underpins:

- **Place value**: Understanding that 46 is composed of 40 and 6
- **Calculation strategies**: Partitioning numbers to make calculations easier (e.g., 38 + 25 = 38 + 2 + 23 = 40 + 23)
- **Fractions**: Understanding that a whole can be partitioned into equal parts
- **Algebra**: The concept of variables representing unknown parts of a whole

The DfE's ready-to-progress criteria emphasise this progression. NPV-1 focuses on understanding 10s, NPV-2 on composition, and NPV-3 on the position of numbers. These criteria build systematically, with each layer of understanding supporting the next.

## Place Value: The Foundation of Our Number System

### The Base-10 Structure

Our Hindu-Arabic number system uses a place value structure based on powers of 10. This elegant system allows us to represent any quantity using just ten symbols (0-9) by varying their position. Understanding this structure is essential for all work with larger numbers and calculation.

The DfE Mathematics Guidance (2020) identifies place value understanding as NPV-1: knowing that 10 ones are equivalent to 1 ten, and that place value applies to all numbers. This apparently simple idea has profound implications:

- The position of a digit determines its value
- Each position is 10 times the value of the position to its right
- Zero acts as a place holder, indicating an empty position

Teaching place value effectively requires careful attention to the transition from unitary counting (treating each digit as representing ones) to multiplicative understanding (recognising that the "3" in 35 represents 30, not 3).

### Common Misconceptions in Place Value

Research has identified several persistent misconceptions that impede pupils' place value understanding:

**1. Face value confusion**
Some pupils interpret digits according to their face value regardless of position. For example, seeing 35 as simply "3 and 5" rather than "30 and 5." This misconception leads to errors such as treating 35 + 28 as 3 + 2 and 5 + 8.

**2. Whole number dominance**
Pupils may overgeneralise whole number patterns to decimals, believing that 0.10 is larger than 0.2 because "10 is more than 2." This reflects a lack of understanding of the decimal place value system.

**3. Right-to-left reading**
When comparing numbers like 37 and 312, pupils may focus on the rightmost digits first (7 vs 2) and conclude that 37 is larger. This indicates a failure to understand that position determines value.

**4. The "symmetry" misconception**
Some pupils believe the place value system is symmetrical around the ones column, expecting there to be a "oneths" position analogous to tens. Understanding that the decimal system continues with tenths, hundredths, etc., requires explicit teaching.

### Teaching Strategies for Place Value

Effective place value teaching uses a combination of concrete materials, pictorial representations, and abstract symbols – the CPA approach.

**Concrete materials**: Base-10 blocks (Dienes apparatus), place value counters, and straws for bundling provide physical experiences of grouping and exchanging. Pupils can see and feel that 10 individual units are equivalent to 1 ten stick.

**Pictorial representations**: Place value grids, part-whole models, and arrow cards help pupils visualise the structure of numbers. The NCETM materials emphasise the use of ten frames and number lines alongside base-10 representations.

**Abstract symbols**: Once pupils have secure concrete and pictorial experiences, they can work with digits and place value charts. The transition to abstract should be gradual, with pupils encouraged to "draw what they see" when working concretely.

Key teaching strategies include:

- **Renaming**: Practising saying numbers in different ways (e.g., 46 is "4 tens and 6 ones" or "46 ones" or "3 tens and 16 ones")
- **Comparing and ordering**: Using place value knowledge to compare numbers and explain reasoning
- **Rounding and approximation**: Understanding the magnitude of numbers by placing them on number lines
- **Multiplication and division by 10**: Understanding the effect on digit positions rather than simply "adding a zero"

## The Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) Approach

### Origins and Principles

The Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract approach, first proposed by Jerome Bruner in 1966, provides a framework for sequencing mathematical experiences to build deep understanding. The approach recognises that mathematical concepts are abstract and that pupils need carefully scaffolded experiences to develop internal representations.

As HFL Education notes, the CPA approach "is a crucial strategy to teach maths for mastery" (HFL Education, 2023). The three stages are:

**Concrete**: Pupils use physical objects to model mathematical concepts. This might involve counting real objects, using base-10 blocks to represent numbers, or manipulating counters to explore number bonds. The concrete stage provides sensory experiences that form the foundation for understanding.

**Pictorial**: Pupils use visual representations to model concepts. These might be drawings of concrete materials (such as drawing base-10 blocks), diagrams like part-whole models, or more abstract representations like number lines. The pictorial stage bridges the gap between physical experience and abstract symbols.

**Abstract**: Pupils use symbolic notation – digits, equations, and mathematical symbols – to represent and work with concepts. The abstract stage builds on the secure understanding developed through concrete and pictorial experiences.

### Implementing CPA for Number

When teaching number concepts, the CPA approach might unfold as follows:

**Teaching number bonds to 10**:
- Concrete: Using two-colour counters or cubes to find pairs that make 10
- Pictorial: Drawing the counters on a ten frame or using part-whole diagrams
- Abstract: Writing equations such as 7 + 3 = 10 and exploring inverse relationships

**Teaching place value (two-digit numbers)**:
- Concrete: Using base-10 blocks to build numbers, exchanging 10 ones for 1 ten
- Pictorial: Drawing the blocks or using place value charts
- Abstract: Reading and writing numbers, partitioning flexibly (e.g., 46 = 40 + 6 = 30 + 16)

**Teaching addition with exchange**:
- Concrete: Using place value counters, physically exchanging 10 ones for 1 ten
- Pictorial: Drawing the calculation in a place value grid
- Abstract: Recording the standard written method with understanding of why exchange occurs

### The Importance of Flexibility

A common misconception about CPA is that it represents a linear progression through which pupils pass once. In reality, the stages are interconnected, and pupils may move between them depending on the complexity of the task. Even confident mathematicians may return to concrete materials when encountering a new or challenging concept.

As Structural Learning notes, it is important to "recognise when students aren't ready for symbols and how cycling between concrete, pictorial and abstract stages ensures genuine mastery" (Structural Learning, 2023). Skipping too quickly to abstract symbols, or removing concrete support before pupils have internalised concepts, can result in superficial understanding and procedural errors.

## The Mastering Number Programme

### Programme Overview

The NCETM's Mastering Number programme, launched in 2021 and now in its fifth year, aims to secure firm foundations in number sense for all children from Reception through to Year 2. The programme provides:

- Detailed session plans for daily number sense sessions
- Professional development for lead teachers
- A set of rekenreks (abacus-like manipulatives) for each participating school
- Access to online community and resources

The EEF-funded trial of the programme found that "schools will receive rekenreks for use during these sessions. In Reception, Mastering Number should be the main maths lesson for number-based work, but in KS1 it should be a short session for the whole class in addition to the main lesson" (EEF, 2023).

### The Rekenrek

The rekenrek is a key tool of the Mastering Number programme. This simple abacus-like device consists of two rows of 10 beads, typically arranged with 5 red and 5 white beads on each row. The rekenrek supports the development of:

- **Subitising**: Recognising quantities without counting
- **Number bonds**: Seeing that 7 can be made as 5 + 2 by sliding beads
- **Doubles**: Recognising that 6 + 6 = 12 by using both rows
- **Strategic calculation**: Moving beads in groups rather than counting individually

The design of the rekenrek – with the colour change at 5 – supports the development of benchmark strategies. Pupils learn to see numbers in relation to 5 and 10, which supports mental calculation. For example, to calculate 8 + 6, pupils might see 8 as "5 and 3" and 6 as "5 and 1," combining the fives to make 10 and adding the remaining 4.

### Programme Impact and Implementation

Research evaluating the programme has shown positive effects on pupil outcomes. Schools report that pupils develop deeper understanding and greater fluency with number facts. Teachers note that pupils who have experienced the programme are better able to explain their mathematical thinking and make connections between concepts.

The programme's success has led to the development of follow-on materials for Key Stage 2, ensuring that the foundations built in the early years continue to be developed as pupils encounter more complex mathematics.
