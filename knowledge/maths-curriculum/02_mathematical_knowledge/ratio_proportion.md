# Ratio and Proportion

Ratio and proportion represent fundamental mathematical concepts that underpin much of the mathematics curriculum from Key Stage 2 through to GCSE and beyond. These concepts connect directly to fractions, decimals, percentages, and multiplicative reasoning, forming a critical bridge between additive and multiplicative thinking. The National Curriculum for mathematics places significant emphasis on ratio and proportion, recognising that these concepts are essential for real-world problem solving and for success in further mathematical study.

The Department for Education (DfE) identifies ratio and proportion as a distinct domain within the Key Stage 3 mathematics programme of study, highlighting that pupils should develop fluency in using ratio notation, connect ratios to fractions and linear functions, and solve problems involving direct and inverse proportion. Understanding how to teach these concepts effectively, with attention to common misconceptions and progression across key stages, is essential for mathematics teachers.

## The Relationship Between Ratio and Proportion

### Defining the Concepts

Whilst ratio and proportion are closely related concepts, they are mathematically distinct. Understanding this distinction is crucial for effective teaching.

**Ratio** compares two or more quantities. It expresses the relative size of one quantity to another. For example, if a recipe requires 2 cups of flour for every 3 cups of sugar, the ratio of flour to sugar is 2:3. Ratios can compare part to part (flour to sugar) or part to whole (flour to total mixture).

**Proportion** refers to the equality of two ratios. When two ratios are equivalent, they are in proportion. For example, the ratios 2:3 and 4:6 are in proportion because they represent the same relationship. Proportion also refers to the relationship between quantities where one quantity is a constant multiple of another.

The National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics (NCETM) emphasises that pupils should be taught "throughout that percentages, decimals and fractions are different ways of expressing proportions." This explicit connection helps pupils develop a unified understanding of multiplicative relationships.

### Multiplicative Reasoning

At the heart of ratio and proportion lies multiplicative reasoning—the understanding that relationships between quantities can be expressed through multiplication and division rather than addition and subtraction. This represents a significant cognitive shift for many pupils.

The KS2-3 Multiplicative Reasoning Project, developed by Maths Hubs in collaboration with the NCETM, recognises that the transition from additive to multiplicative reasoning is a critical point in mathematical development. Teachers need explicit strategies to support this transition, as pupils who rely on additive strategies for proportional problems will struggle as the mathematics becomes more complex.

For example, consider a problem: "If 3 chocolates cost £1.50, how much do 6 chocolates cost?"

An additive approach might involve finding the difference: "6 is 3 more than 3, so add £1.50 to get £3.00." This happens to give the correct answer in this specific case but fails for non-integer multiples.

A multiplicative approach recognises that 6 is double 3, so the cost must double: "6 ÷ 3 = 2, so £1.50 × 2 = £3.00."

Teaching pupils to recognise and apply multiplicative relationships is foundational to success with ratio and proportion.

## National Curriculum Requirements

### Key Stage 2

Ratio and proportion are formally introduced in Year 6 of the National Curriculum, though the foundations are laid through earlier work on fractions and multiplication. The statutory requirements state that pupils should be taught to:

- Solve problems involving the relative sizes of two quantities where missing values can be found by using integer multiplication and division facts
- Solve problems involving the calculation of percentages and the use of percentages for comparison
- Solve problems involving similar shapes where the scale factor is known or can be found
- Solve problems involving unequal sharing and grouping using knowledge of fractions and multiples

The DfE (2021) guidance notes that "pupils solve problems involving unequal quantities, for example, 'for every egg you need 3 spoonfuls of flour', '3/5 of the class are boys'. These problems are the foundation for later formal approaches to ratio and proportion."

### Key Stage 3

The Key Stage 3 programme of study places ratio and proportion within the "Ratio, proportion and rates of change" strand. Pupils should be taught to:

- Change freely between related standard units and compound units
- Use scale factors, scale diagrams and maps
- Express one quantity as a fraction of another
- Use ratio notation, including reduction to simplest form
- Divide a given quantity into two parts in a given part:part or part:whole ratio
- Understand that a multiplicative relationship between two quantities can be expressed as a ratio or a fraction
- Relate the language of ratios and associated calculations to the arithmetic of fractions and linear functions
- Solve problems involving percentage change, including percentage increase, decrease and original value problems
- Solve problems involving direct and inverse proportion, including graphical and algebraic representations

The NCETM highlights that pupils should understand that "a multiplicative relationship between two quantities can be expressed as a ratio or a fraction." This explicit connection helps pupils see ratio and proportion as part of a coherent mathematical framework rather than isolated procedures.

## Pedagogical Approaches

### The Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) Approach

The Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract approach, derived from Jerome Bruner's work and popularised through Singapore mathematics teaching, provides a structured framework for developing understanding of ratio and proportion.

**Concrete Stage:** Pupils work with physical objects to explore ratios. For example, using cubes or counters to represent different quantities: "For every 2 red cubes, we have 3 blue cubes." Pupils can physically combine and compare these quantities, developing an intuitive sense of the relationship.

**Pictorial Stage:** Pupils represent the concrete experiences through drawings, diagrams, or bar models. The bar model is particularly powerful for ratio and proportion problems, providing a visual representation of the multiplicative relationship. For the ratio 2:3, pupils might draw two equal-sized bars, one divided into 2 parts and the other into 3 parts.

**Abstract Stage:** Pupils work with symbolic notation—ratios expressed as 2:3, fractions as 2/5, and algebraic representations such as y = kx for direct proportion. The abstract stage builds on the understanding developed through concrete and pictorial experiences.

HFL Education (2022) notes that the pictorial stage "acts as a 'bridge' to support pupils to make links between the concrete and the abstract and develops their ability to communicate and to represent their mathematics."

### Bar Modelling

Bar modelling deserves particular attention as a strategy for ratio and proportion problems. This visual approach, central to Singapore mathematics pedagogy, helps pupils represent relationships and identify the multiplicative structures within problems.

For a problem such as: "The ratio of red to blue beads is 3:5. There are 24 more blue beads than red beads. How many beads are there altogether?"

A bar model would show:
- Red: ||| (3 units)
- Blue: ||||| (5 units)
- The difference (5 - 3 = 2 units) represents 24 beads
- Therefore 1 unit = 12 beads
- Total beads (8 units) = 96 beads

Bar modelling helps pupils see the structure of the problem and identify what is known and what needs to be found. It supports the transition from additive to multiplicative reasoning by making the units explicit.

### Ratio Tables

Ratio tables provide a powerful representational tool for solving proportion problems. They help pupils organise information, identify patterns, and apply multiplicative reasoning.

For example, when scaling a recipe:

| Flour (g) | Sugar (g) |
|-----------|-----------|
| 200       | 150       |
| 400       | 300       |
| 600       | 450       |
| 100       | 75        |

Pupils can see that multiplying both quantities by the same factor preserves the ratio. Ratio tables also support finding unit ratios—scaling down to find the amount per unit—and provide a foundation for understanding the constant of proportionality.

### Double Number Lines

Double number lines offer another visual representation for proportional relationships. They show two quantities aligned on parallel number lines, with corresponding values vertically aligned.

For example, for the conversion 1 mile = 1.6 kilometres:

Miles:       0 ----- 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5
             |       |       |       |       |       |
Kilometres:  0 ----- 1.6 --- 3.2 --- 4.8 --- 6.4 --- 8

Double number lines help pupils see the proportional relationship and support informal strategies for finding missing values before formal algebraic methods are introduced.

## Common Misconceptions and How to Address Them

### Additive vs Multiplicative Reasoning

Perhaps the most significant misconception in ratio and proportion is the tendency to use additive reasoning where multiplicative reasoning is required. This is particularly evident in problems involving scaling.

**Example:** A rectangle has sides in the ratio 2:3. The short side is 4cm. How long is the long side?

**Misconception:** "2 + 2 = 4, so add 2 to 3 to get 5cm."

**Correct reasoning:** "The scale factor is 4 ÷ 2 = 2. The long side is 3 × 2 = 6cm."

Teachers should explicitly teach pupils to identify whether a problem requires additive or multiplicative reasoning. Strategies include:
- Asking: "Are we combining quantities (addition) or scaling quantities (multiplication)?"
- Using visual representations that make the multiplicative structure explicit
- Providing contrasting examples that require different types of reasoning

### Ratio Notation Errors

Pupils often struggle with the conventions of ratio notation:

**Misconception 1:** Writing ratios with addition signs instead of colons (2+3 instead of 2:3)

**Misconception 2:** Believing that ratios must compare quantities of the same unit (they can, but don't have to)

**Misconception 3:** Assuming that simplified ratios must have whole numbers (the ratio 1:1.5 is valid and useful)

Mr-Mathematics (2024) notes that "when writing ratios into the form 1:n students incorrectly assume that n has to be an integer or greater than 1." Teachers should provide examples where n is a decimal or fraction to challenge this assumption.

### Part-Part vs Part-Whole Confusion

Pupils often confuse part:part ratios with part:whole (fraction) representations.

If the ratio of boys to girls is 3:4:
- The fraction of boys is 3/7 (not 3/4)
- The fraction of girls is 4/7 (not 4/3)

Explicit teaching of the distinction between part:part and part:whole, supported by visual representations, helps pupils navigate between ratio and fraction notation.

### Inverse Proportion Misconceptions

Inverse proportion is particularly challenging because the relationship is less intuitive than direct proportion. Common misconceptions include:

**Misconception:** If one quantity doubles, the other doubles (this is direct proportion)

**Correct understanding:** If one quantity doubles, the other halves (inverse proportion)

Teachers should use real-world contexts to develop intuition: "If 4 workers take 6 hours to complete a job, how long would 8 workers take?" Pupils can reason that with twice as many workers, the job should take half the time.

### The "Constant Sum" Error

In problems involving unequal sharing, pupils sometimes incorrectly assume that the quantities should add up to the total in an additive way.

**Example:** Share £20 in the ratio 2:3.

**Misconception:** £20 ÷ 2 = £10 and £20 ÷ 3 = £6.67 (failing to recognise that 2:3 represents parts of a whole)

**Correct reasoning:** Total parts = 2 + 3 = 5. Each part = £20 ÷ 5 = £4. The shares are £8 and £12.

Emphasising that ratios describe how a total is divided, and that the ratio parts must sum to give the total number of parts, helps address this misconception.

## Progression Across Key Stages

### Early Years and Key Stage 1

Whilst ratio and proportion are not explicitly named in the Early Years Foundation Stage or Key Stage 1 programmes of study, foundational concepts are developed through:

- Sharing equally (division as sharing)
- Comparing quantities (more than, less than, twice as many)
- Patterns and sequences
- Simple scaling (doubling, halving)

Teachers can lay groundwork for later formal ratio work through activities that involve comparing quantities and exploring multiplicative relationships.

### Lower Key Stage 2 (Years 3-4)

Pupils continue to develop multiplicative thinking through:
- Multiplication and division facts
- Scaling problems involving measures
- Fractions as parts of a whole

The NCETM curriculum prioritisation materials suggest that Year 4 pupils should work on multiplicative relationships, recognising that "multiplication and division facts are related and can be derived from one another."

### Upper Key Stage 2 (Years 5-6)

Year 6 is when ratio and proportion are formally introduced. The NCETM's Year 6 curriculum prioritisation unit on ratio and proportion emphasises:

- Solving problems involving unequal quantities using multiplication and division
- Connecting ratio to fractions and percentages
- Using the language of ratio in context

Third Space Learning (2025) notes that the statutory requirements include solving "problems involving the relative sizes of 2 quantities where missing values can be found by using integer multiplication and division facts."

### Key Stage 3

At Key Stage 3, the focus shifts to:
- Formal ratio notation and simplification
- Connecting ratios to fractions and linear functions
- Direct and inverse proportion
- Percentage change
- Scale drawings and maps

The Oak National Academy's Key Stage 3 unit on "Understanding multiplicative relationships: fractions and ratio" emphasises that pupils should understand that "a multiplicative relationship between two quantities can be expressed as a ratio or a fraction."

### Key Stage 4

At GCSE, ratio and proportion problems become more complex and may involve:
- Algebraic representation of proportional relationships (y = kx, y = k/x)
- Compound measures and rates of change
- Similarity and congruence in geometry
- Complex proportion problems in context

Exam boards including AQA, Edexcel, and WJEC all assess ratio and proportion extensively, with questions often set in real-world contexts.

## Teaching Strategies and Classroom Approaches

### Use Concrete Resources

Even in secondary settings, concrete resources can support understanding of ratio and proportion:

- **Cuisenaire rods** – Different colours represent different values, making ratio relationships visible
- **Algebra tiles** – Support the link between concrete representations and abstract algebra
- **Measuring equipment** – Practical work with scales, jugs, and rulers develops proportional intuition

### Contextualised Learning

Ratio and proportion are most meaningful when taught through contexts that pupils recognise:

- **Recipes and cooking** – Scaling ingredients up and down
- **Maps and scale drawings** – Understanding scale factors
- **Shopping and value for money** – Comparing prices
- **Speed, distance, time** – Compound measures involving rates
- **Paint mixing and colour ratios** – Real-world ratio applications

### Mathematical Talk

Encouraging pupils to articulate their thinking about ratio and proportion helps develop understanding and reveals misconceptions:

- "Explain why you multiplied rather than added"
- "What is the same and what is different about these two ratios?"
- "How could you check your answer makes sense?"
- "Can you express this relationship in a different way?"

The NCETM's Teaching for Mastery approach emphasises the importance of oracy in developing mathematical understanding.

### Varied Practice

Providing a range of problem types helps pupils develop flexible thinking:

- **Missing value problems** – Find the unknown in a proportional relationship
- **Comparison problems** – Determine which ratio represents better value
- **Construction problems** – Create shapes or mixtures with given ratios
- **Explanation problems** – Justify why a relationship is or is not proportional

### Diagnostic Questions

Using carefully designed multiple-choice questions can reveal misconceptions:

*"Which of these is a correct method for solving: The ratio of red to blue counters is 2:5. There are 14 red counters. How many blue counters are there?"

A) 14 ÷ 2 = 7, then 5 + 7 = 12
B) 14 ÷ 2 = 7, then 5 × 7 = 35
C) 14 + 5 = 19
D) 5 - 2 = 3, then 14 + 3 = 17*

Option A reveals the "constant sum" error. Option B is correct. Options C and D show a lack of understanding of ratio structure.

## Assessment of Ratio and Proportion

### Formative Assessment Strategies

Teachers can use a range of strategies to assess understanding:

- **Hinge questions** – Quick multiple-choice questions to check understanding before moving on
- **Mini-whiteboards** – Whole-class responses to reveal common errors
- **Think-pair-share** – Opportunities for pupils to articulate their reasoning
- **Error spotting** – Presenting worked solutions with deliberate errors for pupils to identify and correct

### Summative Assessment

At Key Stage 2, ratio and proportion appear in the mathematics SATs, typically as problem-solving questions. At GCSE, ratio and proportion questions can appear on both Foundation and Higher tiers, with more complex inverse proportion and algebraic representation on Higher tier papers.

### Common Assessment Pitfalls

Teachers should be aware that:
- Procedural fluency with ratio notation does not guarantee conceptual understanding
- Pupils may perform well on routine problems but struggle with unfamiliar contexts
- Multi-step problems reveal gaps in understanding that single-step problems mask

## Conclusion

Ratio and proportion are foundational mathematical concepts that pupils encounter throughout their mathematical education and in everyday life. Effective teaching requires attention to the progression from additive to multiplicative reasoning, the use of visual representations such as bar models and ratio tables, and explicit attention to common misconceptions.

The National Curriculum provides a clear progression from informal exploration in the early years through to formal algebraic representation at GCSE. Teachers who understand this progression, who can identify and address misconceptions, and who use a range of representations and contexts will best support their pupils in developing deep and lasting understanding of these crucial concepts.

As the NCETM emphasises, the goal is not merely procedural fluency but conceptual understanding that enables pupils to recognise and apply multiplicative relationships in new and unfamiliar contexts. This requires careful curriculum design, responsive teaching that addresses emerging misconceptions, and a commitment to developing mathematical talk and reasoning in the classroom.
