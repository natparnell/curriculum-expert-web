# Problem-Solving Strategies and Approaches Across Key Stages

## Introduction: The Centrality of Problem Solving in Mathematics Education

Problem solving stands as one of the three fundamental aims of the National Curriculum for Mathematics in England, alongside fluency and reasoning. Since the introduction of the 2014 National Curriculum, problem solving has been explicitly positioned not as an optional extension activity but as core mathematical capability that pupils must develop progressively from the Early Years Foundation Stage through to Key Stage 4 and beyond.

The DfE's statutory guidance makes clear that pupils should "develop fluency, mathematical reasoning and competence in solving increasingly sophisticated problems" (DfE, 2021). This tripartite formulation recognises that problem solving is not merely the application of already-learned procedures but a complex cognitive activity that interweaves declarative knowledge (facts and concepts), procedural knowledge (methods and algorithms), and conditional knowledge (knowing when and why to apply particular approaches).

Ofsted's research review on mathematics (2021) emphasised that pupils cannot become problem solvers simply by imitating expert behaviour. Rather, problem-solving strategies must be explicitly taught, practised systematically, and applied across diverse contexts. The review noted that effective mathematics curricula combine declarative and procedural knowledge as strategies for problem solving, ensuring that pupils develop both the tools and the strategic awareness to deploy them appropriately.

This knowledge file examines problem-solving strategies and approaches across the key stages, drawing upon statutory requirements, research evidence from NCETM and academic sources, and pedagogical approaches including those developed through the England-China Mathematics Teacher Exchange and Singapore mathematics programmes that have influenced UK practice.

## The National Curriculum Framework for Problem Solving

### Statutory Requirements by Key Stage

#### Early Years Foundation Stage (Ages 3-5)

Whilst the EYFS Statutory Framework does not explicitly separate subjects, the Mathematics Early Learning Goal establishes foundations for problem solving through the Development Matters guidance. Children are expected to develop "positive attitudes and interests in mathematics" and look for patterns and relationships, spotting connections (DfE, 2021).

The Characteristics of Effective Teaching and Learning—playing and exploring, active learning, and creating and thinking critically—provide the pedagogical framework within which early problem solving emerges. Practitioners are encouraged to spot mathematical opportunities in everyday experiences, encouraging children to think of their own solutions rather than immediately providing answers.

#### Key Stage 1 (Ages 5-7)

The Key Stage 1 programme of study requires that pupils "solve problems by applying their mathematics to a variety of routine and non-routine problems with increasing sophistication, including breaking down problems into a series of simpler steps and persevering in seeking solutions" (DfE, 2013).

At this stage, problem solving is explicitly connected to number and place value, addition and subtraction, multiplication and division, fractions, measurement, and geometry. The expectation is that pupils will encounter problems in varied contexts, developing flexibility in their application of mathematical knowledge.

#### Key Stage 2 (Ages 7-11)

The Key Stage 2 programme extends these expectations, requiring pupils to solve problems across all mathematical domains including algebra, ratio and proportion, statistics, and more complex geometry. The curriculum emphasises that pupils should "use rounding to check answers to calculations and determine, in the context of a problem, levels of accuracy" (DfE, 2013).

By the end of Key Stage 2, pupils are expected to handle multi-step problems, select appropriate calculation strategies, and use estimation to evaluate the reasonableness of their answers. The Year 6 statutory tests include specific problem-solving elements that assess these capabilities.

#### Key Stage 3 (Ages 11-14)

The Key Stage 3 programme of study, updated in 2021 with accompanying non-statutory guidance developed with NCETM, maintains the tripartite aims of fluency, reasoning, and problem solving. Pupils should "build on key stage 2 and connections across mathematical ideas to develop fluency, mathematical reasoning and competence in solving increasingly sophisticated problems" (DfE, 2021).

The Key Stage 3 non-statutory guidance specifically addresses problem solving through its focus on mathematical thinking and the development of systematic approaches. It emphasises that problem solving at this stage should involve mathematical modelling, the selection and evaluation of strategies, and the communication of reasoning.

#### Key Stage 4 (Ages 14-16)

At Key Stage 4, the programme of study explicitly separates the aims into three strands: develop fluency, reason mathematically, and solve problems. The problem-solving strand requires pupils to "develop their mathematical knowledge, in part through solving problems and evaluating the outcomes, including multi-step problems" (DfE, 2014).

The GCSE mathematics specifications from all awarding bodies assess problem solving through Assessment Objectives that require students to "make deductions, inferences and draw conclusions from mathematical information" and "construct chains of reasoning to achieve a given result" (Ofqual, 2022).

### The Three Aims: Fluency, Reasoning, and Problem Solving

The National Curriculum presents these three aims as interconnected rather than sequential. NCETM's professional development materials emphasise that fluency alone is insufficient—pupils must develop "relational understanding" (Skemp, 1976) that enables them to know when and why to apply particular procedures.

Ofsted's research review (2021) critiqued approaches that treat problem solving as the final stage of a linear progression from fluency through reasoning. Instead, the review advocated for an integrated approach in which problems can serve as contexts for developing fluency and reasoning, not merely as applications of previously learned content.

## Pólya's Framework and its Influence on Mathematics Education

### The Four-Stage Model

George Pólya's seminal work "How to Solve It" (1945) established a framework for mathematical problem solving that remains influential in classrooms worldwide, including UK mathematics education. Pólya proposed four stages that provide a metacognitive scaffold for approaching mathematical problems:

**Understanding the Problem**
Pólya emphasised that many failures in problem solving stem from insufficient attention to understanding what is being asked. Pupils should identify the unknown, the data, and the condition; draw a figure or introduce suitable notation; and consider whether they have seen a similar problem before.

**Devising a Plan**
Once the problem is understood, pupils must select or devise a strategy for solution. Pólya catalogued numerous heuristics including working backwards, considering special cases, solving a simpler problem, using direct reasoning, and looking for patterns.

**Carrying Out the Plan**
This stage involves executing the chosen strategy with careful attention to accuracy and systematic working. Pólya noted that pupils must maintain flexibility—if the plan proves unworkable, they should be prepared to return to the planning stage.

**Looking Back**
The final stage, often neglected in classroom practice, involves reviewing the solution, checking the result, considering alternative approaches, and reflecting on what has been learned. Pólya argued that this metacognitive reflection is essential for developing problem-solving expertise.

### Critiques and Adaptations

Whilst Pólya's framework provides a valuable scaffold, mathematics education researchers have noted limitations. Schoenfeld (1985) demonstrated that expert problem solving involves not merely following steps but making dynamic decisions based on monitoring and self-regulation. The four-stage model may oversimplify the messy, recursive nature of authentic mathematical problem solving.

Contemporary UK approaches, influenced by Singapore mathematics and teaching for mastery, often adapt Pólya's framework into more classroom-friendly formats. The "Singapore Bar Method," for instance, provides a concrete visual strategy that supports the "devising a plan" stage, particularly for word problems involving part-whole relationships or comparison situations.

NCETM's professional development materials emphasise that Pólya's stages should not be taught as a rigid procedure but as flexible thinking tools. The bar model, for example, is presented not merely as a diagramming technique but as a way of structuring understanding and planning solution strategies.

## Key Problem-Solving Strategies and Heuristics

### Visual Representation Strategies

**The Bar Model Method**
Originating from Singapore mathematics and now widely adopted in England through the mastery movement, the bar model provides a visual representation strategy for structuring word problems. The method uses rectangular bars to represent known and unknown quantities, making relationships visible and supporting the transition from concrete to abstract thinking.

For part-whole problems, the bar represents the whole divided into parts. For comparison problems, bars of different lengths show the relationships between quantities. The method is particularly powerful for problems involving fractions, ratios, and percentages, providing a consistent representational approach across these related domains.

NCETM guidance recommends introducing bar modelling in Key Stage 1 with concrete materials (Cuisenaire rods, strips of paper) before progressing to pictorial representations and eventually abstract application. The method supports all three National Curriculum aims: it develops fluency through consistent representation, supports reasoning by making relationships visible, and enables problem solving by providing a planning scaffold.

**Other Visual Strategies**
Beyond bar modelling, effective problem solvers employ various visual representations including diagrams, tables, graphs, and number lines. The choice of representation depends on the problem structure—number lines for sequencing and comparison problems, tables for organising data in pattern-spotting problems, graphs for relationships between variables.

### Systematic Working Strategies

**Working Systematically**
Many mathematical problems require systematic approaches to ensure all possibilities are considered. This strategy involves developing and following a methodical procedure, often with recording to track progress. NRICH activities frequently emphasise systematic working, providing problems where random trial-and-error approaches are inefficient or prone to error.

**Working Backwards**
For problems where the final state is known but initial conditions are unknown, working backwards can provide an efficient solution path. This strategy appears in problems involving inverse operations, reverse calculations, and certain types of word problems.

**Trial and Improvement**
Particularly for problems where an exact answer cannot be calculated directly, trial and improvement provides a legitimate strategy. Pupils should learn to make systematic trials, evaluate results, and refine their approach based on feedback. This strategy connects to computational thinking and numerical methods encountered at Key Stage 4 and beyond.

### Pattern Recognition and Generalisation

**Spotting Patterns**
Mathematical problems often involve numerical, spatial, or geometric patterns. Expert problem solvers attend to pattern from the outset, looking for regularities that might suggest solution strategies or lead to generalisations. The National Curriculum explicitly requires pupils to identify patterns and relationships from Key Stage 1 onwards.

**Conjecturing and Generalising**
Beyond merely spotting patterns, sophisticated problem solving involves making and testing conjectures about pattern continuation. Pupils should learn to express generalisations algebraically where appropriate, recognising that a general formula often emerges from examining multiple specific cases.

### Logical Reasoning Strategies

**Elimination and Deduction**
For problems where constraints limit possibilities, logical elimination can efficiently narrow the solution space. This strategy connects to logical reasoning requirements in the Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3 programmes of study and underpins many Sudoku-style and logic puzzle problems.

**Proof and Justification**
Whilst formal proof belongs primarily to Key Stage 4 and beyond, elements of justification and convincing argument appear throughout the primary and secondary curriculum. Pupils should learn to support their solutions with reasoning, explaining not merely what they did but why their approach is valid.

## Pedagogical Approaches to Developing Problem Solvers

### Explicit Strategy Instruction

Ofsted's research review (2021) made clear that problem-solving strategies must be explicitly taught rather than assumed to develop through exposure alone. This explicit instruction includes:

**Naming and Explaining Strategies**
Teachers should name strategies clearly—"We are going to work systematically," "Let's try drawing a diagram"—so pupils develop a repertoire of known approaches. Each strategy should be explained, modelled, and practised in controlled contexts before application to complex problems.

**Metacognitive Scaffolding**
Effective problem-solving instruction includes metacognitive prompts: "What do you notice?" "What do you already know that might help?" "Is your strategy working? Should you try something different?" These prompts develop pupils' capacity to monitor and regulate their own problem-solving processes.

**Worked Examples and Completion Problems**
Research on cognitive load theory supports the use of fully worked examples for novice problem solvers, gradually transitioning to completion problems (partially worked solutions) and finally independent problem solving. This fading of support aligns with the mastery principle that all pupils should access the same ambitious content, with scaffolding provided as needed.

### Variation Theory and Problem Design

**Intelligent Practice**
NCETM and Maths Hubs professional development emphasises the importance of "intelligent practice"—sequences of problems that develop fluency through variation rather than mere repetition. In well-designed variation sequences, problems change systematically, drawing attention to mathematical structure and preparing pupils for problem solving.

**Standard and Non-Standard Problems**
The National Curriculum requires competence in both routine problems (where solution methods are apparent from the problem structure) and non-routine problems (where pupils must devise their own approach). Effective curricula balance these types, ensuring pupils develop both procedural fluency and adaptive expertise.

**Low Threshold, High Ceiling Tasks**
NRICH and similar resources provide problems accessible to all pupils whilst offering extension for the most able. Such tasks support mixed-attainment teaching and the mastery principle that the majority of pupils should move through the curriculum together, with differentiation through depth rather than acceleration.

### The Role of Talk and Collaboration

**Mathematical Dialogue**
The NCETM's "Five Big Ideas" of teaching for mastery include "mathematical thinking" and "representation and structure," both of which are developed through classroom talk. Pupils should articulate their problem-solving strategies, explain their reasoning, and respond to the approaches of others.

**Collaborative Problem Solving**
Working in pairs or small groups on challenging problems can develop problem-solving capabilities. However, Ofsted noted that collaborative work is most effective when structured carefully, with clear individual accountability and opportunities for all pupils to contribute mathematical thinking.

## Problem Solving Across the Key Stages: Progression and Pedagogy

### Early Years and Key Stage 1: Foundations

In the Early Years, problem solving emerges through play and exploration. Practitioners pose genuine problems within meaningful contexts: "We need a table for the teddy bears' picnic. How many plates do we need?" "Can you find a way to make this tower taller?"

Key Stage 1 builds these foundations through concrete and pictorial experiences. The CPA (Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract) approach, derived from Singapore mathematics but now embedded in English mastery programmes, ensures that problem solving is grounded in physical manipulation before abstract representation.

Common misconceptions at this stage include:
- Assuming the operation required matches the most recent lesson topic
- Difficulty with multi-step problems requiring more than one operation
- Treating all problems as requiring immediate calculation rather than reflection

Effective pedagogy includes:
- Providing manipulatives for all pupils, not just those who struggle
- Encouraging pupils to represent problems in their own way before introducing standard methods
- Celebrating multiple solution approaches
- Developing mathematical vocabulary for describing strategies

### Key Stage 2: Developing Systematic Approaches

Key Stage 2 represents a crucial period for developing systematic problem-solving approaches. Pupils encounter more complex multi-step problems, problems involving multiple mathematical domains, and problems requiring selection from among multiple possible strategies.

The Year 6 SATs include arithmetic and reasoning papers that assess problem-solving capability. Analysis of past papers reveals common patterns: problems combining multiple operations, problems requiring conversion between units, problems involving scaling and proportion, and problems where the operation is not immediately apparent.

NCETM's Primary Mastery Professional Development materials provide detailed guidance on developing problem solving through the key stage. The materials emphasise:
- Building fluency and problem solving together rather than sequentially
- Using variation to develop both procedural fluency and conceptual understanding
- Providing regular opportunities for problem solving across all mathematical domains

### Key Stage 3: Connecting and Applying

The transition to Key Stage 3 brings increased complexity in both content and problem types. Pupils encounter algebra as a problem-solving tool, proportional reasoning in varied contexts, and geometric problems requiring construction and proof elements.

The non-statutory guidance for Key Stage 3, developed with NCETM, emphasises that problem solving at this stage should:
- Draw connections between mathematical ideas (e.g., linking ratio with algebra and geometry)
- Develop mathematical modelling capabilities
- Require pupils to evaluate and select appropriate strategies
- Include problems with insufficient or redundant information

The England-China Mathematics Teacher Exchange has influenced Key Stage 3 pedagogy, with many schools adopting elements of Shanghai-style teaching including:
- Carefully crafted lessons focusing on single conceptual developments
- Heavy use of variation in worked examples and practice problems
- Emphasis on precise mathematical language
- Whole-class teaching with careful questioning rather than differentiated group work

### Key Stage 4: Maturing Problem Solvers

By Key Stage 4, pupils should be developing as autonomous mathematical problem solvers capable of tackling the multi-step, unstructured problems characteristic of GCSE assessment. The three Assessment Objectives for GCSE mathematics reflect the National Curriculum aims:

- AO1: Use and apply standard techniques (fluency)
- AO2: Reason, interpret and communicate mathematically (reasoning)
- AO3: Solve problems within mathematics and in other contexts (problem solving)

AO3 problems typically require pupils to:
- Translate problems in non-mathematical contexts into mathematical processes
- Make and use connections between different parts of mathematics
- Interpret results in context
- Evaluate methods and solutions

Effective Key Stage 4 pedagogy maintains focus on problem solving throughout the course rather than treating it as revision material. Regular exposure to non-routine problems, discussion of problem-solving strategies, and explicit reflection on solution approaches all support development of mature problem-solving capabilities.

## Common Challenges and Misconceptions in Problem Solving

### Pupil-Level Challenges

**The "Cue Word" Trap**
Many pupils develop the misconception that particular words cue particular operations—"more" means add, "less" means subtract, "times" means multiply. This approach fails for multi-step problems and problems requiring inverse operations. Effective teaching addresses this explicitly, providing counterexamples and developing conceptual understanding of operations.

**Surface-Level Approaches**
Some pupils focus on surface features of problems rather than underlying structure. They may attempt to apply a recently learned procedure regardless of problem demands or focus on superficial similarities between problems rather than mathematical structure. Visual representation strategies, particularly bar modelling, help address this by making structure visible and explicit.

**Mathematical Anxiety and Avoidance**
Problem solving can provoke anxiety in pupils who have experienced repeated failure or who believe mathematical ability is fixed rather than developed through effort. Creating classroom cultures that celebrate struggle as part of learning, that separate mistakes from personal worth, and that emphasise process over speed can support anxious pupils in engaging productively with problems.

**Over-Reliance on Algorithmic Approaches**
Pupils who have experienced mathematics as a collection of procedures to memorise may struggle when faced with problems that do not map neatly onto known algorithms. Developing adaptive expertise—knowing when and how to modify procedures—requires explicit attention alongside the development of standard methods.

### Curriculum and Instructional Challenges

**Time and Coverage Pressures**
Teachers often report that problem-solving activities require more time than direct instruction, creating tension between depth and coverage. NCETM guidance suggests that time invested in deep problem-solving experiences pays dividends in developing the relational understanding that supports later progress.

**Assessment Constraints**
External assessments at Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 4 assess problem solving but within tightly controlled formats. There is a risk that teaching narrows to match assessment formats rather than developing genuine problem-solving capabilities. Regular exposure to authentic, open-ended problems alongside examination-style practice helps maintain breadth.

**Teacher Knowledge and Confidence**
Effective problem-solving instruction requires teachers themselves to be confident mathematical problem solvers. Professional development through Maths Hubs, NCETM materials, and collaborative working with colleagues supports teachers in developing both their own problem-solving capabilities and their pedagogical skill in teaching problem solving.

---

## Assessment of Problem Solving

### Formative Assessment Approaches

**Observing Problem-Solving Processes**
Effective formative assessment attends not merely to whether pupils reach correct answers but to how they approach problems. Teachers should observe and note the strategies pupils select, how they respond to obstacles, and whether they reflect on and evaluate their solutions.

**Diagnostic Questioning**
Carefully crafted questions can reveal pupils' thinking: "Why did you choose that strategy?" "What would happen if...?" "How do you know your answer is reasonable?" Such questions assess understanding beyond surface-level performance and inform responsive teaching.

**Self and Peer Assessment**
Developing pupils' capacity to assess their own and others' problem-solving work supports metacognitive development. Structured rubrics that attend to strategy selection, clarity of reasoning, and evaluation of solutions can scaffold effective self-assessment.

### Summative Assessment

**National Assessments**
The Key Stage 2 mathematics SATs include problem-solving elements within the reasoning papers, requiring pupils to apply mathematical knowledge in varied contexts, including multi-step problems. Similarly, GCSE mathematics specifications from all awarding bodies assess problem solving through dedicated Assessment Objective 3.

**Teacher Assessment**
Teacher assessment frameworks for mathematics require judgements about pupils' problem-solving capabilities. Moderation activities and shared standardisation help ensure consistency of judgement within and across schools.

## Resources for Developing Problem Solving

### NRICH
The NRICH project at the University of Cambridge provides thousands of free mathematical problems and investigations suitable for all key stages. NRICH resources are designed to develop mathematical thinking through problem solving, with problems categorised by topic and challenge level. The project's focus on "low threshold, high ceiling" tasks ensures accessibility whilst offering extension.

### NCETM Professional Development Materials
NCETM provides comprehensive professional development materials for teaching problem solving, including spine materials that develop mathematical concepts through carefully sequenced problem-solving experiences. The Primary Mastery Professional Development materials include specific guidance on developing problem solving across all mathematical domains.

### Textbook and Scheme Resources
Teaching for mastery textbook schemes (Maths — No Problem!, Power Maths, White Rose Maths) embed problem solving throughout their materials rather than treating it as a separate topic. These resources provide coherent sequences of problems that develop both procedural fluency and conceptual understanding.

### Examination Board Resources
GCSE examination boards provide problem-solving resources focused on the AO3 requirements. These include collections of non-routine problems, problem-solving strategies guidance, and marked exemplars illustrating different performance levels.

## Conclusion: Towards Expertise in Problem Solving

Developing mathematical problem solvers is a long-term endeavour that spans pupils' entire mathematical education. Effective approaches recognise that problem solving is not a single skill but a complex set of capabilities involving knowledge of strategies, conditional awareness of when to apply them, metacognitive monitoring of solution processes, and the disposition to persist through difficulty.

The National Curriculum's positioning of problem solving as one of three core aims, supported by NCETM professional development and informed by international approaches such as Singapore mathematics and Shanghai teaching, provides a coherent framework for developing these capabilities. Success requires sustained attention across all key stages, explicit teaching of strategies alongside mathematical content, and the creation of classroom cultures that value thinking, struggle, and growth.

As pupils progress from Early Years exploration through to the sophisticated demands of GCSE and beyond, they should develop not merely the ability to solve particular problems but the capacity to approach unfamiliar problems with confidence, selecting and adapting strategies flexibly, and reflecting on their learning to develop ever-more-powerful problem-solving capabilities.
