# Mathematical Association

## Overview

The **Mathematical Association (MA)** is the United Kingdom's oldest professional organisation dedicated to mathematics education, founded in 1871 as the Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching (AIGT). With a history spanning more than 150 years, the MA has played a pivotal role in shaping mathematics pedagogy, curriculum development, and teacher professional development across all key stages in England, Wales, and beyond. As a registered charity (number 1117838), the Association exists to "bring about improvements in the teaching of mathematics and its applications, and to provide a means of communication among students and teachers of mathematics."

The MA represents a unique bridge between academic mathematics and classroom practice, bringing together university mathematicians, teacher educators, classroom practitioners, and policymakers in a shared mission to advance mathematics education. Its enduring influence stems from this ability to unite theoretical rigour with practical classroom wisdom, making it an essential resource for mathematics educators seeking to deepen their subject knowledge and refine their pedagogical approaches.

## Historical Origins and Foundation

### The Euclid Problem: Catalyst for Reform

The Mathematical Association emerged from a specific and pressing educational controversy of the Victorian era: the dominance of **Euclid's Elements** as the sole acceptable geometry textbook in English schools and universities. Throughout the nineteenth century, Euclid's ancient text, written around 300 BCE, was treated not merely as a geometry course but as the *only* proper way to teach and examine geometrical knowledge. University entrance examinations, including those at Oxford and Cambridge, explicitly required candidates to reproduce Euclid's propositions in strict order, using his particular formulations and methods.

This rigid adherence to Euclid created significant pedagogical problems. The text's logical structure, whilst mathematically elegant, was pedagogically challenging. Students were forced to learn geometry through a sequence of propositions that did not reflect how mathematical understanding naturally develops. The emphasis on rote memorisation of proofs, rather than on developing spatial reasoning and problem-solving capabilities, meant that many students emerged from their geometrical studies with little genuine understanding of the subject.

Educational reformers had long criticised this system. As early as the 1830s, mathematicians and educators had begun questioning whether Euclid was truly the best vehicle for teaching geometry to school pupils. However, the vested interests of the examination boards and the conservative nature of British academic institutions made change difficult. The universities controlled the examinations, and the examinations dictated the curriculum. Breaking this cycle required organised collective action.

### Formation of the Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching (1871)

The **first Annual Meeting of the Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching** took place on **Tuesday 17 January 1871 at University College, London**. Chaired by **Thomas Archer Hirst**, the meeting brought together mathematics teachers from schools and universities who shared a commitment to reforming geometry teaching. The Association's founding purpose was explicit: to develop and lobby for alternatives to the standard Euclid-based treatment of geometry.

The founders of the AIGT were not radical iconoclasts seeking to discard classical learning. Rather, they were pragmatic educators who recognised that Euclid's *mathematics* could be separated from Euclid's *pedagogy*. They believed that geometrical concepts could be taught more effectively using modern textbooks that presented the same mathematical content in ways more suited to the developing minds of school pupils.

The early years of the Association were dedicated to practical reform efforts. Members produced alternative geometry textbooks that maintained mathematical rigour whilst improving pedagogical accessibility. They lobbied examination boards to accept proofs and methods not found in Euclid's exact formulation. They conducted demonstrations of new teaching methods and shared experiences from the classroom. The Association's journal, initially titled the *Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching Reports*, provided a forum for discussing these innovations.

### The Campaign to "Break the Fetters of Euclid"

The Association's campaign against the Euclid monopoly was protracted and required sustained advocacy over several decades. Reformers faced significant opposition from traditionalists who viewed any deviation from Euclid as a lowering of standards. The argument that Euclid had "trained the mind" for over two thousand years was powerful in an educational culture that valued classical learning highly.

However, the AIGT reformers amassed compelling evidence that alternative approaches could produce better mathematical understanding. They showed that students taught with modern methods could solve geometrical problems more effectively than those drilled in Euclidean memorisation. They demonstrated that the logical structure of geometry could be preserved without slavish adherence to Euclid's particular sequencing and phraseology.

**The decisive victory came in 1904**, when the universities finally removed the requirement that geometry examinations follow Euclid's order and methods. This change, described by reformers as "breaking the fetters of Euclid," marked the end of the ancient text's monopoly and the beginning of a more flexible approach to geometry teaching. The Mathematical Association had achieved its founding purpose, but rather than disbanding, it evolved to address the broader challenges of mathematics education.

### Expansion and Renaming (1897)

As the Association's interests expanded beyond geometry to encompass all aspects of mathematics teaching, a name change became appropriate. In **1897**, the Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching became the **Mathematical Association**. This renaming reflected both the success of the original geometrical reform campaign and a broadening vision that encompassed arithmetic, algebra, mechanics, and the full range of school mathematics.

The renamed Association continued to grow in membership and influence. In **1894**, it had launched **The Mathematical Gazette**, which would become one of the world's most respected journals in mathematics education. The Gazette provided a forum for discussing teaching methods, sharing mathematical insights, and reviewing educational developments. Its readership included school teachers, university lecturers, and educationalists, creating the cross-sector dialogue that remains a hallmark of the Association.

## Evolution Through the Twentieth Century

### The Early Decades: Establishing Professional Identity

The Mathematical Association's early decades as a general mathematics education body were marked by efforts to establish a professional identity for mathematics teachers and to develop a coherent vision for school mathematics. The Association worked to raise the status of mathematics teaching as a profession, advocating for better teacher training and improved conditions for mathematics educators.

In **March 1927**, the Association held a three-day meeting in **Grantham** to commemorate the bicentenary of the death of **Sir Isaac Newton**. This prestigious gathering, attended by leading figures including **Sir J. J. Thomson** (discoverer of the electron), **Sir Frank Watson Dyson** (the Astronomer Royal), **Sir Horace Lamb**, and **G. H. Hardy**, demonstrated the Association's growing stature. Such events brought cutting-edge mathematical developments to the attention of school teachers and reinforced the connection between research mathematics and school-level education.

The Association also developed its organisational structure during this period. Local branches were established across England, allowing members to meet regularly for professional development and networking. These branches often organised lecture programmes, workshops, and social events that sustained professional community among mathematics teachers.

### Mid-Century Developments: Comprehensive Education and Mathematical Reform

The post-World War II period brought significant changes to English education, and the Mathematical Association was actively involved in many of these developments. The introduction of comprehensive education and the raising of the school leaving age created new challenges for mathematics teaching. The Association contributed to discussions about curriculum reform and the development of new examination systems.

In **1951**, **Mary Cartwright** became the **first female president** of the Mathematical Association, marking a significant milestone in the organisation's history. Cartwright, a distinguished mathematician who had made fundamental contributions to the theory of differential equations, exemplified the Association's commitment to high-level mathematics alongside educational concerns. Her presidency opened the door for greater female leadership within the organisation and reflected the growing number of women in mathematics education.

The 1960s saw intense debates about comprehensive education and selective schooling. The Mathematical Association took a controversial position during this period, **supporting the retention of the 11-plus system**. This stance reflected the views of many mathematics teachers who believed that selective schooling allowed for more effective differentiation of mathematical instruction. However, the Association continued to engage constructively with comprehensive reform, recognising that mathematics teaching needed to adapt to new organisational realities.

During this period, the Association also developed professional qualifications for mathematics teachers. The **Diploma of the Mathematical Association** (later renamed the Diploma in Mathematical Education of the Mathematical Association) provided a respected qualification for teachers seeking to demonstrate advanced expertise in mathematics pedagogy. This diploma was examined and recognised by universities and employers, contributing to the professionalisation of mathematics teaching.

### The Late Twentieth Century: New Challenges

The latter decades of the twentieth century brought further curriculum changes, including the introduction of the National Curriculum in 1988. The Mathematical Association played an active role in consultations about the mathematics National Curriculum, advocating for coherent progression and appropriate challenge across key stages. The organisation continued to produce influential publications and to organise professional development events for teachers adapting to new curricular requirements.

The Association also responded to technological changes affecting mathematics education. The advent of calculators and, later, computers raised fundamental questions about what aspects of mathematics remained essential for students to learn. The MA provided forums for debating these issues and for sharing practical strategies for integrating technology into mathematics teaching whilst preserving mathematical understanding.

**Primary Mathematics** is the Mathematical Association's journal dedicated to mathematics teaching in the primary phase. Published three times per year, this journal addresses the specific needs and challenges of primary mathematics educators, providing practical ideas for the classroom alongside deeper reflection on mathematical learning in the early years.

The journal covers all aspects of primary mathematics teaching, from number sense and calculation strategies to geometry, measurement, and data handling. Articles often include classroom activities that teachers can adapt for their own settings, alongside theoretical discussion of how young children develop mathematical understanding. The emphasis is always on developing conceptual understanding rather than mere procedural fluency.

Primary Mathematics serves an increasingly important function as primary teachers are expected to teach mathematics to higher standards whilst often lacking specialist mathematical training. The journal helps non-specialist teachers develop their subject knowledge and pedagogical confidence, making it an essential resource for primary mathematics coordinators and classroom teachers alike.

### Mathematics in School

**Mathematics in School** is the Association's journal for secondary mathematics educators, published five times per year. This journal focuses on the practical challenges of teaching mathematics in secondary schools, from Key Stage 3 through to A Level. It combines lesson ideas, resource reviews, and discussion of curriculum and assessment developments with reflection on pedagogical principles.

The journal has been particularly influential in supporting teachers through periods of curriculum change. When new GCSE or A Level specifications are introduced, Mathematics in School typically publishes detailed analyses and practical guidance for teachers adapting their practice. The journal also maintains a focus on the use of technology in mathematics teaching, reviewing software and hardware developments and sharing innovative uses of digital tools.

Mathematics in School's practical orientation makes it particularly valuable for busy classroom teachers seeking immediately applicable ideas. However, the journal also publishes more reflective pieces that encourage teachers to think deeply about their practice and the nature of mathematical learning.

### MA Members Magazine

In addition to its subject-specific journals, the Mathematical Association produces a **Members Magazine** that keeps the membership informed about Association activities, conferences, and developments in mathematics education policy. This publication helps maintain the sense of professional community that has always been central to the MA's identity.
