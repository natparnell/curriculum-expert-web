# Ofsted Mathematics: Research Review and Subject Report

## Overview

Ofsted, the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills, plays a pivotal role in shaping mathematics education in England through its comprehensive research reviews and subject reports. The organisation's influential publications—particularly the **Research Review Series: Mathematics** (May 2021) and **Coordinating Mathematical Success: The Mathematics Subject Report** (July 2023)—provide evidence-based guidance that has fundamentally influenced how mathematics is taught, assessed, and inspected in English schools.

These publications emerged from extensive analysis of research literature, routine inspections of 50 schools between September 2021 and November 2022, and consideration of the broader challenges facing mathematics education. They establish clear expectations for curriculum quality, pedagogical approaches, and the systems schools should develop to support effective mathematics teaching across all key stages.

## Historical Context and Previous Reports

### The Evolution of Ofsted's Mathematics Guidance

Ofsted's engagement with mathematics education has evolved considerably over the past two decades. The organisation's previous major mathematics subject report, **"Made to Measure"** (2012), identified widespread weaknesses in curriculum guidance and ongoing professional development for staff. At that time, very few schools provided curricular guidance underpinned by professional development focused on enhancing subject knowledge and expertise in teaching mathematics.

The transformation between 2012 and 2023 represents one of the most significant shifts in mathematics education policy and practice in recent history. Where "Made to Measure" found fragmented approaches and inconsistent implementation, the 2023 subject report identifies widespread improvements in curriculum design, collaborative professional development, and subject-specific continuing professional development (CPD).

### The COVID-19 Context

Both the 2021 research review and 2023 subject report were developed against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools faced unprecedented challenges during the evidence-gathering period, including remote learning, lockdowns, and national restrictions that affected pupil progress and attainment. National reference test data from 2021 did not follow established trends, likely due to pandemic impacts, though results from 2022 suggested attainment was improving again.

Ofsted acknowledges that some evidence gathered during this period may not represent 'business as usual.' However, by focusing on curriculum and its implementation over time, the organisation aimed to reduce the risk of atypical findings skewing results. The reports therefore provide guidance suited to both pandemic recovery and long-term improvement.

## The Research Review Series: Mathematics (2021)

### Purpose and Scope

Published on 25 May 2021, the **Research Review Series: Mathematics** represents Ofsted's comprehensive analysis of literature relating to mathematics education in English schools. The review's purpose was to identify factors contributing to high-quality school mathematics curriculums, assessment, pedagogy, and systems. Unlike the subsequent subject report, which examines actual practice in schools, the research review synthesises findings from academic research and established best practice.

The review was designed to inform Ofsted's inspection methodology and provide schools with clarity about the organisation's conception of quality in mathematics education. It explicitly states that there is no single way of achieving high quality, recognising that different schools may legitimately adopt varying approaches whilst meeting the same fundamental standards.

### The Three Types of Mathematical Knowledge

A foundational contribution of the 2021 research review is its categorisation of mathematical knowledge into three distinct types. These terms—**declarative**, **procedural**, and **conditional** knowledge—are used as analytical tools by Ofsted rather than expected vocabulary for teachers or pupils.

#### Declarative Knowledge

Declarative knowledge encompasses facts, concepts, and formulae that pupils can recall and articulate. This knowledge can be prefaced with the sentence stem "I know that..." and includes number facts, mathematical properties, and established relationships between mathematical entities.

Examples of declarative knowledge include:
- Multiplication tables and number bonds
- Properties of geometric shapes
- Algebraic formulae and identities
- Mathematical definitions and vocabulary

The research review emphasises that declarative knowledge should not be taught through rote memorisation alone. Instead, pupils should develop understanding of why facts are true and how they connect to other mathematical concepts. Automatic recall of key facts reduces cognitive load, enabling pupils to focus on more complex problem-solving activities.

#### Procedural Knowledge

Procedural knowledge consists of methods, procedures, and algorithms—the sequences of steps used to solve mathematical problems. This knowledge can be prefaced with "I know how..." and encompasses everything from written calculation methods to algebraic manipulation and geometric construction techniques.

Key characteristics of procedural knowledge include:
- Step-by-step sequences that can be applied systematically
- Methods that apply to specific categories of problems
- Algorithms that can be performed with varying degrees of fluency
- Procedures that build upon declarative knowledge

The review highlights the importance of teaching procedures with understanding rather than as mechanical processes. When pupils understand why procedures work, they can adapt them to novel situations and recognise when particular methods are appropriate.

#### Conditional Knowledge

Conditional knowledge comprises strategies formed from combining facts and methods to reason and problem-solve. This knowledge can be prefaced with "I know when..." and represents the highest level of mathematical competence, enabling pupils to select appropriate approaches for unfamiliar problems.

Conditional knowledge involves:
- Recognising problem types and selecting suitable strategies
- Adapting known methods to novel situations
- Reasoning mathematically about unfamiliar problems
- Making decisions about which mathematical tools to deploy

The research review notes that conditional knowledge develops over time as pupils gain experience applying declarative and procedural knowledge in varied contexts. Problem-solving strategies are best taught explicitly once pupils can recall and deploy facts and methods with speed and accuracy.

### Curriculum Design Principles

The 2021 research review outlines several principles for curriculum design that have subsequently influenced inspection practice and school policy.

#### Systematic Sequencing

Curriculum content should be sequenced systematically, with new learning building securely on prior knowledge. This requires careful consideration of prerequisite knowledge for each topic and the identification of component skills that compose more complex capabilities.

The review emphasises that curriculum sequencing should not simply follow textbook order or historical convention. Instead, leaders should make deliberate decisions about the order in which concepts are introduced, ensuring that pupils have mastered foundational content before encountering dependent ideas.

#### Foundational Emphasis

Particularly in early years and Key Stage 1, the curriculum should prioritise core facts and concepts that form the building blocks for later learning. This systematic approach to teaching number, shape, and basic mathematical relationships helps close entry gaps in knowledge.

The review cites evidence that disadvantaged pupils can match or exceed the attainment of more advantaged peers when taught using systematic approaches that ensure mastery of foundational content. Rather than relying on derivation or guessing, pupils should develop automatic recall of key concepts.

#### Managing Cognitive Load

Effective curriculum design manages pupils' cognitive load by carefully sequencing content and providing appropriate scaffolding. The review draws on cognitive science research to argue that working memory limitations mean pupils can only process limited new information simultaneously.

When foundational knowledge is secure and automatically retrievable, pupils' working memory is freed to focus on new learning. This principle supports the emphasis on fluency and automatic recall in early curriculum phases.

### Pedagogical Recommendations

The research review makes specific recommendations about teaching approaches that support effective mathematics learning.

#### Explicit Instruction and Modelling

Teachers should provide explicit instruction and clear modelling of mathematical procedures. This includes demonstrating thought processes, explaining why particular approaches are chosen, and making mathematical reasoning visible to pupils.

The review acknowledges that inquiry-based approaches have their place but argues that explicit instruction is particularly important when introducing new concepts or procedures. Once pupils have secure understanding, they benefit from opportunities to apply knowledge independently.

#### Deliberate Practice and Interleaving

Regular practice is essential for developing fluency and automaticity. The review recommends deliberate practice—focused rehearsal of specific skills with attention to accuracy and efficiency—and interleaving—mixing different types of problems to encourage discrimination between problem types.

Practice should be purposeful and progressively challenging. Over-reliance on repetitive exercises involving only slight variation may limit pupils' ability to apply learning in novel contexts.

#### Formative Assessment

Ongoing formative assessment enables teachers to identify and address gaps in understanding promptly. The review emphasises the importance of checking understanding throughout lessons and adjusting teaching in response to pupil needs.

Teachers should distinguish between infrequent errors that represent opportunities for learning and consistent mistakes that indicate gaps in foundational knowledge requiring systematic attention.

## Coordinating Mathematical Success: The Subject Report (2023)

### Evidence Base and Methodology

Published in July 2023, **Coordinating Mathematical Success: The Mathematics Subject Report** evaluates common strengths and weaknesses identified during inspections of 50 schools between September 2021 and November 2022. The report draws on evidence gathered by His Majesty's Inspectors during routine inspections, supplemented by analysis of examination data, national reference test results, and wider research.

The report is structured around findings from primary schools and secondary schools, with additional evidence from Reception classes and sixth forms. Within each section, Ofsted examines curriculum, pedagogy, assessment, school organisation, and the impact on pupil learning.

### Key Findings: Primary Schools

The 2023 report identifies significant positive developments in primary mathematics education, describing a "resounding, positive shift" in recent years.

#### Curriculum-Centred Leadership

Mathematics is now at the heart of leaders' decisions and actions in most primary schools examined. Generic approaches—such as the expectation that all teaching should always be differentiated—have dissipated in favour of high-quality curriculums and collaborative support for teachers.

Leaders increasingly intend that pupils "keep up, not catch up," providing early intervention and additional practice rather than allowing gaps to widen. This represents a fundamental shift from reactive remediation to proactive prevention of learning difficulties.

#### Improved Teacher Explanations

Teachers are increasingly successful in helping pupils understand new concepts, supported by training from Maths Hubs and other professional development providers. The report notes widespread use of:

- Physical resources and pictorial representations to reveal underlying mathematical structures
- Explicit teaching and modelling of new vocabulary
- Regular checking of understanding and swift identification of misconceptions
- Collaborative planning and shared approaches across year groups

These practices reflect the influence of teaching for mastery approaches promoted through the NCETM and Maths Hubs since 2016.

#### Deficiencies in Practice

Despite improvements in teaching quality, the report identifies deficiencies in the quality and quantity of practice that pupils undertake. Even when teaching is clear and precise, insufficient or poorly designed practice may undermine pupils' ability to remember important knowledge.

For older primary pupils, these deficiencies affect their ability to attain procedural fluency—combining speed and accuracy in mathematical calculations. The report suggests that practice activities are not always carefully designed to promote the depth of learning required.

#### Early Gaps in Knowledge

Pupils' gaps in knowledge tend to centre around addition facts in younger year groups. These gaps may not become apparent immediately because pupils can understand what is being taught and keep up with extra support and slower calculation. However, this masks developing difficulties that later limit access to the curriculum.

The report emphasises the importance of identifying and addressing these early gaps systematically, ensuring all pupils develop the automatic recall of number facts necessary for later success.

#### Year 6 Resource Allocation

Accountability measures and wide spreads of attainment influence leaders' decisions about resource allocation, with many schools directing additional support to Year 6 cohorts. This leaves fewer resources to invest in pupils' earlier education, potentially allowing gaps to develop that require later intervention.

The report notes that a goal of true proficiency is sometimes superseded by 'age-related expectations,' which roughly equates to 50% accuracy in end-of-key-stage tests. As a result, many pupils are not as prepared for secondary education as they could be.

### Key Findings: Secondary Schools

The secondary findings reveal notable improvements alongside persistent weaknesses that continue to limit mathematics learning.

#### Persistent Weaknesses

Despite improvements since the "Made to Measure" report, certain weaknesses persist across many secondary schools:

**Teaching disparate skills for examination success:** Some schools teach narrow sets of skills to enable pupils to pass examinations without equipping them with the mathematical knowledge needed for subsequent education, work, and life. This approach produces acceptable examination outcomes while leaving significant gaps in understanding.

**Weaknesses in problem-solving instruction:** Mathematical problem-solving remains an area of weakness across many schools. Curriculum decisions about problem-solving are often left to individual class teachers, resulting in variable quality and insufficient attention to developing conditional knowledge.

These weaknesses are disproportionately likely in schools that struggle to recruit and retain specialist mathematics teachers.

#### Curriculum Planning Strengths and Weaknesses

Curriculum planning around teaching mathematical facts and methods is usually strong. However, where planning is weaker, it tends to take less account of what pupils have learned previously and what they will study later. In these schools, pupils are taught series of disconnected methods and 'tricks' that apply only in specific circumstances.

Long-term curriculum planning to develop problem-solving abilities is uncommon. The report emphasises that problem-solving cannot be taught effectively without secure declarative and procedural knowledge, but also notes that such knowledge alone does not guarantee problem-solving capability.

#### Teacher Quality and Recruitment Challenges

Recruiting and retaining high-quality, specialist mathematics teachers remains a significant challenge. Leaders' curriculum decisions are increasingly influenced by staffing difficulties, with some schools providing weaker mathematics education because they do not take steps to develop the subject knowledge and subject-specific pedagogical knowledge of less experienced or non-specialist teachers.

Where schools employ non-specialist teachers, the quality of provision is variable. The report emphasises that non-specialist teachers can be supported to deliver effective mathematics education through appropriate CPD and collaborative working arrangements.

#### Assessment and Grade Thresholds

Leaders' application of GCSE grade thresholds to internal assessments sometimes gives false assurance about pupils' learning. Because GCSE grade boundaries are set to achieve particular outcome distributions, pupils can achieve 'passing' grades with significant gaps in knowledge.

When teachers and leaders accept these levels of achievement in internal assessments, some pupils progress through the curriculum with growing gaps of knowledge. This undermines their preparation for post-16 study and limits their mathematical development.

#### Sixth Form Provision

The report notes positive developments in sixth form mathematics, with mathematics and further mathematics among the most popular A Level subjects. Within the top 15 subjects chosen by students, mathematics and further mathematics have the highest proportion of A* and A grades awarded.

Core Mathematics—a Level 3 course taken alongside A Levels or equivalent qualifications—is identified as an increasingly popular option that extends mathematical education for students who might otherwise discontinue the subject.

## Coordinating Mathematical Success: The Concept

### Definition and Application

The phrase "coordinating mathematical success" describes how effective schools ensure that curriculum plans, teaching approaches, pupil tasks, assessments, and mechanisms for improvement align harmoniously. The report uses this concept to synthesise findings about effective practice across different school contexts.

When coordination is successful:
- Each individual element is of high quality
- Elements work together to support pupil learning
- Schools set out clear paths to proficiency
- Progress is checked regularly
- Support is provided to help pupils stay on track

### The Components of Coordination

#### Curriculum Alignment

Effective curriculum planning ensures that teaching sequences, resources, and assessment all support the same learning objectives. Leaders make deliberate decisions about content sequencing, identifying the component knowledge that pupils need before they can access more complex ideas.

Curriculum alignment also involves ensuring that teaching across different classes and year groups follows coherent approaches. This does not require identical lessons but does require consistent progression and shared understanding of how concepts develop.

#### Pedagogical Consistency

Whilst individual teachers will have different styles, effective schools develop shared pedagogical approaches that reflect evidence about effective mathematics teaching. This includes consistent approaches to:

- Using representations and manipulatives
- Developing mathematical vocabulary
- Checking for understanding
- Managing pupil practice
- Addressing misconceptions

#### Assessment Integration

Assessment is integrated into curriculum planning rather than treated as a separate activity. Formative assessment informs day-to-day teaching decisions, whilst summative assessment provides information about curriculum effectiveness and identifies areas requiring attention.

Effective assessment systems distinguish between performance on particular tasks and underlying learning. They avoid creating false confidence through grade thresholds that do not reflect secure knowledge.

#### Professional Development

Coordinating mathematical success requires ongoing professional development that develops teachers' subject knowledge and pedagogical expertise. The report notes that department meeting time is increasingly allocated to improving provision rather than administrative tasks—a significant positive change in recent years.

Professional development is most effective when it is subject-specific, sustained over time, and connected to teachers' classroom practice. Support from Maths Hubs and the NCETM provides valuable external expertise and peer networks.

## Implications for School Leaders

### Strategic Priorities

The Ofsted reports establish clear priorities for school leaders responsible for mathematics education:

1. **Curriculum quality:** Ensuring the mathematics curriculum is ambitious, coherent, and sequenced to build knowledge systematically

2. **Teaching quality:** Providing teachers with the subject knowledge, pedagogical expertise, and resources needed to teach effectively

3. **Assessment quality:** Developing assessment systems that provide accurate information about learning and inform improvement

4. **Professional development:** Investing in sustained, subject-specific CPD that develops teaching expertise

5. **Systems and culture:** Creating organisational structures and cultures that support continuous improvement

### Addressing the Attainment Gap

Both reports emphasise the importance of closing the gap between disadvantaged and advantaged pupils. Mathematics is identified as a particular area of concern, with disadvantaged English pupils much less likely to achieve Grade 4 at GCSE.

Effective approaches include:
- Systematic teaching of foundational content in early years
- Early identification and intervention for pupils falling behind
- High expectations for all pupils regardless of background
- Careful sequencing that ensures secure understanding before progression

### Supporting Non-Specialist Teachers

Schools that employ non-specialist mathematics teachers should provide structured support to develop subject knowledge and pedagogical expertise. This includes:
- Collaborative planning with specialist colleagues
- Access to high-quality curriculum resources
- Subject-specific professional development
- Clear guidance on teaching approaches
- Mentoring and coaching arrangements

### Inspection Preparation

Schools preparing for Ofsted inspections should ensure that their mathematics provision reflects the principles outlined in the research review and subject report. Inspectors will evaluate curriculum quality, teaching effectiveness, and the impact on pupil learning using the conceptual frameworks established in these publications.

Key preparation areas include:
- Documenting curriculum sequencing and rationale
- Ensuring assessment provides accurate information about learning
- Demonstrating how professional development improves teaching
- Showing how the curriculum meets the needs of all pupils
- Evidence of impact on pupil outcomes over time

## Critical Perspectives and Professional Debates

### Response from Subject Associations

The Ofsted mathematics reports have generated significant discussion within the mathematics education community. The Mathematical Association (MA) and Association of Teachers of Mathematics (ATM) produced a joint response to the research review, broadly welcoming its emphasis on high-quality curriculum whilst raising questions about particular recommendations.

Key areas of professional debate include:

**Problem-solving and discovery learning:** The research review's emphasis on explicit instruction has been interpreted by some as downplaying the value of inquiry-based approaches. Critics argue that mathematical discovery and exploration develop important reasoning skills and engagement.

**Assessment and accountability:** Some educators express concern that the focus on examination performance distorts curriculum priorities, encouraging teaching to the test rather than deep mathematical understanding.

**Differentiation versus mastery:** The shift away from differentiated teaching towards whole-class instruction represents a significant change in practice that some teachers find challenging to implement effectively.

**Practical constraints:** Schools face practical constraints—staffing difficulties, resource limitations, time pressures—that can make implementing Ofsted's recommendations challenging in practice.

### Balancing Perspectives

It is important to recognise that Ofsted's reports represent one perspective on effective mathematics education, albeit an influential one shaped by research evidence. Schools should engage critically with the recommendations, adapting them to their specific contexts whilst maintaining focus on pupil learning outcomes.

The reports themselves acknowledge that there is no single correct approach to teaching mathematics. What matters is that curriculum decisions are deliberate, informed by evidence, and evaluated against their impact on pupil learning.

## Connections to Wider Education Policy

### The Education Inspection Framework

The mathematics reports sit within Ofsted's broader **Education Inspection Framework (EIF)**, which emphasises curriculum quality, teaching effectiveness, and pupil outcomes across all subjects. The three types of mathematical knowledge—declarative, procedural, and conditional—parallel the EIF's emphasis on knowledge-rich curricula and pedagogical expertise.

### National Curriculum Alignment

The Ofsted reports are designed to support implementation of the **National Curriculum for Mathematics** (2014), which established higher expectations for mathematical attainment and emphasised fluency, reasoning, and problem-solving. The reports provide guidance on how these curriculum aims can be realised in practice.

### Government Initiatives

Several government initiatives complement the Ofsted reports:

**Teaching for Mastery:** The NCETM and Maths Hubs promote teaching for mastery approaches that align closely with Ofsted's recommendations about curriculum sequencing, practice, and collaborative professional development.

**Maths Hubs:** The network of Maths Hubs provides infrastructure for the professional development and collaborative working that Ofsted identifies as essential for effective mathematics teaching.

**Multiply Programme:** Adult numeracy initiatives address the mathematics attainment gap by supporting adults to improve their mathematical skills.

### Accountability Measures

Ofsted's reports engage critically with the impact of accountability measures on mathematics education. The tension between achieving threshold grades and securing deep understanding is a recurring theme, with the reports arguing for approaches that serve pupils' long-term mathematical development alongside meeting immediate accountability requirements.

## Future Directions

### Emerging Priorities

As mathematics education continues to evolve, several priorities emerge from the Ofsted reports:

**Addressing persistent gaps:** Despite overall improvements, gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged pupils, and between higher and lower attainers, remain significant challenges requiring sustained attention.

**Developing problem-solving:** Conditional knowledge and problem-solving capability remain areas of weakness requiring innovative approaches to curriculum design and pedagogy.

**Supporting the workforce:** The recruitment and retention of specialist mathematics teachers, and the development of non-specialist teachers, require ongoing investment and system-level solutions.

**Post-pandemic recovery:** The long-term effects of pandemic disruption on mathematical learning are still emerging, requiring responsive approaches to identifying and addressing gaps.

### Research Questions

The Ofsted reports identify areas where further research would be valuable:

- Effective approaches to developing conditional knowledge and problem-solving capability
- Strategies for supporting non-specialist teachers to deliver high-quality mathematics education
- Methods for closing attainment gaps between disadvantaged and advantaged pupils
- The relationship between curriculum design and long-term mathematical development

### Continued Evolution

The 2023 subject report notes that the positive picture of mathematics education did not arise by chance but through the commitment of school leaders, teachers, and the mathematics subject community. Sustaining and building upon these improvements will require continued collaboration, professional development, and evidence-informed practice.

## Summary and Conclusions

Ofsted's **Research Review Series: Mathematics** (2021) and **Coordinating Mathematical Success** (2023) represent significant contributions to understanding effective mathematics education in England. The reports establish clear frameworks for curriculum design, pedagogy, and school organisation based on research evidence and inspection findings.

Key contributions include:

- The categorisation of mathematical knowledge into declarative, procedural, and conditional types, providing a framework for curriculum planning and assessment
- Evidence of significant improvements in mathematics education, particularly in primary schools and curriculum design
- Identification of persistent weaknesses, particularly in problem-solving instruction and support for lower-attaining pupils
- The concept of "coordinating mathematical success" as a way of understanding how effective schools align curriculum, teaching, assessment, and professional development
- Practical guidance for school leaders on priorities for improvement

The reports emphasise that high-quality mathematics education requires deliberate coordination of multiple elements: well-sequenced curricula that build knowledge systematically, teaching approaches that develop understanding alongside fluency, assessment systems that provide accurate information about learning, and professional development that builds subject expertise.

Whilst acknowledging significant improvements since the 2012 "Made to Measure" report, Ofsted identifies ongoing challenges including the attainment gap between disadvantaged and advantaged pupils, weaknesses in problem-solving instruction, and the recruitment and retention of specialist teachers.

Schools engaging with these reports should recognise that they represent evidence-informed guidance rather than rigid prescriptions. Effective implementation requires adaptation to specific school contexts, critical engagement with recommendations, and sustained focus on the ultimate goal: enabling all pupils to develop the mathematical knowledge, skills, and confidence they need for future education, employment, and life.
