# ATM (Association of Teachers of Mathematics)

The Association of Teachers of Mathematics (ATM) is the leading subject association for mathematics education in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1950 by Caleb Gattegno, ATM has played a pivotal role in shaping mathematics pedagogy, curriculum development, and professional practice for over seven decades. As a registered charity with approximately 3,500 members, the organisation represents a diverse community of educators spanning early years, primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors.

## History and Founding

### The Caleb Gattegno Legacy

ATM was established in 1950 by Caleb Gattegno (1911-1988), a mathematician, psychologist, and educational innovator of Egyptian origin. Gattegno founded the organisation with a clear vision: to encourage the development of mathematics education to be more closely related to the needs of the learner. This learner-centred philosophy would become the cornerstone of ATM's approach and distinguish it from more traditional mathematical associations.

Gattegno's influence extended far beyond mathematics education. He was a polymath who made significant contributions to language teaching (developing the Silent Way method), reading instruction (Words in Colour), and educational psychology. His work as an early English translator of Jean Piaget's writings on child development informed ATM's foundational understanding of how children learn mathematics. Gattegno also collaborated closely with Georges Cuisenaire in developing and promoting the use of Cuisenaire rods, which became iconic manipulative tools for teaching mathematical concepts.

### Organisational Development

From its inception, ATM adopted a distinctive organisational culture that reflected Gattegno's educational philosophy. The association positioned itself as a cooperative community rather than a hierarchical body, encouraging questioning approaches and giving due attention to the ideas of all members. This collaborative ethos has persisted throughout the organisation's history.

ATM is headquartered at 2a Vernon Street, Vernon House, Derby DE1 1FR, operating from a central location that facilitates its nationwide activities. The organisation maintains a governance structure centred on the ATM General Council, with a Senior Administrative Officer (currently Sam Walters) overseeing operational matters.

## Aims and Guiding Principles

### Core Aims

The Association of Teachers of Mathematics articulates four primary aims that guide its work:

1. **Encouraging increased understanding and enjoyment of mathematics** — ATM seeks to foster positive attitudes towards mathematics, recognising that affective factors significantly influence learning outcomes.

2. **Encouraging increased understanding of how people learn mathematics** — The association promotes research-informed practice, drawing on cognitive science, developmental psychology, and classroom-based inquiry.

3. **Encouraging the sharing and evaluation of teaching and learning strategies and practices** — ATM facilitates professional dialogue and peer learning, recognising that effective practice develops through collaborative reflection.

4. **Promoting the exploration of new ideas and possibilities** — The organisation encourages innovation and creative approaches to mathematics education, resisting rigid orthodoxies.

### The Four Guiding Principles

ATM's pedagogical approach is shaped by four guiding principles that reflect its distinctive philosophy:

**The Universality of Mathematical Functioning**

"The ability to operate mathematically is an aspect of human functioning which is as universal as language itself. Attention needs constantly to be drawn to this fact. Any possibility of intimidating with mathematical expertise is to be avoided."

This principle asserts that all learners possess innate mathematical capabilities and that education should build upon these natural endowments rather than treating mathematics as an elite domain accessible only to the gifted few.

**Learner-Centred Pedagogy**

"The power to learn rests with the learner. Teaching has a subordinate role. The teacher has a duty to seek out ways to engage the power of the learner."

This radical statement positions the learner as the active agent in education, with the teacher's role being to create conditions that unleash the learner's inherent capacity for mathematical thinking.

**Critical Examination and Innovation**

"It is important to examine critically approaches to teaching and to explore new possibilities, whether deriving from research, from technological developments or from the imaginative and insightful ideas of others."

ATM encourages a questioning stance towards established practices and maintains openness to innovation from diverse sources.

**Cooperative Professionalism**

"Teaching and learning are cooperative activities. Encouraging a questioning approach and giving due attention to the ideas of others are attitudes to be encouraged. Influence is best sought by building networks of contacts in professional circles."

This principle emphasises the social nature of professional development and the importance of building collaborative networks among educators.

## The Mathematics Teaching Journal

The organisation's publications are read by educators worldwide, and ATM members regularly participate in international conferences such as those of the International Group for the Psychology of Mathematics Education (PME).

## Pedagogical Legacy and Contemporary Relevance

### Enduring Principles

The pedagogical principles articulated by Caleb Gattegno and refined by generations of ATM members remain highly relevant to contemporary mathematics education. The emphasis on:

- Starting from learners' existing understandings
- Using manipulatives and visual representations
- Encouraging mathematical talk and reasoning
- Prioritising conceptual understanding over procedural fluency
- Creating opportunities for mathematical exploration

These principles align closely with current evidence-informed approaches to mathematics teaching, including mastery approaches, concrete-pictorial-abstract (CPA) methodologies, and dialogic teaching.

### Cuisenaire Rods and Manipulatives

Gattegno's work with Cuisenaire rods, promoted through ATM from the organisation's earliest days, has experienced renewed interest in recent years. The current emphasis on manipulatives in primary mathematics, reflected in teaching for mastery programmes, can be traced in part to ATM's long-standing advocacy for hands-on mathematical learning.

### The Subordination of Teaching to Learning

Perhaps ATM's most distinctive contribution to pedagogical thought is the radical proposition that "the power to learn rests with the learner" and that "teaching has a subordinate role." This formulation challenges educators to focus relentlessly on the learner's experience and to resist the temptation to prioritise teaching activity over learning outcomes.

In an era of performativity, accountability, and prescribed curricula, this learner-centred principle offers a valuable corrective, reminding educators that the ultimate measure of educational success is the learner's development, not the teacher's performance.

## Critical Perspectives and Debates

### The Non-Refereed Journal Model

ATM's decision to publish *Mathematics Teaching* without academic peer review has been both a strength and a limitation. While the approach democratises access to publication and values practitioner voice, it means that the journal does not carry the academic prestige of refereed journals. Some critics have suggested that this limits ATM's influence in research-intensive contexts.

Advocates counter that the non-refereed model embodies ATM's commitment to accessibility and that the journal's value lies in its practical relevance rather than academic credentials.

### Maintaining Relevance in a Changing Landscape

Like all professional associations, ATM has faced challenges in maintaining relevance in an era of:

- Social media and informal professional networks
- Free online resources and open educational resources
- Increasing time pressures on teachers
- Competing demands for professional development funding

The AMiE merger can be understood as a strategic response to these challenges, seeking to create a more resilient and resourceful organisation capable of serving mathematics educators in the contemporary context.

### Balancing Primary and Secondary Interests

With a membership weighted towards primary teachers, ATM has sometimes struggled to maintain equal relevance across all phases. Secondary teachers occasionally report that resources and publications feel more oriented towards primary contexts. The organisation has worked to address this through targeted publications and conference strands, but the challenge of serving diverse phases remains.
