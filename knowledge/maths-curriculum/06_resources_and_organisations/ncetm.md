# NCETM: National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics

## Overview and Mission

The National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics (NCETM) is the Department for Education's (DfE) flagship organisation for improving mathematics education in England. Established in 2006 following the recommendations of the Smith Report (2004), the NCETM exists to raise levels of achievement in mathematics and to increase appreciation of the subject's power and importance amongst pupils and the wider public.

The NCETM's core mission is to support the ongoing professional development of all those who teach mathematics, from Early Years practitioners to post-16 educators. It achieves this primarily through the coordination of the Maths Hubs Programme, with teaching for mastery serving as the underpinning pedagogical principle. The organisation is funded by the Department for Education and led and delivered by Etio (formerly Empowering Education International Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tribal Group plc), with MEI (Mathematics in Education and Industry) serving as a key partner.

## Historical Context: The Smith Report and Establishment

### The 2004 Smith Report

The NCETM's creation was directly prompted by Professor Adrian Smith's seminal report, "Making Mathematics Count," published in 2004. This comprehensive review of 14-19 mathematics education in England identified significant weaknesses in the continuing professional development (CPD) available to mathematics teachers. Smith argued that the fragmented nature of mathematics CPD, the lack of coordination between providers, and the absence of any central body to maintain an overview of professional development opportunities were serious barriers to improving mathematics teaching.

The report highlighted that mathematics teachers often struggled to access high-quality, subject-specific professional development that would enable them to develop deep subject knowledge and effective pedagogical approaches. This finding was particularly concerning given the persistent challenges England faced in recruiting and retaining sufficiently qualified mathematics teachers.

### Establishment in 2006

In response to the Smith Report's recommendations, the government issued a tender for a new national centre to coordinate and improve mathematics CPD. The contract was awarded to Tribal Group, and the NCETM was formally established in 2006. The organisation's initial focus was on creating a portal that would serve as a central hub for mathematics teachers to access resources, professional development opportunities, and a community of practice.

The NCETM's remit has evolved considerably since its establishment. While its early work focused primarily on signposting and resource provision, the organisation has increasingly taken on a more active role in shaping the direction of mathematics education policy and practice, particularly through the development and promotion of teaching for mastery approaches.

## The Maths Hubs Programme

### Origins and Structure

The Maths Hubs Programme represents the NCETM's most significant intervention in the English mathematics education landscape. Launched in 2014, the programme established a national network of 40 Maths Hubs, each led by an outstanding school or college with a strong track record in mathematics education. These hubs serve as regional centres of excellence, working with schools and colleges to improve mathematics teaching and attainment.

Each Maths Hub is responsible for delivering the NCETM's national professional development programmes to teachers in their region, as well as developing locally-tailored support. The hubs operate on a collaborative model, bringing together mathematics teachers, leaders, and specialists to share expertise and develop practice.

### National Coordination and Local Implementation

The NCETM coordinates the national programme while allowing hubs flexibility to respond to local needs. This balance between national consistency and local adaptation has been crucial to the programme's success. The NCETM provides the overarching framework, quality assurance, and central resources, whilst the hubs deliver the programmes and build relationships with schools in their areas.

The Maths Hubs work closely with other stakeholders, including the Advanced Mathematics Support Programme (AMSP), which manages post-16 mathematics support, and various subject associations. This collaborative approach ensures that schools receive coherent support that addresses their needs across all phases and contexts.

## Teaching for Mastery

### The Five Big Ideas

At the heart of the NCETM's work lies the concept of teaching for mastery, which draws on evidence from high-performing jurisdictions, particularly Shanghai and Singapore. The NCETM has articulated five interconnected principles—known as the Five Big Ideas—that underpin mastery approaches:

#### Coherence

Teaching is designed to enable a coherent learning progression through the curriculum, providing access for all pupils to develop a deep and connected understanding of mathematics that they can apply in a range of contexts. Coherence involves breaking down mathematical concepts into small, connected steps that build on each other systematically. This happens within lessons, across lessons, and across year groups, ensuring that pupils develop a cumulative understanding of mathematics.

#### Representation and Structure

Teachers carefully select and sequence representations to expose the underlying mathematical structure. Concrete and pictorial representations are used to make abstract concepts accessible, with the goal of helping pupils develop mental models that they can draw upon when working with abstract symbols. The careful sequencing of representations helps pupils see connections between different areas of mathematics and supports the development of deep conceptual understanding.

#### Mathematical Thinking

Pupils are encouraged to think mathematically, rather than simply following procedures. This involves looking for patterns, making conjectures, reasoning about relationships, and developing chains of reasoning. Mathematical thinking is central to coherence and variation, as pupils need to make sense of the mathematics they encounter. It supports fluency by helping pupils reason about known facts and derive new ones.

#### Fluency

Fluency involves efficient, accurate recall of key number facts and procedures, but it demands more than this. It requires pupils to have the flexibility to move between different contexts and representations of mathematics, to recognise relationships and make connections, and to choose appropriate methods and strategies to solve problems. Fluency develops through the movement between representations and the ability to see the structure of the mathematics.

#### Variation

Variation is twofold: conceptual variation and procedural variation. Conceptual variation involves presenting concepts in different ways to highlight what something is and what it is not, helping pupils develop a rich, multi-faceted understanding. Procedural variation involves carefully sequencing examples and exercises to draw attention to mathematical relationships and structures. The purpose of variation is to draw closer attention to a key feature of a mathematical concept or structure through varying some elements while keeping others constant.

### Primary Teaching for Mastery Programme

The NCETM and Maths Hubs have been running the national Primary Teaching for Mastery Programme since 2015. This programme supports primary schools to introduce and embed teaching for mastery approaches in their mathematics lessons. Schools participate in a sustained professional development programme, typically spanning several years, working with a Mastery Specialist from their local Maths Hub.

The programme has grown significantly since its inception. In the first year, 136 schools from across England participated. By the 2020s, thousands of schools had engaged with the programme, making it one of the largest and most sustained mathematics education interventions in English history.

### Secondary Teaching for Mastery Programme

Building on the success of the primary programme, the NCETM launched the Secondary Teaching for Mastery Programme in 2018. This two-year programme supports secondary mathematics teachers to become experts in teaching for mastery and lead change within their departments. Schools nominate teachers to become Mastery Advocates, who participate in professional development and then work to develop their departments as well-led, high-performing teams providing high-quality professional development through collaborative working.

## The Shanghai Teacher Exchange

### Origins and Implementation

The Mathematics Teacher Exchange (MTE) between England and Shanghai represents one of the most visible and influential components of the NCETM's teaching for mastery work. Initiated in 2014, the exchange programme involves teachers from English schools visiting Shanghai to observe teaching in partner schools, followed by Shanghai teachers visiting England to teach in English schools.

The exchange was established following England's participation in the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which showed Shanghai (representing China) performing at the top of the mathematics rankings. The DfE and NCETM sought to understand what practices in Shanghai mathematics education could be adapted for the English context.

### Programme Structure and Impact

In the exchange programme, English teachers spend two weeks in Shanghai, observing lessons, participating in teacher research groups (known as "lesson groups"), and working with Shanghai partner teachers. The following term, the Shanghai teachers visit England, teaching in the English teachers' schools and demonstrating mastery approaches to local teachers.

The exchange has had a profound impact on the NCETM's work. Several thousand teachers across England have been exposed to the Shanghai version of teaching for mastery through the exchange and associated programmes. The NCETM has documented how this exposure has influenced the development of teaching for mastery in England, particularly in areas such as lesson design, the use of representation, and the structure of mathematical explanations.

### Evaluation Findings

The MTE programme has been subject to rigorous evaluation by the DfE. Research has found that the exchange is associated with positive impacts on teachers' beliefs about mathematics teaching and their classroom practices. Participating teachers report increased confidence in using multiple representations, asking deeper questions, and designing lessons that build concepts progressively.

However, evaluations have also identified challenges. The transfer of practices from the Shanghai context—with its different curriculum structure, timetabling arrangements, and cultural expectations—to the English context requires significant adaptation. The structural and systemic changes needed for full implementation of Shanghai-style teaching are far-reaching, and schools have needed sustained support to make meaningful changes to their practice.

## Professional Development Programmes

### Mastery Specialist Programmes

The NCETM's Mastery Specialist Programmes are central to its strategy for developing capacity in the system. These programmes identify and train outstanding teachers to become experts in teaching for mastery, who then support other teachers in their schools and beyond.

The Primary Mastery Specialist Programme is a three-year programme. In the first year, specialists participate in residentials and develop their understanding of the Five Big Ideas in depth, focusing on the subject knowledge required to design lessons that unfold the mathematics for all children. In subsequent years, specialists lead Work Groups with other schools, supporting them to implement teaching for mastery approaches.

The Secondary Mastery Specialist Programme follows a similar structure over two years, supporting secondary mathematics teachers to become experts in teaching for mastery and lead change within their departments.

### Early Years and Post-16 Programmes

The NCETM has increasingly focused on extending teaching for mastery approaches beyond the core primary and secondary phases. Work Groups for Early Years practitioners support the development of mathematics teaching in Reception and nursery settings, recognising the importance of building strong foundations in the early years.

At the post-16 level, the NCETM works with the Advanced Mathematics Support Programme (AMSI) to support the teaching of Core Maths, A Level Mathematics, and A Level Further Mathematics. This includes professional development for teachers new to teaching post-16 mathematics, as well as support for developing effective pedagogical approaches for older students.

### Sustained Professional Development

A distinctive feature of the NCETM's approach is the emphasis on sustained professional development rather than one-off training events. The various Work Groups and programmes typically run over extended periods, allowing teachers to embed new approaches in their practice and reflect on their impact. This approach is grounded in research showing that effective professional development requires time, support, and opportunities for collaboration.

## Resources and Support for Teachers

### The NCETM Website and Portal

The NCETM website serves as a comprehensive resource for mathematics teachers, providing access to professional development materials, curriculum resources, case studies, and research. The site includes extensive materials on teaching for mastery, including exemplification of the Five Big Ideas, lesson videos, and planning guidance.

The website also hosts the Professional Development Directory, which signposts teachers to professional development opportunities in their regions. This addresses one of the original concerns raised in the Smith Report about the difficulty teachers faced in finding appropriate CPD.

### Curriculum Materials and Guidance

The NCETM has developed detailed curriculum materials to support the implementation of teaching for mastery. The Primary Mastery Professional Development Materials provide a comprehensive framework for developing subject knowledge across the primary curriculum, organised by mathematical topic and year group. These materials support teachers in understanding the progression of mathematical concepts and the representations that can be used to teach them effectively.

For secondary schools, the NCETM has developed materials addressing key areas of the KS3 curriculum, with a focus on building on primary foundations and preparing students for GCSE. The KS3 Curriculum Prioritisation materials, developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, provided guidance on the most important content to focus on when time was limited.

### Checkpoints and Diagnostic Materials

The NCETM has developed various diagnostic tools to help teachers assess pupils' understanding and identify areas where intervention may be needed. The Multiplication Tables Check guidance supports schools in preparing for the statutory Year 4 check, while the Secondary Checkpoints materials provide diagnostic questions for KS3 teachers to use to identify gaps in understanding and inform planning.

## Impact and Influence

### Scale of Engagement

The NCETM's programmes have reached a significant proportion of English schools. By the mid-2020s, over 8,000 primary schools had participated in the Primary Teaching for Mastery Programme, representing approximately half of all primary schools in England. The Secondary Teaching for Mastery Programme had engaged with hundreds of secondary schools, with many more accessing support through their local Maths Hub.

The Maths Hubs themselves work with thousands of schools each year through their various programmes and Work Groups. The NCETM website receives millions of page views annually, with teachers accessing resources, reading case studies, and using the professional development materials.

### Evidence of Impact

Research commissioned by the DfE has found evidence of positive impacts from the NCETM's teaching for mastery programmes. A longitudinal evaluation of the Mathematics Teacher Exchange found evidence of changing teacher practices and beliefs associated with participation in the programme. Schools participating in the Primary Teaching for Mastery Programme have reported improvements in pupil attainment and attitudes towards mathematics, though establishing causal attribution is complex given the multiple factors affecting pupil outcomes.

The NCETM's approach to professional development has been influential beyond mathematics education. The model of sustained, collaborative professional development delivered through a network of local hubs has informed thinking about teacher development across the education system.

### Policy Influence

The NCETM has become a significant voice in mathematics education policy. Its work on teaching for mastery has been endorsed by the DfE and Ofsted, with the 2021 Ofsted mathematics subject review drawing extensively on NCETM research and materials. The organisation's Director of Primary Mathematics, Debbie Morgan, has been a prominent advocate for teaching for mastery, contributing to national discussions about curriculum and pedagogy.

The NCETM's materials have influenced the development of other resources, including the DfE's non-statutory mathematics guidance published in 2020. This guidance, which provides exemplification of the national curriculum, was co-authored by NCETM staff and draws directly on the organisation's professional development materials.

## Challenges and Criticisms

### Implementation Challenges

While the NCETM's programmes have achieved significant reach, implementing teaching for mastery approaches has presented challenges for schools. The pedagogical changes required—moving from a focus on procedure to a focus on depth, changing the structure of lessons, and developing new approaches to differentiation—represent significant shifts in practice that require sustained support.

Schools have faced particular challenges in areas such as finding time for collaborative planning and professional development, managing the transition to mastery approaches across year groups when only some teachers have been trained, and addressing the needs of pupils with significant gaps in prior knowledge within a mastery approach.

### Debates About Mastery

The NCETM's promotion of teaching for mastery has not been without debate within the mathematics education community. Some commentators have questioned the extent to which practices from East Asian contexts can be successfully transferred to England, given differences in curriculum, assessment, and cultural expectations. Others have raised concerns about whether a single pedagogical approach is appropriate for all schools and pupils, or whether the NCETM's approach has become overly dominant in shaping policy and practice.

The NCETM has responded to these debates by emphasising the adaptation of mastery principles to the English context, rather than the direct importation of East Asian practices. The organisation has also been clear that teaching for mastery is not a single, rigid approach but a set of principles that can be implemented in various ways according to school context.

### Sustainability and Capacity

Questions of sustainability and capacity have arisen as the NCETM's programmes have scaled. Ensuring that the thousands of Mastery Specialists trained can continue to provide high-quality support within and beyond their schools, and that the Maths Hubs can maintain quality as they expand their reach, are ongoing challenges. The NCETM has sought to address these challenges through the development of advanced training programmes for specialists and quality assurance processes for hubs.

## Future Directions

The NCETM continues to evolve in response to the changing landscape of mathematics education. The organisation has increasingly focused on post-16 mathematics, supporting the DfE's ambition to increase participation in mathematics beyond GCSE. It has also developed new programmes to address specific challenges, such as supporting pupils with SEND in mathematics and developing effective approaches for mixed-age classes.

The NCETM's core commitment remains supporting the ongoing professional development of mathematics teachers to improve outcomes for all pupils. As new research emerges and the education system continues to change, the organisation's challenge will be to maintain its focus on evidence-informed practice while remaining responsive to the needs of teachers and schools across England.
