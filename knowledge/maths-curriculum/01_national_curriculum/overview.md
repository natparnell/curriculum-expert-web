# The National Curriculum for Mathematics: Statutory Framework Overview

## Introduction and Legal Basis

The National Curriculum for Mathematics in England is established under the **Education Act 2002**, which imposes a statutory duty on local authorities and the governing bodies of maintained schools to exercise their functions with a view to securing that the National Curriculum for England is implemented. This legal obligation applies to all **local-authority-maintained schools** in England, making the programmes of study for mathematics legally binding in these settings.

The current National Curriculum framework was introduced in **September 2014**, with mathematics programmes of study coming into force for all year groups from **September 2016**. This reform represented the most significant restructuring of the mathematics curriculum since the National Curriculum's original introduction under the Education Reform Act 1988. The 2014 curriculum introduced higher expectations at earlier ages, removed National Curriculum levels, and emphasised fluency, reasoning, and problem solving as interconnected aims.

The statutory framework consists of two essential documents that mathematics subject leaders and teachers must understand:
1. **The National Curriculum Framework for Key Stages 1 to 4** — establishing overarching principles, inclusion requirements, and the structure of the curriculum
2. **The Mathematics Programmes of Study** — detailing subject-specific content, attainment targets, and statutory requirements for each key stage

All schools maintained by the local authority must teach the mathematics programmes of study from the dates specified in statutory guidance. Academy schools and free schools are not legally required to follow the National Curriculum, though many choose to do so, particularly as a foundation for their own curricula. The Department for Education (DfE) notes that academies and free schools must teach a broad and balanced curriculum, and the National Curriculum for mathematics serves as a benchmark for this requirement.

## The Purpose of Mathematics in the National Curriculum

The **purpose of study** statement for mathematics establishes its fundamental importance to children's education and future life chances. According to the Department for Education (DfE, 2014):

> "Mathematics is a creative and highly inter-connected discipline that has been developed over centuries, providing the solution to some of history's most intriguing problems. It is essential to everyday life, critical to science, technology and engineering, and necessary for financial literacy and most forms of employment."

This statement positions mathematics not merely as a school subject but as:
- A **creative discipline** with its own aesthetic and intellectual heritage
- An **inter-connected field** where ideas link across topics and applications
- A **practical necessity** for functioning in modern society
- A **foundation for employment** across virtually all sectors
- A **gateway to other subjects** including science, technology, and engineering

The purpose statement emphasises that a high-quality mathematics education provides:
- A foundation for understanding the world
- The ability to reason mathematically
- An appreciation of the beauty and power of mathematics
- A sense of enjoyment and curiosity about the subject

### Mathematics as a Core Subject

Mathematics holds **core subject status** alongside English and science throughout all key stages. This designation reflects its fundamental importance and means that:
- Mathematics must be taught to all pupils of compulsory school age
- The subject receives substantial time allocation within the school timetable
- Assessment and accountability measures prioritise mathematics outcomes
- Teacher training and professional development emphasise mathematics pedagogy

The core status also means that mathematics features prominently in Ofsted inspections and school accountability measures, including Progress 8 calculations at GCSE level.

## The Three Core Aims of the National Curriculum for Mathematics

The National Curriculum specifies three interconnected aims that should underpin mathematics teaching at all key stages. These aims are not separate strands to be taught in isolation but represent dimensions of mathematical proficiency that should be developed together.

### Aim 1: Become Fluent in the Fundamentals of Mathematics

The first aim states that pupils should **"become fluent in the fundamentals of mathematics, including through varied and frequent practice with increasingly complex problems over time, so that pupils develop conceptual understanding and the ability to recall and apply knowledge rapidly and accurately."**

This aim encompasses several interconnected elements:

#### Conceptual Understanding
Fluency requires more than memorisation; pupils must understand **why** mathematical procedures work, not merely **how** to perform them. The National Curriculum emphasises that conceptual understanding should precede and accompany procedural fluency. For example:
- Understanding place value before learning formal written methods
- Grasping the relationship between multiplication and division before memorising facts
- Comprehending the structure of fractions before operating with them

#### Varied and Frequent Practice
The curriculum explicitly recommends **variation** in practice—exposing pupils to problems presented in different contexts and formats rather than endless repetition of identical questions. This approach:
- Prevents mechanical proceduralism
- Develops flexible thinking
- Prepares pupils for unfamiliar problems
- Builds connections between mathematical ideas

#### Rapid and Accurate Recall
Fluency involves automaticity with number facts and procedures, freeing working memory for more complex thinking. The National Curriculum specifies certain knowledge that should be recalled rapidly:
- Number bonds to 20 (by Year 2)
- Multiplication and division facts to 12 × 12 (by Year 4)
- Standard units of measurement
- Common fraction-decimal-percentage equivalences

### Aim 2: Reason Mathematically

The second aim states that pupils should **"reason mathematically by following a line of enquiry, conjecturing relationships and generalisations, and developing an argument, justification or proof using mathematical language."**

This aim elevates mathematics beyond calculation to the realm of **logical reasoning and proof**:

#### Following a Line of Enquiry
Pupils should learn to pursue mathematical questions systematically:
- Noticing patterns and wondering "why?"
- Testing conjectures with examples
- Deciding whether findings are always, sometimes, or never true
- Knowing when they have answered their original question

#### Conjecturing and Generalising
Mathematical reasoning involves making and testing predictions:
- Noticing that the sum of two odd numbers is always even
- Conjecturing about the relationship between the circumference and diameter of circles
- Generalising from specific examples to broader principles

#### Justification and Proof
As pupils progress, they should develop increasingly sophisticated forms of mathematical argument:
- **Primary**: Explaining reasoning in words ("I know this because...")
- **Lower secondary**: Using examples and counter-examples
- **Upper secondary**: Following chains of deductive reasoning
- **Post-16**: Understanding formal proof structures

The National Curriculum emphasises that **mathematical language** is essential to reasoning—pupils must learn to express their thinking precisely using appropriate vocabulary and notation.

### Aim 3: Solve Problems

The third aim states that pupils should **"solve problems by applying their mathematics to a variety of routine and non-routine problems with increasing sophistication, including breaking down problems into a series of simpler steps and persevering in seeking solutions."**

Problem solving represents the **application** of mathematical knowledge and skills:

#### Routine and Non-Routine Problems
The curriculum distinguishes between:
- **Routine problems**: Applying standard techniques in familiar contexts (e.g., calculating the cost of multiple items)
- **Non-routine problems**: Requires strategic thinking, multiple steps, or novel approaches (e.g., "How many different rectangles can be made with a perimeter of 24cm?")

Both types are essential—routine problems build fluency and confidence; non-routine problems develop strategic thinking and resilience.

#### Breaking Down Complex Problems
The curriculum explicitly teaches problem-solving as a process:
- Understanding what is being asked
- Identifying relevant information and operations
- Planning a strategy
- Executing and monitoring progress
- Reviewing and evaluating the solution

#### Perseverance and Resilience
The inclusion of **"persevering in seeking solutions"** as a statutory aim recognises that mathematical problem solving often involves struggle. Pupils should develop:
- Tolerance for uncertainty
- Willingness to try multiple approaches
- Capacity to learn from unsuccessful attempts
- Persistence when solutions are not immediately apparent

---

## Structure Across Key Stages

The National Curriculum organises mathematics education into distinct phases, each with specific programmes of study and end-of-stage expectations.

### Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS)

While not formally part of the National Curriculum, the **Early Years Foundation Stage** provides the crucial foundation for mathematical learning. The statutory framework was revised in **September 2021**.

#### Early Learning Goals (ELG) for Mathematics

The EYFS framework specifies two Early Learning Goals for mathematics:

**Number ELG:**
- Have a deep understanding of number to 10, including the composition of each number
- Subitise (recognise quantities without counting) up to 5
- Automatically recall (without reference to rhymes, counting or other aids) number bonds up to 5 (including subtraction facts) and some number bonds to 10, including double facts

**Numerical Patterns ELG:**
- Verbally count beyond 20, recognising the pattern of the counting system
- Compare quantities up to 10 in different contexts, recognising when one quantity is greater than, less than or the same as the other quantity
- Explore and represent patterns within numbers up to 10, including evens and odds, double facts and how quantities can be distributed equally

#### Development Matters

The non-statutory **Development Matters** guidance (2021) provides progression statements for mathematics across three age bands:
- **Birth to three**: Developing early mathematical awareness through play and exploration
- **3 and 4-year-olds**: Building number sense, pattern recognition, and spatial awareness
- **Children in Reception**: Securing understanding of numbers to 10 and beyond, exploring patterns and shapes

The emphasis on **"deep understanding"** and **"number composition"** in the revised EYFS reflects research on the importance of number sense as a predictor of later mathematical achievement.

### Key Stage 1 (Ages 5–7, Years 1–2)

Key Stage 1 represents a period of rapid development in mathematical understanding. The National Curriculum provides **year-by-year programmes of study** for Years 1 and 2, recognising the pace of development at this stage.

#### Ready-to-Progress Criteria (2020)

In **June 2020**, the DfE published non-statutory guidance identifying the most important conceptual knowledge and understanding that pupils need as they progress. Developed with the **NCETM**, this guidance specifies **ready-to-progress criteria** for each year group:

| Year | Ready-to-Progress Criteria Focus Areas |
|------|----------------------------------------|
| **Year 1** | Counting, number bonds within 10, place value to 10 |
| **Year 2** | Number bonds within 20, place value to 100, multiplication tables |
| **Year 3** | Place value to 1000, multiplication tables (3, 4, 8), column addition/subtraction |
| **Year 4** | Place value to 10,000, all tables to 12×12, multiplication/division facts |
| **Year 5** | Place value to 1,000,000, formal methods, fractions/decimals/percentages |
| **Year 6** | Place value to 10,000,000, order of operations, ratio and algebra foundations |

These criteria are designed to help schools prioritise curriculum content, particularly for pupils whose learning has been disrupted. The NCETM has produced extensive exemplification materials and professional development resources linked to these criteria.

#### Statutory Assessments

- **Year 4 Multiplication Tables Check**: Computer-based assessment of fluency in tables up to 12×12
- **Year 6 SATs**: Three mathematics papers—Paper 1 (arithmetic), Papers 2–3 (reasoning)

### Key Stage 3 (Ages 11–14, Years 7–9)

The Key Stage 3 programme of study for mathematics builds on Key Stage 2 and prepares pupils for GCSE. The curriculum emphasises **connections across mathematical ideas**.

#### Programme of Study Structure

**Number:**
- Working with integers, fractions, decimals, and percentages
- Powers and roots

#### Working Mathematically at Key Stage 3

The Key Stage 3 programme explicitly requires pupils to **"build on Key Stage 2 and connections across mathematical ideas to develop fluency, mathematical reasoning and competence in solving increasingly sophisticated problems."**

Pupils should also **apply their mathematical knowledge in science, geography, computing and other subjects**, emphasising mathematics as a cross-curricular tool.

### Key Stage 4 (Ages 14–16, Years 10–11)

At Key Stage 4, the National Curriculum for mathematics is delivered through **GCSE specifications**. The statutory programme of study sets minimum requirements that all awarding bodies must meet.

#### GCSE Subject Content

The statutory content is divided into six areas:

1. **Number**: Structure and calculation; fractions, decimals and percentages; measures and accuracy
2. **Algebra**: Notation, vocabulary and manipulation; graphs; solving equations and inequalities; sequences
3. **Ratio, Proportion and Rates of Change**: Scale factors; percentage change; direct and inverse proportion
4. **Geometry and Measures**: Properties and constructions; mensuration and calculation; vectors
5. **Probability**: Recording and analysing probability; the probability scale
6. **Statistics**: Interpreting and representing data; statistical measures

#### Assessment Objectives (AOs)

All GCSE mathematics specifications must assess against three assessment objectives:

| Assessment Objective | Description | Weighting (Foundation) | Weighting (Higher) |
|---------------------|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **AO1** | Use and apply standard techniques | 50% | 40% |
| **AO2** | Reason, interpret and communicate mathematically | 25% | 30% |
| **AO3** | Solve problems within mathematics and in other contexts | 25% | 30% |

The tiered structure (Foundation grades 1–5, Higher grades 4–9) allows for appropriate challenge while ensuring all pupils can achieve positive outcomes.

### Key Stage 5 / Post-16 (Ages 16–18)

While not part of the statutory National Curriculum, **A Level Mathematics** is subject to Ofqual criteria and represents the standard pathway for mathematical study post-16.

#### A Level Mathematics Structure

**Compulsory Content:**
- **Pure Mathematics** (minimum 2/3 of content): Proof; algebra and functions; coordinate geometry; sequences and series; trigonometry; exponentials and logarithms; differentiation; integration; numerical methods; vectors
- **Statistics** (minimum 1/6 of content): Statistical sampling; data presentation and interpretation; probability; statistical distributions; statistical hypothesis testing
- **Mechanics** (minimum 1/6 of content): Quantities and units in mechanics; kinematics; forces and Newton's laws; moments

#### A Level Further Mathematics

Further Mathematics provides additional depth and breadth:
- **Core Pure**: Complex numbers; matrices; further algebra and functions; further calculus; further vectors; polar coordinates; hyperbolic functions; differential equations
- **Optional pathways**: Additional pure, statistics, mechanics, or discrete mathematics

The structure allows students to specialise while maintaining a broad mathematical foundation.

## Attainment Targets and Assessment

### The Single Attainment Target

The National Curriculum specifies a single, overarching **attainment target** for mathematics:

> "By the end of each key stage, pupils are expected to know, apply and understand the matters, skills and processes specified in the relevant programme of study."

This represents a significant departure from the previous National Curriculum, which specified discrete level descriptors for each key stage. The 2014 reform abolished National Curriculum levels, leaving schools to develop their own assessment systems for tracking progress.

### Implications for Assessment Without Levels

The removal of National Curriculum levels has significant implications for school practice:

**School-Level Responsibility:**
- Schools must determine their own approaches to measuring progress toward end-of-key-stage expectations
- Assessment systems must be "suitably challenging" (Ofsted criterion)
- Schools have autonomy to design frameworks aligned with their curriculum

**Retained National Assessments:**
Despite the removal of levels, summative checkpoints remain:
- **Year 4**: Multiplication Tables Check (MTC)
- **Year 6**: Key Stage 2 SATs (reading, mathematics, grammar/punctuation/spelling)
- **Year 11**: GCSE Mathematics (and GCSE Mathematics Linked Pair where offered)

**Teacher Assessment:**
- Ongoing formative assessment remains essential
- End-of-key-stage teacher assessment against statutory criteria
- Professional judgement supported by assessment materials

### Assessment at Key Stage 2

The Key Stage 2 mathematics SATs assess against the programme of study:

**Paper 1: Arithmetic** (30 minutes)
- Context-free calculations
- Tests procedural fluency
- 40 marks

**Papers 2 and 3: Reasoning** (40 minutes each)
- Mathematical problems in contexts
- Tests reasoning and problem solving
- 35 marks each

The assessments are designed to sample the curriculum broadly rather than test every objective.

### Assessment at Key Stage 4

GCSE Mathematics assessment reflects the tiered structure:

**Foundation Tier** (grades 1–5):
- Three papers (one non-calculator, two calculator)
- 1 hour 30 minutes each
- Emphasis on AO1 (50% weighting)

**Higher Tier** (grades 4–9):
- Three papers (one non-calculator, two calculator)
- 1 hour 30 minutes each
- Greater emphasis on AO2 and AO3 (30% each)

## Common Misconceptions and Implementation Challenges

Research and inspection evidence reveal several common misconceptions in implementing the National Curriculum for mathematics.

### Misconception 1: "Fluency Means Speed and Memorisation"

The National Curriculum's definition of fluency includes **conceptual understanding, varied practice, and application**—not merely rapid recall. Schools that focus only on speed drills and rote memorisation miss the curriculum's emphasis on understanding why procedures work.

**Correct interpretation:**
- Teach conceptual understanding before procedural fluency
- Use variation in practice problems
- Connect facts and procedures to underlying mathematical structures

### Misconception 2: "The Three Aims Are Separate Strands"

The three aims (fluency, reasoning, problem solving) are **interconnected dimensions** of mathematical proficiency, not separate curriculum areas to be taught in isolation.

**Correct interpretation:**
- Develop all three aims simultaneously within each topic
- Use reasoning to develop fluency (e.g., "Why does this method work?")
- Apply fluency in problem-solving contexts
- Reason about problem-solving strategies

### Misconception 3: "Greater Depth Means Moving to the Next Year's Content"

The National Curriculum expects pupils to work at **greater depth within their year group's programme of study**, not to accelerate into subsequent years' content.

**Correct interpretation:**
- Greater depth involves complex problem solving, reasoning, and application within age-appropriate content
- Acceleration can lead to superficial understanding and gaps in foundational knowledge
- Depth before breadth is the recommended approach

### Misconception 4: "Non-Statutory Content Can Be Ignored"

While square brackets indicate non-statutory example content, this material provides important guidance on the **range and type** of content appropriate at each stage.

**Correct interpretation:**
- Non-statutory content illustrates the expected standard
- Schools should use professional judgement in selecting examples
- The examples help ensure appropriate challenge and breadth

### Misconception 5: "Assessment Without Levels Means No Formal Assessment"

The removal of National Curriculum levels does not mean abandoning formal assessment. Schools still need robust systems for tracking progress and identifying gaps.

**Correct interpretation:**
- Schools should develop their own assessment frameworks aligned with the curriculum
- Regular low-stakes testing can support retrieval practice and identify misconceptions
- End-of-key-stage assessments remain statutory

---

## Implementation and School Flexibility

The National Curriculum framework provides flexibility in implementation while maintaining statutory expectations.

### Flexibility Within Key Stages

Schools are required to teach the relevant programme of study **by the end of the key stage**. Within each key stage, schools have flexibility to:
- Introduce content earlier or later than set out in the programme of study
- Introduce key stage content during an earlier key stage if appropriate
- Set out their school curriculum for mathematics on a year-by-year basis

### Mixed-Age Classes

For schools with mixed-age classes, the National Curriculum provides guidance:
- Plan a sequence of topics across the year that ensures coverage of statutory content
- Ensure that by the end of each key stage, all pupils have covered the relevant programme of study
- Use flexible grouping rather than rigid year-group separation

### Pupils with Special Educational Needs

The National Curriculum inclusion statement applies to mathematics:
- Teachers should set high expectations for every pupil
- Appropriate assessment should identify gaps and inform teaching
- Pupils with SEN should work as close to age-related expectations as possible
- Where necessary, pupils may work on content from earlier key stages

### English as an Additional Language

For pupils learning EAL, the National Curriculum emphasises:
- Mathematical language should be explicitly taught
- Visual representations and concrete resources support understanding
- Partnership between mathematics and EAL specialists can accelerate progress

## Summary

The National Curriculum for Mathematics establishes a statutory framework for mathematics education in maintained schools in England. Its key features include:

1. **Three interconnected aims**: Fluency, reasoning, and problem solving developed together
2. **Higher expectations at earlier ages**: Content previously taught later is now expected earlier
3. **Assessment without levels**: Schools determine their own progress measures while end-of-key-stage assessments remain
4. **Ready-to-progress criteria**: Non-statutory guidance identifies crucial conceptual milestones
5. **Flexibility within structure**: Schools have autonomy in how they organise teaching within key stages

For subject leaders, understanding this statutory framework is essential for curriculum design, assessment systems, and ensuring compliance with legal requirements while maintaining high expectations for all pupils.
