# KS2 Mathematics Programme of Study

**Statutory content for Years 3-6 (National Curriculum 2014)**

The KS2 mathematics programme of study builds upon the foundations laid in KS1, extending pupils' understanding of number, developing fluency with formal written methods, and introducing more complex mathematical concepts including fractions, decimals, percentages, ratio, and early algebra.

---

## Overview and Aims

The principal focus of mathematics teaching in lower key stage 2 (Years 3 and 4) is to ensure that pupils become increasingly fluent with whole numbers and the four operations, including number facts and the concept of place value. Pupils should develop efficient written and mental methods and perform calculations accurately with increasingly large whole numbers.

In upper key stage 2 (Years 5 and 6), pupils extend their understanding of the number system and place value to include larger integers. They develop connections between multiplication and division with fractions, decimals, percentages, and ratio.
