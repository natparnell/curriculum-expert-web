# Key Stage 1 Mathematics: Statutory Requirements

## Introduction

The Key Stage 1 (KS1) mathematics programme of study applies to Years 1 and 2 in maintained schools in England. This foundational stage builds upon the early mathematical learning in the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), securing the core concepts and skills that underpin all later mathematical development. The KS1 mathematics curriculum is critical because these early years establish the number sense, fluency, and problem-solving approaches that determine pupils' success in mathematics throughout their education.

The National Curriculum for mathematics aims to ensure that all pupils become fluent in the fundamentals of mathematics, reason mathematically, and can solve problems. At Key Stage 1, the focus is on developing confidence and mental fluency with whole numbers, counting and place value. This involves working with numerals, words and the four operations, including with practical resources.

The programme of study is organised into distinct domains: Number (which includes Number and Place Value, Addition and Subtraction, Multiplication and Division, and Fractions) and Geometry (which includes Properties of Shapes and Position and Direction). Measurement is also a significant component, providing contexts for applying number skills.

This document provides a comprehensive account of the statutory requirements for Key Stage 1 mathematics, drawing upon the official National Curriculum documentation, guidance from the Department for Education, and insights from mathematics education research.

## Aims of the National Curriculum for Mathematics at KS1

The National Curriculum for mathematics aims to ensure that by the end of Key Stage 1, all pupils:

1. **Develop confidence and mental fluency with whole numbers, counting and place value**: Pupils work with numbers up to 100 (Year 2), developing secure understanding of our number system.

2. **Become fluent in the fundamentals of mathematics**: Through varied and frequent practice with increasingly complex problems over time, pupils develop conceptual understanding and the ability to recall and apply knowledge rapidly and accurately.

3. **Reason mathematically**: Pupils follow a line of enquiry, conjecturing relationships and generalisations, and developing an argument, justification or proof using mathematical language.

4. **Solve problems**: Pupils apply their mathematics to a variety of routine and non-routine problems with increasing sophistication, including breaking down problems into a series of simpler steps and persevering in seeking solutions.

These aims reflect the three pillars of the mathematics curriculum: fluency, reasoning, and problem-solving. At Key Stage 1, the balance is tilted towards fluency, ensuring that pupils have secure foundations before encountering more complex mathematics at Key Stage 2.

## Key Concepts and Progression

### Number and Place Value

Understanding our number system is the foundation of mathematics. At KS1, pupils develop:

**Counting**: From rote counting to counting with understanding, recognising patterns in the number system.

**Place value**: Understanding that the position of a digit determines its value (tens and ones), and that our number system is based on powers of ten.

**Number sense**: Developing a feel for numbers, understanding their relative size, and being able to estimate and compare.

**Representation**: Using objects, pictures, and symbols to represent numbers and quantities.

### Addition and Subtraction

The four operations begin with addition and subtraction:

**Conceptual understanding**: Understanding addition as combining and subtraction as taking away or finding the difference.

**Number bonds**: Knowing addition facts within 20 (Year 1) and using these to derive facts within 100 (Year 2).

**Mental methods**: Developing strategies for mental calculation, including partitioning, bridging through ten, and using known facts.

**Written methods**: Beginning to record calculations, initially as expanded recordings and progressing towards efficient written methods.

**Inverse operations**: Understanding the relationship between addition and subtraction and using this to check calculations.

### Multiplication and Division

Multiplication and division are introduced in KS1:

**Conceptual understanding**: Understanding multiplication as repeated addition and division as sharing or grouping.

**Arrays**: Using arrays to represent multiplication and to show the commutative property.

**Tables facts**: Learning the 2, 5, and 10 times tables (Year 2), providing foundation for all later multiplication work.

**Problem solving**: Applying multiplication and division to solve simple problems in context.

### Fractions

Fractions are introduced as parts of wholes:

**Unit fractions**: Understanding 1/2, 1/4, and 1/3 as equal parts of a whole.

**Non-unit fractions**: Recognising fractions such as 2/4, 3/4 as multiples of unit fractions.

**Equivalence**: Recognising that 2/4 is equivalent to 1/2.

**Fractions of quantities**: Finding simple fractions of numbers and quantities.

### Measurement

Measurement provides contexts for applying number skills:

**Comparison**: Comparing and ordering by length, mass, capacity, and time.

**Standard units**: Using standard units (metres, centimetres, kilograms, grams, litres, millilitres, hours, minutes) and appropriate instruments.

**Money**: Recognising coins and notes, combining amounts, and calculating change.

**Time**: Telling time on analogue clocks and understanding the relationships between units of time.

### Geometry

Pupils develop spatial awareness and understanding of shape:

**Shape recognition**: Naming and describing common 2-D and 3-D shapes.

**Properties**: Identifying and describing properties such as sides, vertices, edges, and faces.

**Symmetry**: Recognising line symmetry in simple shapes.

**Position and direction**: Describing position, movement, and turns using appropriate vocabulary.

### Statistics

Year 2 pupils begin to work with data:

**Data collection**: Gathering and organising data using tally charts and simple tables.

**Representation**: Creating and interpreting pictograms and block diagrams.

**Interpretation**: Asking and answering questions about data, including totalling and comparing categories.

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA)

The CPA approach is fundamental to teaching mathematics at KS1:

**Concrete**: Pupils use physical objects (counters, cubes, Numicon, Cuisenaire rods) to represent mathematical concepts.

**Pictorial**: Pupils draw pictures or diagrams to represent the mathematics.

**Abstract**: Pupils use numerals, symbols, and formal methods.

All three stages are important. Moving too quickly to abstract representations before pupils have secure conceptual understanding leads to fragile learning.

### Fluency Through Practice

Fluency develops through:

**Varied practice**: Practising the same skill in different contexts and with different representations.

**Frequent short sessions**: Regular practice sessions are more effective than infrequent longer ones.

**Making connections**: Helping pupils see connections between facts (e.g. if I know 5 + 5 = 10, I can work out 5 + 6).

**Games and activities**: Engaging ways to practise that maintain motivation.

### Reasoning and Problem-Solving

Reasoning and problem-solving are developed through:

**Open-ended questions**: Questions with multiple possible answers or approaches.

**Always, sometimes, never**: Classifying statements as always, sometimes, or never true.

**Odd one out**: Identifying which item does not belong and explaining why.

**Real-world problems**: Applying mathematics to authentic contexts.

**Explaining and justifying**: Encouraging pupils to explain their thinking and justify their answers.

### Mathematical Talk

Talk is essential for developing mathematical understanding:

**Sentence stems**: Providing structures for pupils to articulate their thinking (e.g. "I know this because...", "This is similar to...").

**Maths vocabulary**: Explicitly teaching mathematical vocabulary and expecting pupils to use it.

**Discussion**: Creating opportunities for pupils to discuss their mathematical thinking with partners and the class.

## Assessment at Key Stage 1

### Teacher Assessment

At the end of Key Stage 1, teachers assess pupils against teacher assessment frameworks for mathematics. These frameworks describe performance at the "expected standard".

For 2023-24 onwards, these assessments are used for internal purposes only, not for statutory reporting. However, schools may still use the frameworks to ensure consistency in assessment.

### Interim Standards (for reference)

The interim standards describe what pupils should be able to do to meet the expected standard:

- Work confidently with numbers up to 100
- Add and subtract two-digit numbers using efficient methods
- Recall multiplication and division facts for the 2, 5 and 10 tables
- Recognise and use fractions
- Use standard units of measurement accurately
- Describe properties of shapes
- Interpret simple data

### Multiplication Tables Check (MTC)

The Multiplication Tables Check is administered to Year 4 pupils, so it falls outside Key Stage 1. However, the foundations for multiplication tables fluency are laid in Year 2, when pupils learn the 2, 5, and 10 times tables.

## Common Challenges

### Securing Number Sense

Some pupils struggle to develop secure number sense. Strategies include:

- Additional practice with concrete resources
- Focused intervention on specific gaps
- Games and activities to build fluency
- Regular, short practice sessions

### Transition from Concrete to Abstract

Moving too quickly to abstract work can leave pupils with insecure understanding. Strategies include:

- Ensuring pupils are fluent at the concrete and pictorial stages before moving to abstract
- Returning to concrete resources when introducing new concepts or when pupils struggle
- Using manipulatives across all year groups, not only in early years

### Word Problems

Applying mathematics to word problems is challenging. Strategies include:

- Teaching problem-solving strategies explicitly
- Using bar models and other representations to make problems visible
- Building up from simple one-step problems to more complex multi-step problems
- Providing scaffolds that are gradually removed

### Mathematical Language

Some pupils struggle with the language demands of mathematics. Strategies include:

- Explicit vocabulary instruction
- Providing sentence stems and structures
- Pre-teaching vocabulary before new topics
- Using talk partners to rehearse explanations

## Transition to Key Stage 2

### Building Secure Foundations

By the end of Key Stage 1, pupils should have:

- Secure understanding of place value in two-digit numbers
- Fluency in addition and subtraction facts within 20, and strategies for working within 100
- Knowledge of 2, 5, and 10 times tables and related division facts
- Understanding of fractions as parts of wholes
- Experience of standard units of measurement
- Familiarity with common 2-D and 3-D shapes and their properties
- Ability to interpret simple data

These foundations enable pupils to access the more demanding KS2 curriculum, where they will work with larger numbers, more complex calculations, and a wider range of mathematical topics.

### Addressing Gaps

Pupils who have not achieved the expected standard by the end of Year 2 need targeted support:

- **Diagnostic assessment**: Identifying specific gaps in understanding
- **Catch-up programmes**: Focused intervention on number sense and calculation
- **Continued use of concrete resources**: Ensuring conceptual understanding, not just procedural fluency
- **Regular monitoring**: Checking that gaps are closing and fluency is developing

## Conclusion

Key Stage 1 mathematics is a critical period for establishing the foundations of mathematical understanding. The National Curriculum provides a clear, progressive framework that develops number sense, fluency, and problem-solving skills. By the end of Year 2, pupils should have secure understanding of place value, fluency in addition and subtraction, knowledge of multiplication tables, and experience of fractions, measurement, geometry, and statistics.

The statutory requirements balance conceptual understanding with procedural fluency, ensuring that pupils not only know how to calculate but understand why methods work. The concrete-pictorial-abstract approach supports this, ensuring that pupils build secure foundations before moving to abstract representations.

Teachers who maintain high expectations, provide rich mathematical experiences, and ensure that all pupils develop fluency and confidence give their pupils the best possible start in mathematics. The investment in early mathematics pays dividends throughout pupils' educational careers and beyond, as mathematical competence opens doors to further study, employment, and informed citizenship.

As pupils transition to Key Stage 2, the foundations laid in Years 1 and 2 enable them to tackle more complex mathematics with confidence and success. The secure number sense, fluency, and problem-solving skills developed at Key Stage 1 are the bedrock upon which all later mathematical achievement is built.
