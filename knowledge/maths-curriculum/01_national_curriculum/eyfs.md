# EYFS Mathematics: Early Learning Goals and Developmental Progression

## Introduction to Mathematics in the Early Years Foundation Stage

The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) establishes the crucial foundations for children's mathematical development. The 2021 revision of the EYFS framework represents a significant shift in approach, placing greater emphasis on deep understanding of number to 10 rather than breadth of counting. As the statutory framework states: "Developing a strong grounding in number is essential so that all children develop the necessary building blocks to excel mathematically."

Mathematics is one of the four specific areas of learning in the EYFS, alongside Literacy, Understanding the World, and Expressive Arts and Design. The mathematics area of learning is divided into two Early Learning Goals (ELGs): Number and Numerical Patterns. These goals work together to ensure children develop both quantitative understanding and the ability to recognise and work with patterns.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the statutory expectations, developmental progression, pedagogical approaches, and common misconceptions associated with EYFS mathematics. It draws upon the statutory EYFS framework (DfE, 2021), the non-statutory Development Matters guidance, and research-informed practice from organisations such as the NCETM (National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics).

## The Statutory Framework: Early Learning Goals

### The Number Early Learning Goal

The Number ELG sets out what children should know, understand, and be able to do by the end of Reception. Children at the expected level of development will:

- **Have a deep understanding of number to 10, including the composition of each number**: This goes far beyond reciting number names or counting to 10. Children should understand what each number represents, how it relates to other numbers, and the various ways each number can be composed and decomposed.

- **Subitise (recognise quantities without counting) up to 5**: Subitising is the ability to instantly recognise small quantities without counting. This skill supports efficient calculation and number sense throughout a child's mathematical education.

- **Automatically recall (without reference to rhymes, counting or other aids) number bonds up to 5 (including subtraction facts) and some number bonds to 10, including double facts**: Automatic recall means children can instantly state these facts without calculation or external support.

The language of the Number ELG is deliberately precise. The requirement for "deep understanding" signals a shift from rote memorisation to conceptual grasp. The specification of "without reference to rhymes, counting or other aids" for number bond recall emphasises the goal of developing genuine fluency.

### The Numerical Patterns Early Learning Goal

The Numerical Patterns ELG complements the Number ELG by focusing on comparison, pattern recognition, and early algebraic thinking. Children at the expected level of development will:

- **Verbally count beyond 20, recognising the pattern of the counting system**: This recognises that while deep understanding to 10 is essential, children should also be developing familiarity with the structure of the number system beyond this.

- **Compare quantities up to 10 in different contexts, recognising when one quantity is greater than, less than or the same as the other quantity**: Comparison is fundamental to developing number sense and underpins later work on calculation and estimation.

- **Explore and represent patterns within numbers up to 10, including evens and odds, double facts and how quantities can be distributed equally**: This introduces children to the structural properties of numbers and lays foundations for understanding multiplication, division, and fractions.

### Relationship Between the ELGs

The two ELGs are designed to work in tandem. The Number ELG focuses on depth—developing rich, connected understanding of the numbers to 10. The Numerical Patterns ELG focuses on breadth and structure—extending counting, developing comparison skills, and exploring patterns. Together, they ensure children have both deep understanding and broad experience of mathematical thinking.

The language used in the Numerical Patterns ELG—"explore, compare, recognise, represent"—encourages practical, activity-based learning. In contrast, the Number ELG uses more precise language reflecting the specific expectations for understanding and recall.

## Development Matters: The Progression Framework

### Overview of Development Matters

Development Matters is non-statutory guidance published by the Department for Education to support practitioners in implementing the EYFS. The 2021 revision aligns with the revised EYFS framework and provides age-band descriptors for children's development. For mathematics, the progression runs from birth to Reception, with three age bands: Birth to Three, Three and Four-Year-Olds, and Children in Reception.

### Mathematics in the Birth to Three Age Band

Even in the earliest years, children are developing foundational mathematical concepts. Development Matters identifies key characteristics of mathematics learning for this age group:

- **Combine objects like stacking blocks and cups. Put objects inside others and take them out again**: These activities develop understanding of space, size, and containment—foundations for later work on geometry and measurement.

- **Become aware of their own and others' bodies**: Developing body awareness supports later understanding of position, direction, and measurement.

- **Notice differences between people**: Early recognition of difference and similarity underpins classification and comparison.

- **Experiment with their own and others' shadows**: Play with shadows introduces concepts of light, space, and transformation.

- **Notice patterns and arrange things in patterns**: Pattern recognition is fundamental to mathematical thinking and is explicitly developed in the Reception year.

### Mathematics for Three and Four-Year-Olds

In the nursery years (typically ages 3-4), children develop more explicit mathematical skills. Development Matters highlights:

- **Develop fast recognition of up to 3 objects, without having to count them individually ('subitising')**: This early perceptual subitising (recognising small quantities instantly) develops before children can count reliably.

- **Recite numbers past 5**: Children begin to learn the counting sequence, though they may not yet understand what each number represents.

- **Say one number for each item in order: 1,2,3,4,5**: This indicates developing one-to-one correspondence—the understanding that each object counted corresponds to one number word.

- **Show 'finger numbers' up to 5**: Children begin to represent quantities using their fingers, developing the link between symbolic representation and quantity.

- **Link numerals and amounts**: For example, showing the right number of objects to match the numeral, up to 5.

- **Experiment with their own symbols and marks as well as numerals**: Children begin to represent quantity through their own drawings and marks, developing early mathematical recording.

- **Solve real world mathematical problems with numbers up to 5**: Children apply their developing understanding to practical situations, such as sharing snacks or distributing resources.

- **Talk about and explore 2D and 3D shapes**: Children begin to name and describe shapes, using everyday language such as 'pointy', 'round', and 'curvy'.

- **Understand position through words alone**: For example, "The bag is under the table"—with no pointing.

- **Describe a familiar route**: Developing spatial awareness and memory for sequences.

- **Discuss routes and locations, using words like 'in front of' and 'behind'**: Building positional vocabulary.

- **Make comparisons between objects relating to size, length, weight and capacity**: Children use comparison language such as 'bigger', 'longer', 'heavier', and 'full'.

- **Select shapes appropriately**: For example, flat surfaces for building, a triangular prism for a roof.

- **Combine shapes to make new ones**: An arch, a bigger triangle, etc.

- **Talk about and identify the patterns around them**: For example, stripes on clothes, designs on rugs and wallpaper.

- **Extend and create ABAB patterns—stick, leaf, stick, leaf**: Children recognise repeating patterns and can continue them.

- **Notice and correct an error in a repeating pattern**: Children can identify when a pattern is broken and restore it.

- **Begin to describe a sequence of events, real or fictional, using words such as 'first', 'then'**: Developing the language of sequence and order.

### Mathematics in Reception

For children in Reception, Development Matters provides detailed guidance on the knowledge and understanding children should develop to meet the ELGs:

**Number**
- Count objects, actions and sounds
- Subitise
- Link the number symbol (numeral) with its cardinal number value
- Count beyond ten
- Compare numbers
- Understand the 'one more than/one less than' relationship between consecutive numbers
- Explore the composition of numbers to 10
- Automatically recall number bonds for numbers 0–5 and some to 10

**Numerical Patterns**
- Verbally count beyond 20, recognising the pattern of the counting system
- Compare quantities up to 10 in different contexts
- Recognise when one quantity is greater than, less than or the same as the other quantity
- Explore and represent patterns within numbers up to 10, including evens and odds, double facts and how quantities can be distributed equally

## Key Concepts in EYFS Mathematics

### Cardinality

Cardinality refers to understanding that the last number word said when counting a set of objects represents the total quantity of the set. This is often called the cardinal principle or cardinal word principle. For example, when counting a set of four objects—"one, two, three, four"—the child understands that "four" represents the total number of objects, not just the last one counted.

The NCETM emphasises that cardinality is "the capacity to link numbers to collections." Research has shown that children typically develop this understanding between ages 3 and 5, and that secure understanding of cardinality is foundational for all subsequent number work.

Teaching strategies for developing cardinality include:
- Counting real objects in meaningful contexts
- Emphasising the total quantity after counting
- Using the "how many?" question to focus attention on the cardinal value
- Playing games that involve comparing quantities

### Ordinality

Ordinality refers to understanding numbers as representing position in a sequence. This includes:
- Understanding the order of counting words (one, two, three...)
- Recognising that each number is one more than the previous number
- Understanding first, second, third in practical contexts
- Recognising that numbers have a magnitude relative to each other

The NCETM notes that ordinality is "more than just learning the language of 'first, second, third'." It involves understanding the relationships between numbers—the fact that 7 is more than 6, that 5 is between 4 and 6, that the number system is ordered.

Teaching strategies for developing ordinality include:
- Using number lines and number tracks
- Placing numbers in order
- Discussing which number comes before or after another
- Using ordinal language in everyday contexts (lining up, races, sequences)

### Subitising

Subitising is the ability to recognise small quantities without counting. There are two types:

**Perceptual subitising** is the instant recognition of small quantities (typically up to 3 or 4) without any calculation. For example, seeing three dots on a dice and knowing it is three without counting. This appears to be an innate capacity that even infants possess.

**Conceptual subitising** involves recognising larger quantities by seeing them as combinations of smaller groups. For example, seeing six dots as two groups of three, or as three groups of two. This requires understanding of part-whole relationships and underpins mental calculation.

The EYFS framework expects children to subitise up to 5 by the end of Reception. The NCETM Mastering Number programme provides extensive guidance on developing subitising, including the use of:
- Dice and domino patterns
- Ten frames and 9-grids
- Fingers
- Structured arrangements of objects

### Composition of Number

Understanding composition means knowing that numbers are made up of other numbers—that 5 can be composed of 2 and 3, or 1 and 4, or 2 and 2 and 1. This understanding is fundamental to addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The EYFS framework explicitly requires "deep understanding of number to 10, including the composition of each number." This is a significant shift from previous approaches that focused more on counting and numeral recognition.

The NCETM identifies several key aspects of composition:
- **Part-whole**: Identifying smaller numbers within a number (conceptual subitising)
- **5 and a bit**: Recognising that numbers 6-10 can be seen as 5 plus some more
- **Doubles**: Recognising doubles patterns (2+2, 3+3, etc.)
- **Near doubles**: Using known doubles to calculate near doubles (5+6 is double 5 plus 1)

Teaching strategies for developing composition include:
- Using part-whole models
- Exploring number bonds through practical activities
- Playing games that involve partitioning and combining quantities
- Using manipulatives such as double-sided counters

### Comparison

Comparison involves identifying which of two quantities is greater, which is less, or whether they are equal. This skill underpins understanding of magnitude, estimation, and calculation.

Development Matters emphasises that children should "compare quantities up to 10 in different contexts." This means children should be able to compare not just concrete objects but also abstract quantities, and should be able to do so in various situations.

Teaching strategies for developing comparison include:
- Direct comparison of two sets (lining up objects to compare)
- Using comparison language (more than, less than, the same as, fewer)
- Ordering three or more quantities
- Estimating before counting

## Pedagogical Approaches for EYFS Mathematics

### The Mastering Number Programme

The NCETM Mastering Number programme, launched in 2021, provides a structured approach to developing number sense in Reception and Key Stage 1. The programme is based on research evidence and is designed to secure firm foundations in the development of good number sense for all children.

The Mastering Number programme is organised around six key areas:
1. **Subitising**: Developing the ability to recognise quantities without counting
2. **Cardinality**: Understanding that the last number counted represents the total
3. **Composition**: Understanding that numbers are made up of other numbers
4. **Comparison**: Understanding relative magnitude
5. **Counting**: Developing fluent, accurate counting
6. **Pattern**: Recognising and extending patterns

The programme provides detailed session plans, teaching materials, and professional development for teachers. Schools participating in the programme receive training and resources free of charge through the Maths Hubs network.

### Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) in the Early Years

While the CPA approach is often associated with the Singapore mastery model used in primary schools, its principles are equally applicable in the early years. In EYFS:

**Concrete**: Children work with physical objects—counters, blocks, fingers, natural materials. The emphasis is on hands-on experience with real quantities.

**Pictorial**: Children use drawings, diagrams, and visual representations. In Reception, this might include simple marks, tally charts, or structured representations like ten frames.

**Abstract**: Children work with numerals and symbols. In EYFS, this includes recognising and writing numerals, understanding that numerals represent quantities.

The progression is not strictly linear—children should move between concrete, pictorial, and abstract representations as appropriate to the task and their level of understanding.

### Play-Based Learning

The EYFS framework emphasises that learning should be play-based and child-initiated. Mathematics should be embedded in meaningful contexts rather than taught as isolated exercises. Effective practice includes:

- **Maths in the environment**: Creating a mathematically rich environment with numbers, shapes, patterns, and measuring tools readily available
- **Mathematical talk**: Adults modelling mathematical language and asking questions that promote mathematical thinking
- **Child-initiated play**: Following children's interests and incorporating mathematical concepts into their play
- **Adult-guided activities**: Short, focused teaching sessions that introduce or consolidate specific concepts

Birth to 5 Matters (the non-statutory guidance developed by the sector) emphasises that "children's mathematical development occurs as a result of their experiences in a range of contexts, through the relationships they form and through their own inherent interest in problem-solving."

### The Role of the Adult

Adults play a crucial role in developing children's mathematical thinking. Effective adult interactions include:

- **Modelling mathematical language**: Using precise mathematical vocabulary in context
- **Asking open-ended questions**: "How do you know?", "What do you notice?", "Is there another way?"
- **Scaffolding learning**: Providing just enough support to enable children to succeed
- **Extending thinking**: Building on what children can already do, introducing new challenges
- **Making connections**: Helping children see links between different mathematical ideas and between mathematics and their everyday lives

The DfE's "Help for Early Years Providers" guidance provides extensive examples of how adults can support mathematical development through everyday interactions.

## Common Misconceptions in EYFS Mathematics

### Misconception 1: Reciting Numbers Equals Understanding Quantity

Many children can recite number words to 20 or beyond without understanding what these words represent. They may have learned the sequence as a rhyme without grasping that each number word represents a specific quantity.

**Addressing this misconception**:
- Emphasise counting real objects rather than just reciting numbers
- Ask "how many?" after counting to focus attention on quantity
- Compare quantities directly to develop understanding of magnitude
- Use subitising activities to develop recognition of quantity without counting

### Misconception 2: Counting Objects in the Wrong Order

Children may not yet understand the one-to-one principle—that each object should be counted once and only once. They may count objects multiple times, miss objects, or count in an irregular order.

**Addressing this misconception**:
- Model counting by touching or moving objects
- Encourage children to organise objects before counting
- Use activities that require accurate counting for a purpose
- Play games that involve counting where accuracy matters

### Misconception 3: The Last Number Word is a Label for the Last Object

Some children think that the last number word said refers only to the last object counted, rather than representing the total quantity of the set. For example, when counting four objects, they think "four" is the name of the fourth object, not the total.

**Addressing this misconception**:
- Emphasise the total quantity after counting
- Ask "how many altogether?" to focus on the cardinal value
- Use activities where children need to state the total without recounting
- Play games that involve remembering totals

### Misconception 4: Bigger Numbers Always Mean Bigger Objects

Children may associate the magnitude of a number with the physical size of the objects. For example, thinking that a set of 5 large objects is "more" than a set of 7 small objects.

**Addressing this misconception**:
- Compare sets with objects of different sizes
- Use comparison activities that focus on number rather than size
- Discuss how number and size are different concepts
- Use subitising to develop understanding that quantity is independent of object size

### Misconception 5: Number Bonds Are Just Facts to Memorise

Children may learn number bond facts without understanding the relationships they represent. For example, knowing that 3 + 2 = 5 without understanding that this means 3 and 2 can be combined to make 5.

**Addressing this misconception**:
- Explore number bonds practically using objects
- Use part-whole models to show the relationship between parts and the whole
- Connect number bonds to real-world contexts
- Encourage children to explain why number bonds work

## Assessment and Observation

### The EYFS Profile

At the end of Reception, teachers complete the EYFS Profile for each child, assessing them against the Early Learning Goals. For mathematics, this involves making a holistic judgement based on observations and interactions throughout the year.

The EYFS Profile uses a three-point scale:
- **Emerging**: Not yet at the expected level
- **Expected**: Meeting the expected level
- **Exceeding**: Beyond the expected level

The EYFS Profile Handbook provides exemplification materials to support teachers in making accurate judgements. The handbook emphasises that teachers should use their professional judgement, drawing on knowledge of the child and evidence gathered through observation and interaction.

### Observation and Assessment Strategies

Effective assessment in EYFS mathematics relies on:

- **Ongoing observation**: Watching children in their play and activities to see what they can do
- **Interactions**: Talking with children about their mathematical thinking
- **Documentation**: Recording examples of children's mathematical behaviour
- **Assessment for learning**: Using assessment to inform planning and teaching

Development Matters is clear that assessment should not be through formal testing but should be "based on observational evidence, and on the practitioner’s knowledge of the child."

### Transition to Key Stage 1

The EYFS mathematics curriculum is designed to provide foundations for the Key Stage 1 National Curriculum. Key areas of continuity include:

- Counting and number recognition continue to be developed
- Number bonds to 10 are extended to number bonds to 20 and beyond
- Place value concepts introduced through "5 and a bit" are developed further
- Comparison skills support understanding of inequality symbols
- Pattern recognition supports work on sequences and algebra

The Mastering Number programme explicitly bridges EYFS and KS1, providing continuity in approach and language.

## Supporting All Children

### Children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND)

The EYFS framework is inclusive—all children should have opportunities to develop their mathematical thinking. For children with SEND, this may involve:
- Adapting activities to meet specific needs
- Using specialised equipment or resources
- Providing additional time and repetition
- Focusing on fewer concepts but in greater depth

The DfE's "Help for Early Years Providers" includes specific guidance on supporting children with SEND in mathematics.

### Children Learning English as an Additional Language (EAL)

Mathematics provides opportunities for children learning EAL to develop language in meaningful contexts. Support strategies include:
- Using practical, concrete resources to support understanding
- Modelling mathematical language explicitly
- Providing visual supports such as number lines and ten frames
- Allowing children to demonstrate understanding through action rather than words
- Using children's home languages where possible to support conceptual understanding

### High-Attaining Children

The EYFS framework states that children should not be pushed beyond what they are ready to learn. However, high-attaining children should be provided with opportunities to deepen their understanding rather than simply being introduced to content from later year groups. This might involve:
- Exploring number bonds in different contexts
- Solving more complex problems using familiar numbers
- Explaining their thinking to others
- Finding multiple ways to solve a problem

## Conclusion

The 2021 EYFS mathematics framework represents a significant shift towards deep understanding of number. The emphasis on composition, subitising, and automatic recall of number facts reflects research evidence about what matters most for children's mathematical development.

Key messages for practitioners include:

1. **Depth before breadth**: Focus on deep understanding of numbers to 10 rather than rushing to larger numbers
2. **Concrete experiences**: Provide hands-on experiences with real objects to develop conceptual understanding
3. **Mathematical talk**: Model mathematical language and engage children in mathematical conversation
4. **Play-based learning**: Embed mathematics in meaningful, child-initiated contexts
5. **Address misconceptions**: Anticipate and address common misconceptions explicitly

The foundations laid in the EYFS have lasting impact on children's mathematical attainment. Children who develop strong number sense in the early years are better placed to succeed in mathematics throughout their school careers. As the statutory framework states, developing a strong grounding in number is essential so that all children develop the necessary building blocks to excel mathematically—not just in school, but in life.
