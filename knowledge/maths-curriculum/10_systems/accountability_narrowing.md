# Accountability and Curriculum Narrowing in Mathematics Education

## Overview

Accountability measures in English education have created significant tensions between the pursuit of strong examination outcomes and the development of deep, lasting mathematical understanding. The Ofsted subject report *Coordinating Mathematical Success* (July 2023) explicitly identifies how external pressures drive schools to narrow their curricula, particularly in high-stakes years such as Year 6 (Key Stage 2 SATs) and Years 10-11 (GCSE preparation). This knowledge file examines the mechanisms of accountability, their impact on curriculum design and pedagogy, and strategies for maintaining mathematical integrity while meeting external requirements.

## The Accountability Landscape

### Floor Standards and Coasting Schools

The Department for Education (DfE) operates a dual accountability framework for primary schools. **Floor standards** define the minimum acceptable performance, while the **coasting schools** definition captures institutions where results have remained static over a three-year period despite not necessarily falling below minimum thresholds. A primary school is identified as coasting when fewer than 85% of pupils achieve the expected standard in English reading, English writing and mathematics, whilst also falling below the national median percentage of pupils making expected progress across these subjects. This creates powerful incentives for schools to focus disproportionate attention on pupils near threshold boundaries.

The Education Policy Institute has documented how these measures, introduced as part of the 2016 accountability reforms, shifted attention from raw attainment to progress measures. Whilst theoretically more equitable, progress measures based on Key Stage 1 to Key Stage 2 trajectories still generate perverse incentives. Schools face intense pressure to demonstrate sufficient progress, particularly for pupils whose prior attainment suggests they are at risk of falling below expected standards.

### The Progress 8 Context in Secondary Schools

At secondary level, the Progress 8 metric fundamentally shapes school behaviour. This measure compares pupils' actual GCSE attainment against their predicted attainment based on Key Stage 2 results. Mathematics carries double weighting in Progress 8 calculations, making it disproportionately significant for overall school performance measures. The combination of high stakes and double weighting creates conditions where curriculum narrowing becomes a rational organisational response to accountability pressure.

Mathematics departments face particular scrutiny because the subject serves as a gatekeeper to further education and employment. Grade 4 (the standard pass) and Grade 5 (the strong pass) function as critical thresholds. The reformed GCSE mathematics, introduced in 2017 with 9-1 grading, features higher demand at the top end and more sophisticated assessment of problem-solving. Grade boundaries fluctuate based on cohort performance, creating uncertainty that drives risk-averse curriculum decisions.

## Manifestations of Curriculum Narrowing

### The Year 6 Focus in Primary Mathematics

Ofsted's 2023 report is explicit about the **distorting effect of Key Stage 2 SATs** on primary mathematics curricula. In many schools, the entire Year 6 programme becomes dominated by examination preparation. Teachers report spending the autumn and spring terms teaching test technique, practising past papers, and drilling procedures that are likely to appear on the assessments. The final term, after SATs are completed, often becomes mathematically barren as attention shifts to other activities.

This narrowing manifests in several ways. **Curriculum compression** occurs when schools accelerate coverage of Years 3-5 content to create extended preparation time in Year 6. **Content selection** privileges topics with high examination weighting whilst marginalising those deemed less significant. Geometry, statistics and measurement often receive reduced attention compared to number and calculation. **Pedagogical regression** sees sophisticated teaching approaches abandoned in favour of direct instruction and repetitive practice.

The consequences for mathematical understanding are significant. Pupils may achieve acceptable SATs scores whilst lacking the conceptual foundations needed for secondary mathematics. The Ofsted report notes that "pupils are taught a narrowed curriculum that allows them to be successful in exams without securing the mathematical knowledge they need to be successful later." This creates transition problems as Year 7 teachers encounter pupils whose apparent proficiency masks fragile understanding.

### GCSE Preparation and the Exam Factory Model

Secondary schools face equivalent pressures, particularly in Years 10 and 11. The **exam factory** critique, articulated by educational researchers and teaching unions, describes how accountability measures transform schools into institutions focused primarily on examination performance. In mathematics, this manifests as:

**Early entry practices**, where schools enter pupils for GCSE mathematics before the end of Year 11. Whilst sometimes justified as reducing pressure or providing resit opportunities, early entry frequently reflects strategic attempts to secure passes that contribute to performance measures. The NCETM and Ofsted have raised concerns about early entry limiting mathematical development by capping aspiration and truncating curriculum coverage.

**Tiering decisions** that prioritise securing Grade 4 passes over stretching higher-attaining pupils. Foundation tier papers (graded 5-1) offer more accessible routes to standard passes but preclude access to higher grades. Schools under pressure may make tiering decisions based on accountability needs rather than individual pupil potential.

**Specification gaming**, where schools select examination boards or specifications based on perceived accessibility rather than mathematical coherence. Whilst the standardisation of GCSE mathematics through the 2015 reforms reduced variation between boards, subtle differences in assessment style and content emphasis continue to influence decision-making.

### The Impact on Mathematical Depth

Curriculum narrowing fundamentally conflicts with the **teaching for mastery** approach advocated by the NCETM and embedded in the national curriculum. Mastery teaching requires time for pupils to develop deep conceptual understanding through extended exploration of mathematical structures. Accountability pressures, conversely, reward rapid coverage and procedural fluency.

The Ofsted report documents how this tension plays out in classrooms. Schools under pressure may abandon approaches that develop mathematical thinking in favour of those that produce immediate performance gains. Problem-solving, reasoning and mathematical communication—central to the national curriculum aims—receive reduced attention when examination performance is paramount. The report calls for the DfE, Ofqual and awarding bodies to explore whether GCSE design contributes negatively to these practices.

## Threshold Grades and Their Impact

### The Grade 4/5 Distinction

The reformed GCSE created a critical distinction between Grade 4 (standard pass) and Grade 5 (strong pass). Grade 4 aligns with the former Grade C, whilst Grade 5 represents a higher benchmark positioned between the old C and B grades. This distinction carries significant practical consequences: Grade 4 satisfies basic progression requirements, whilst Grade 5 is increasingly required for entry to selective post-16 courses and apprenticeships.

For schools, the strong pass measure creates additional pressure. Performance tables report the proportion of pupils achieving Grade 5 or above in both English and mathematics. This headline measure influences parental choice, inspection judgements and school reputation. Mathematics departments consequently face pressure to move pupils from Grade 4 to Grade 5 performance, even where the pupil's overall attainment profile suggests this may not represent appropriate challenge.

### Strategic Resource Allocation

Threshold grades drive **strategic resource allocation** that may conflict with equity principles. Schools facing accountability pressure naturally concentrate resources where they will have maximum impact on headline measures. This typically means focusing on pupils predicted Grade 3-4 borderline performance, where intervention can convert failures into passes. Pupils securely below Grade 4 or comfortably above Grade 5 may receive less intensive support.

The Ofsted report notes this pattern whilst acknowledging that it "occurs as a result of accountability measures and external pressures" rather than teacher choice. The systemic nature of the problem requires systemic responses. Individual schools that resist narrowing face competitive disadvantage in admissions markets and inspection frameworks.

### Pupil Experience and Wellbeing

The intensity of examination pressure affects pupil experience of mathematics. Research by the NSPCC and Childline has documented how SATs and GCSE preparation contributes to anxiety and stress among young people. Mathematics, as a high-stakes subject with significant weighting in accountability measures, features prominently in pupil concerns.

The narrowing of curriculum compounds these wellbeing impacts. When mathematics becomes reduced to test preparation, pupils lose opportunities to experience the subject's creative, exploratory dimensions. The joy of mathematical discovery gives way to the anxiety of examination performance. This affects not only current wellbeing but long-term disposition towards the subject.

## Systemic Responses and Reforms

### Ofsted's Curriculum Focus

The 2019 Ofsted framework introduced the **quality of education** judgement, explicitly evaluating curriculum design and implementation. This shifted inspection focus from examination outcomes alone to the broader educational offer. The mathematics subject report applies this lens, assessing whether curricula provide secure foundations for future learning or merely prepare for immediate assessments.

Inspectors now evaluate whether "external examinations are not the main focus of curriculum intent and design, particularly in Years 6, 10 and 11." Schools with narrowed curricula face critique even where examination results appear strong. The framework encourages attention to long-term mathematical development over short-term performance gains.

### Progress Measures and Their Limitations

The shift from raw attainment to progress measures represented an attempt to reduce perverse incentives. Progress 8, in theory, rewards schools for developing all pupils regardless of starting point. However, the measure retains limitations:

**Attainment 8 calculation** still depends heavily on examination performance, creating pressure for grade-focused teaching. **English Baccalaureate** requirements incentivise particular subject combinations that may not suit all pupils. **Baselines** based on Key Stage 2 assessments may not accurately reflect mathematical starting points, particularly where primary preparation has itself been narrowed.

The NCETM has called for assessment reforms that align more closely with teaching for mastery principles. This includes reduced curriculum content to enable depth, assessment focused on secure understanding rather than procedural fluency, and recognition of mathematical development beyond grade boundaries.

### Trust-Level Accountability

Multi-academy trusts operate under different accountability structures than individual schools. Trust-level metrics aggregate performance across multiple institutions, potentially reducing the salience of marginal gains at individual schools. This creates space for trusts to prioritise long-term curriculum development over short-term performance optimisation.

However, trust accountability remains dominated by examination outcomes. Regional Schools Commissioners and DfE performance tables apply similar frameworks regardless of organisational structure. Trusts seeking to resist curriculum narrowing require explicit leadership commitment and willingness to accept temporary performance fluctuations.

## Strategies for Maintaining Mathematical Integrity

### Curriculum Coherence Over Coverage

Schools that resist narrowing typically prioritise **curriculum coherence** over content coverage. This means ensuring that mathematical content connects meaningfully across topics and key stages, rather than treating the curriculum as a checklist of discrete items. Coherent curricula build systematically, with each element preparing for future learning.

The NCETM's curriculum materials exemplify this approach, mapping content across key stages to emphasise connections and prerequisites. Schools using these materials can justify curriculum decisions based on mathematical logic rather than assessment weighting. When accountability pressures challenge curriculum choices, leaders can reference the coherent design as educational rationale.

### Assessment Literacy

Developing **assessment literacy** across the mathematics department helps teachers distinguish between genuine understanding and examination performance. Teachers who understand assessment design can prepare pupils for examinations without abandoning deep teaching. They recognise which examination questions assess conceptual understanding and which reward procedural recall.

Professional development in assessment literacy includes understanding mark schemes, recognising common misconceptions that examinations target, and developing formative assessment practices that predict performance whilst supporting learning. This knowledge enables teachers to maintain mathematical integrity whilst meeting accountability requirements.

### Protected Curriculum Time

Some schools have experimented with **protected curriculum time** arrangements that insulate mathematics from examination pressure. This might involve:

- **Core curriculum** that continues regardless of examination proximity, ensuring coverage of non-assessed but mathematically essential content
- **Enrichment time** explicitly protected from examination preparation, maintaining exploration and problem-solving
- **Transition programmes** between key stages that address foundational gaps without immediate assessment focus

These arrangements require leadership commitment and clear communication with stakeholders. Parents and governors accustomed to high-stakes accountability may question time allocations that do not obviously contribute to examination performance.

### Professional Collaboration

Mathematics teachers working in isolation are more vulnerable to accountability pressures than those engaged in **professional collaboration**. Subject communities—whether within schools, across trusts, or through organisations like the NCETM, Mathematical Association and Association of Teachers of Mathematics—provide:

- **Shared resources** that embody ambitious mathematical teaching
- **Professional dialogue** that maintains focus on long-term development
- **Collective resistance** to narrowing pressures through shared values
- **Alternative accountability** to professional standards and mathematical integrity

Schools that invest in subject-specific professional development create conditions where teachers can resist external pressures. The NCETM's teaching for mastery programme, for example, provides a framework for curriculum and pedagogy grounded in mathematical coherence rather than assessment optimisation.

## Key Thinkers and Research

### The Education Policy Institute Analysis

The Education Policy Institute's research on primary accountability has documented how floor standards and coasting definitions shape school behaviour. Their analysis shows that accountability measures have driven genuine improvements in some schools whilst creating perverse incentives in others. The institute advocates for nuanced accountability frameworks that recognise school context and pupil intake.

### Ofsted's Subject Deep Dives

The mathematics subject report represents a significant evolution in Ofsted's approach. By examining the relationship between curriculum, pedagogy and assessment, inspectors can identify narrowing even where examination results appear acceptable. The report's explicit acknowledgment that "this is often beyond the control of teachers and leaders" signals systemic rather than individual responsibility.

### NCETM Advocacy

The National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics consistently advocates for curriculum and assessment reform aligned with teaching for mastery. Their publications emphasise the tension between depth and coverage, arguing for reduced content to enable secure understanding. The centre's influence on policy discussions provides theoretical grounding for schools seeking to resist narrowing pressures.

## Classroom Implications

### For Primary Teachers

Primary teachers in Year 6 face the most acute accountability pressures. Strategies for maintaining mathematical integrity include:

- **Diagnostic assessment** that identifies genuine understanding gaps rather than examination technique weaknesses
- **Spiralled revisiting** of earlier content that strengthens foundations rather than superficially practising test formats
- **Mathematical talk** that maintains reasoning and explanation even during preparation periods
- **Post-SATs curriculum** that addresses conceptual gaps before secondary transition

### For Secondary Teachers

Secondary mathematics teachers encounter accountability pressures across multiple year groups. GCSE classes require careful balance between examination preparation and mathematical development. Earlier key stages offer opportunities to build foundations that resist narrowing. Key Stage 3, in particular, should provide space for mathematical exploration before GCSE specifications constrain content.

### For Subject Leaders

Mathematics subject leaders carry responsibility for curriculum design that balances external requirements with mathematical integrity. This requires:

- **Clear curriculum rationale** documented and communicated to stakeholders
- **Assessment mapping** that shows how different assessment types serve different purposes
- **Quality assurance** that monitors teaching quality beyond examination results
- **Stakeholder communication** that explains long-term mathematical development to parents and governors

## Conclusion

Accountability and curriculum narrowing represent systemic challenges that individual schools and teachers cannot resolve alone. The Ofsted subject report's acknowledgment of external pressures signals recognition at the highest levels that the current system creates perverse incentives. Nevertheless, schools and mathematics departments retain agency in how they respond to these pressures.

Maintaining mathematical integrity under accountability pressure requires clear curriculum vision, professional collaboration, and leadership commitment. Schools that prioritise deep understanding over superficial performance may face short-term disadvantage in competitive metrics. However, they produce pupils with the mathematical foundations necessary for long-term success—an outcome that ultimately serves both individual learners and the broader educational system.

The tension between accountability and curriculum breadth is not unique to mathematics, but the subject's high stakes and clear metrics make the dynamics particularly visible. Mathematics educators have a particular responsibility to advocate for assessment and accountability reforms that align with the subject's disciplinary values. The NCETM's call for curriculum and assessment reform that supports teaching for mastery represents a pathway towards reconciliation of these competing demands.
