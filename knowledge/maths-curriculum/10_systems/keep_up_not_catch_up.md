# Keep Up, Not Catch Up: Early Intervention and Mastery Approaches in Mathematics

## Introduction: The Imperative for Early Intervention

The phrase "keep up, not catch up" encapsulates a fundamental shift in how mathematics education approaches pupil progression. Rather than allowing learners to fall behind and then attempting remediation through catch-up programmes, this philosophy emphasises identifying gaps swiftly and addressing them immediately—before they compound into significant barriers to learning.

The rationale for this approach is rooted in the cumulative nature of mathematical knowledge. Mathematics is a hierarchical subject; concepts build upon one another in intricate webs of dependency. A pupil who fails to secure understanding of place value in Year 3 will struggle with column addition in Year 4, multiplication algorithms in Year 5, and algebraic manipulation in secondary school. What begins as a small gap can, over time, widen into a chasm that seems insurmountable.

The Department for Education (DfE) has consistently emphasised the importance of addressing gaps promptly. The National Curriculum for mathematics states that pupils who grasp concepts rapidly should be challenged through rich and sophisticated problems before any acceleration through new content. Conversely, those who are not sufficiently fluent with earlier material should consolidate their understanding through additional practice before moving on. This principle of consolidation before progression lies at the heart of the "keep up" philosophy.

## The Challenge of Cumulative Disadvantage

### Understanding Cumulative Disadvantage in Mathematics

Cumulative disadvantage in mathematics education refers to the phenomenon whereby initial difficulties, if unaddressed, compound over time to create ever-widening attainment gaps. The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) has identified mathematics as a subject particularly susceptible to this pattern, noting that gaps in foundational knowledge can have disproportionate effects on subsequent learning.

Research by the EEF suggests that pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds are particularly vulnerable to cumulative disadvantage in mathematics. These pupils may begin school with less exposure to mathematical language and concepts, and without swift intervention, early gaps can rapidly expand. By Key Stage 2, disadvantaged pupils are, on average, significantly behind their peers in mathematics attainment. By Key Stage 4, this gap has often become entrenched, with profound implications for future educational and employment opportunities.

The mechanisms of cumulative disadvantage in mathematics are multifaceted. At the cognitive level, working memory limitations mean that pupils who lack automaticity with basic facts must devote disproportionate cognitive resources to simple calculations, leaving insufficient capacity for higher-order reasoning. At the affective level, repeated experiences of failure can lead to mathematics anxiety, which itself impairs working memory and creates a vicious cycle of underperformance. At the curricular level, pacing schedules that move too rapidly for some pupils ensure that gaps accumulate faster than they can be addressed.

### The Cost of Catch-Up

Traditional approaches to addressing mathematical underachievement have often relied on catch-up programmes—intensive interventions delivered after significant gaps have already developed. While well-intentioned, such programmes face substantial challenges.

First, catch-up programmes must compete with the ongoing curriculum. Pupils attending catch-up sessions are often expected to keep pace with their regular lessons simultaneously, creating a double burden. They must attempt to master current content whilst also addressing fundamental gaps that may be years behind their current level.

Second, the scale of intervention required increases exponentially as gaps widen. A pupil who has fallen two years behind in mathematics may require hundreds of hours of targeted support to return to age-related expectations. The EEF notes that intensive catch-up interventions are costly and often yield modest effect sizes precisely because the challenge is so substantial.

Third, catch-up programmes can carry stigma. Pupils removed from lessons for intervention may feel labelled as "strugglers," affecting their motivation and self-concept as mathematics learners. This psychological barrier can undermine even technically well-designed interventions.

## Early Identification: Diagnostic Approaches

### The Role of Diagnostic Assessment

Swift identification of gaps is essential to the "keep up" approach. Diagnostic assessment—designed not to grade pupils but to reveal specific misconceptions and gaps—provides the foundation for targeted intervention.

Craig Barton, a prominent mathematics educator, has popularised the use of diagnostic questions in mathematics teaching. A well-constructed diagnostic question has the following characteristics: it is clear and unambiguous; it tests a single skill or concept; it can be answered quickly (in under ten seconds); and crucially, each incorrect answer reveals a specific misconception. When pupils respond to such questions, their answers provide immediate insight into their thinking.

For example, consider the question: "What is 3 + 4 × 2?" The correct answer is 11 (following the order of operations). A pupil who answers 14 may believe that addition always precedes multiplication. A pupil who answers 10 may have misapplied the multiplication. Each wrong answer tells a different story about the pupil's understanding, enabling the teacher to respond precisely.

Diagnostic assessment should be embedded within regular teaching, not confined to formal testing periods. Skilled teachers use questioning throughout lessons to probe understanding, using techniques such as "show me" boards or digital response systems to gather real-time data on pupil thinking. This ongoing formative assessment enables gaps to be identified within minutes or hours of their emergence, rather than weeks or months later.

### Common Mathematical Misconceptions

Effective diagnostic assessment requires knowledge of the misconceptions commonly held at each stage of mathematical development. Research has identified patterns of misconception that recur across pupils and contexts.

In early number, common misconceptions include the belief that larger numbers always represent larger quantities (problematic when comparing negative numbers or decimals), that multiplication always makes numbers bigger, and that division always makes them smaller. In fractions, pupils often struggle with the part-whole relationship, treating numerators and denominators as separate whole numbers rather than as a unified relationship. In algebra, the equals sign is frequently misunderstood as an instruction to calculate rather than as a symbol of equivalence.

Understanding these predictable misconceptions enables teachers to anticipate and identify them swiftly. When a Year 7 pupil writes that 3 + 4 × 2 = 14, the teacher recognises not random error but a systematic misunderstanding about operation order that can be addressed explicitly.

### Assessment for Learning Strategies

The Assessment for Learning (AfL) movement has provided a range of strategies for identifying gaps during everyday teaching. These include:

**Traffic lighting** systems where pupils indicate their confidence with concepts using coloured cards, enabling teachers to identify who needs additional support.

**Exit tickets** collected at the end of lessons, providing a snapshot of understanding that informs the next lesson's planning.

**Hinge questions** asked at critical junctures in lessons—moments where the teacher needs to know whether to move forward or consolidate. Pupils respond simultaneously (using fingers, mini-whiteboards, or digital tools), providing instant class-wide data.

**Error analysis** tasks where pupils are presented with worked solutions containing deliberate errors and asked to identify and correct them. Such tasks reveal whether pupils can recognise correct mathematical reasoning.

When embedded consistently, these strategies create a classroom culture where gaps are surfaced and addressed as a matter of routine, before they can accumulate.

## Same-Day Intervention

### The Same-Day Intervention Model

Same-day intervention represents one of the most concrete implementations of the "keep up" philosophy. Developed by the Outwood Institute of Education and evaluated by the EEF, this approach restructures the mathematics lesson to create space for immediate response to identified gaps.

In a typical same-day intervention lesson, the structure follows three phases. First, the teacher models new learning using an "I do, you do" approach, gradually releasing responsibility to pupils. This phase lasts approximately 30 minutes and includes opportunities for pupils to work independently on carefully designed tasks.

During this independent work, the teacher circulates, using diagnostic questioning to identify which pupils have grasped the concept and which require additional support. This assessment is immediate and specific; the teacher is not waiting for end-of-lesson plenaries or next-day marking to discover gaps.

Following the independent work phase, pupils who have demonstrated secure understanding attend assembly or engage in enrichment activities for approximately 15 minutes. Meanwhile, those who need additional support remain with the teacher for focused intervention. This additional time, delivered on the same day as the initial instruction, addresses gaps before they can solidify.

The EEF evaluation of same-day intervention found promising results. The approach combines elements of mastery learning (frequent feedback, additional time for struggling pupils) with other evidence-based practices (formative assessment, collaborative learning). While effect sizes were moderate, the approach was particularly effective at narrowing the attainment gap between lower and higher attaining pupils.

### Structuring for Intervention

Implementing same-day intervention requires careful organisational planning. Schools must allocate resources—staff time, classroom space, timetabling flexibility—to enable the additional 15-minute intervention slot.

Some schools achieve this by employing teaching assistants to supervise assembly or enrichment activities while the class teacher works with the intervention group. Others release other teachers or senior leaders to provide cover. The specific organisational solution matters less than the principle: creating protected time for same-day response to identified needs.

The intervention itself should be tightly focused. With only 15 minutes, the teacher cannot attempt comprehensive remediation. Instead, the focus is on the specific gap identified during the lesson, using concrete resources, precise explanations, and immediate practice opportunities. The goal is not to teach everything, but to address the precise barrier preventing the pupil from keeping up.

### Same-Day Intervention in Primary and Secondary Contexts

While same-day intervention originated in primary settings, the principles apply across key stages. In secondary schools, where teachers often see multiple classes and movement between lessons limits flexibility, implementation requires adaptation.

Some secondary schools have experimented with "maths clinics"—designated daily slots where pupils can access additional support. Others use technology, recording short video explanations that pupils can access immediately after lessons. The key principle—responding swiftly to identified gaps—remains constant, even as the organisational mechanisms vary.

The NCETM (National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics) provides case studies of schools successfully implementing same-day intervention across different contexts. Common factors in successful implementations include: senior leadership commitment to releasing time for intervention; a whole-school culture that normalises additional support rather than stigmatising it; and carefully designed diagnostic tools that enable precise identification of gaps.

## Mastery Approaches: Teaching for Depth

### The Essence of Teaching for Mastery

The mastery approach to mathematics teaching, promoted by the NCETM and Maths Hubs across England, aligns closely with the "keep up" philosophy. Teaching for mastery is built on several core principles that together create a system designed to prevent pupils from falling behind.

The first principle is that the curriculum is cumulative and coherent. Topics are sequenced carefully so that each new concept builds upon secure prior learning. The curriculum is designed to allow sufficient time for every child to access age-appropriate concepts and skills. Rather than racing through content, teachers focus on depth of understanding before breadth.

The second principle is that the whole class moves through the curriculum together. This does not mean that all pupils do identical work—differentiation in mastery classrooms occurs through depth and complexity rather than through acceleration to new content. Pupils who grasp concepts rapidly are challenged through sophisticated problems and extensions of the core concept, not through introduction of new, unrelated material.

The third principle concerns early identification and intervention. The NCETM's "Essence of Maths Teaching for Mastery" explicitly states: "If a pupil fails to grasp a concept or procedure, this is identified quickly and early intervention ensures the pupil is ready to move forward with the whole class in the next lesson." This principle directly enshrines the "keep up" philosophy within the mastery approach.

### Differentiation Through Depth

A common misconception about mastery teaching is that it ignores individual differences between pupils. In fact, mastery approaches accommodate variation through what is called "differentiation by depth" or "difficultization."

Pupils who demonstrate secure understanding of a concept are given opportunities to apply their knowledge in increasingly complex and unfamiliar contexts. They might solve non-routine problems, explain their reasoning in multiple ways, create their own examples, or generalise patterns. These activities deepen understanding without introducing new content that would take them ahead of their peers.

Meanwhile, pupils who need additional support receive it through the early intervention strategies described above. The class moves forward together, but individual pupils' needs are met through the combination of depth activities for rapid graspers and immediate intervention for those who struggle.

This approach contrasts with traditional differentiation through acceleration, where more able pupils are given new content while others consolidate. Such approaches can create ever-widening gaps as the accelerated group moves further ahead. Differentiation by depth, combined with early intervention, seeks to keep the class together while ensuring all pupils make progress.

### The Role of Representation and Structure

Teaching for mastery makes extensive use of concrete and pictorial representations to support understanding. The Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach provides pupils with multiple representations of mathematical concepts, increasing the likelihood that they will grasp ideas securely.

When pupils struggle, teachers can return to representations that make the mathematics visible and manipulable. A pupil who cannot grasp fraction multiplication abstractly may understand it when shown through area models or physical manipulatives. These representations provide alternative pathways to understanding, helping pupils keep up when abstract approaches fail.

The NCETM's Primary Mastery Professional Development materials provide detailed guidance on the representations that support different concepts. Skilled teachers have a repertoire of representations at their disposal and can deploy them responsively when diagnostic assessment reveals gaps.

## Practical Implementation Strategies

### Creating a Culture of Intervention

Implementing "keep up" approaches requires more than technical strategies; it requires cultural change. Schools must create environments where receiving additional support is normalised, not stigmatised.

This cultural work begins with language. Talking about "keeping up" rather than "catching up" positions intervention as a proactive, positive process rather than remedial repair. Discussing gaps as specific and addressable—"you haven't quite secured column addition yet"—rather than as fixed traits—"you're not good at maths"—supports a growth mindset.

Visible timetabling of intervention helps normalise it. When pupils see that intervention groups change regularly, with different pupils accessing support at different times depending on current needs, they understand that intervention is a fluid response to learning, not a permanent label.

Celebrating progress rather than just attainment also supports the culture. When pupils who have received intervention make gains, their progress is acknowledged, reinforcing the message that support leads to success.

### Training and Support for Staff

Effective early intervention requires skilled practitioners. Teachers need training in diagnostic assessment—how to construct and interpret diagnostic questions, how to probe pupil thinking, how to identify the root causes of errors.

Teaching assistants who deliver intervention need specific preparation. The EEF has found that intervention delivered by teaching assistants is most effective when TAs have been trained in the specific approaches being used and when they have regular opportunities to liaise with class teachers about pupil progress.

Maths Hubs provide professional development programmes focused on teaching for mastery, including the development of early intervention strategies. Schools implementing "keep up" approaches should engage with these programmes to ensure staff have the necessary expertise.

### Using Technology

Technology can support early identification and intervention in several ways. Digital assessment tools can provide immediate feedback on pupil responses, flagging misconceptions for teacher attention. Adaptive learning platforms can provide personalised practice, ensuring pupils consolidate foundations before moving forward.

However, technology should complement rather than replace teacher judgment. The most effective use of technology in early intervention is to provide teachers with better data and to give pupils additional practice opportunities, while teachers retain responsibility for diagnosing thinking and planning responsive teaching.

Video technology can support intervention when same-day face-to-face time is logistically impossible. Teachers or teaching assistants can record short explanations of key concepts that pupils can access independently. While less responsive than live intervention, such resources can still address gaps more swiftly than waiting for the next lesson.

### Parental Engagement

Parents and carers play a crucial role in supporting the "keep up" approach. When schools communicate clearly about the importance of secure foundations and the normalcy of receiving additional support, parents can reinforce these messages at home.

Schools should provide guidance on how parents can support their children's mathematical development without inadvertently creating pressure or anxiety. Emphasising the value of practice, patience, and a growth mindset helps parents contribute positively to their children's mathematical journeys.

For pupils receiving intervention, regular communication with parents about progress and next steps ensures home-school alignment. Parents who understand the specific gaps being addressed and the strategies being used can support consolidation between sessions.

## Evidence and Case Studies

### The Education Endowment Foundation Evidence Base

The EEF's Teaching and Learning Toolkit provides valuable evidence on approaches to supporting struggling learners. Mastery learning, as defined by the EEF, has an average effect size of five additional months' progress, with stronger effects in mathematics than in other subjects.

The EEF's guidance report "Improving Mathematics in Key Stages 2 and 3" makes several recommendations relevant to the "keep up" approach. These include: using assessment to build on pupils' existing knowledge and understanding; using manipulatives and representations to expose mathematical structure; and teaching pupils strategies for solving problems.

The EEF's evaluation of the Mathematics Mastery programme found positive impacts on pupil attainment, particularly for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. While effect sizes were modest, the consistency of positive findings across multiple evaluations supports the approach.

### Case Study: Outwood Grange Academies Trust

The Outwood Grange Academies Trust has been a pioneer in same-day intervention. Their model, developed with the Yorkshire and Humber Maths Hub, restructures the mathematics lesson to create space for immediate response to gaps.

Evaluation data from Outwood schools shows that the approach has contributed to narrowing the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers. The trust reports that pupils who receive same-day intervention make accelerated progress, often closing gaps within weeks rather than years.

Key success factors identified by Outwood include: rigorous diagnostic assessment during lessons; carefully planned intervention activities that address specific gaps; and strong organisational systems that enable the 15-minute intervention slot to run smoothly.

### Case Study: Two Mile Ash School

Two Mile Ash School in Milton Keynes has implemented same-day intervention as part of a mastery approach to mathematics. Featured in NCETM case studies, the school has restructured its timetable and deployed staff to enable immediate intervention.

The school's mathematics leader reports that the approach has transformed outcomes for previously struggling pupils. By addressing gaps immediately, before they can accumulate, the school has significantly reduced the number of pupils requiring intensive catch-up programmes.

The school's experience illustrates that same-day intervention is sustainable when embedded within a coherent whole-school approach. The investment in organisational structures pays
