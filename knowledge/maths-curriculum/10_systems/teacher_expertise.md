# Specialist and Non-Specialist Teachers in Mathematics

## Overview

The landscape of mathematics teaching in England is shaped by a persistent tension between the demand for subject specialists and the reality of a teacher workforce that includes significant numbers of non-specialists and those teaching outside their qualification areas. Understanding this context—from the structural causes of teacher shortages to the practical strategies for developing expertise across all practitioners—is essential for school leaders, curriculum designers, and mathematics coordinators seeking to ensure high-quality mathematical education for all pupils.

## The Mathematics Teacher Shortage: Scale and Causes

### Recruitment Challenges

The mathematics teacher shortage in England represents one of the most significant challenges facing the education system. According to the National Audit Office (2025), the Department for Education has missed its target for secondary teacher trainees in nine of the previous ten years, with 13 out of 18 subjects failing to meet recruitment targets in 2024/25. While mathematics has seen improved recruitment recently—2,588 trainees in 2025, a 16% increase on the previous year (The Guardian, 2025)—the historical shortfall has created a persistent deficit in specialist capacity.

The NFER Teacher Labour Market in England Annual Report 2024 reveals that sustained under-recruitment has fed through into declining specialist teaching rates. In mathematics, the proportion of lessons taught by specialists fell from 87% to 85% in 2023, with science declining from 95% to 94% and English from 92% to 91%. These figures mask significant geographical and socio-economic variation: schools in areas outside London with high levels of disadvantage have only 37% of GCSE mathematics teachers holding a mathematics degree (Sibieta, 2018, cited in Springer).

### Retention Pressures

Recruitment difficulties are compounded by retention challenges. The NFER (2024) reports that both recruitment and retention issues are persisting, with the latter made worse by increased teacher workload pressures since the pandemic. Ex-teachers of STEM and non-STEM subjects alike cite workload as the main reason for leaving the profession, suggesting that financial incentives alone are insufficient to address the crisis.

The NFER evaluation of retention payment schemes found that while programmes such as the mathematics and physics retention payment (MPRP) and the mathematics phased bursary (MPB) had previously been considered effective, their impact is smaller than originally estimated (Tes, 2025). This indicates the need for multifaceted approaches that address workload, professional development, and career progression alongside financial incentives.

### Impact on Pupil Outcomes

The consequences of teacher shortages extend beyond staffing difficulties to affect pupil learning. The NFER (2025) reports that to cope with shortages, class sizes are creeping higher, and more unqualified or non-specialist teachers are being used to plug gaps in subjects such as physics and mathematics. This out-of-field teaching—where qualified teachers deliver subjects outside their specialism—represents a particular risk to curriculum quality and pupil progression.

## Defining Subject Specialism in Mathematics

### Qualification Routes and Expectations

Subject specialism in mathematics can be understood through multiple lenses. At the most straightforward level, a specialist mathematics teacher typically holds a degree in mathematics or a closely related discipline (such as physics or engineering) alongside qualified teacher status. However, this definition becomes more nuanced when considering:

- **Initial teacher training pathways**: PGCE, School Direct, Teach First, and undergraduate routes with QTS
- **Subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) courses**: Intensive programmes for trainees with related degrees or career changers
- **Career changers**: Professionals entering teaching from mathematics-rich fields who may lack formal teaching qualifications initially
- **International recruits**: Teachers trained overseas whose qualifications may not map neatly onto UK frameworks

The Teachers' Standards require that teachers demonstrate good subject and curriculum knowledge (Standard 3), but do not specify particular degree requirements. This creates flexibility but also ambiguity in defining what constitutes adequate subject expertise for mathematics teaching.

### The Subject Knowledge Spectrum

Mathematics subject knowledge exists on a spectrum that encompasses:

**Advanced mathematical knowledge**: University-level mathematics including analysis, algebra, topology, and advanced statistics. While not directly taught in schools, this foundational understanding shapes teachers' capacity to explain concepts, make connections, and respond to pupils' questions with confidence.

**School mathematics knowledge**: Deep understanding of the mathematics curriculum from Early Years Foundation Stage through to A-level, including the progression of concepts, common misconceptions, and multiple representations.

**Mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT)**: The specialised knowledge that goes beyond simply knowing the mathematics itself to include understanding how to represent concepts, interpret pupil thinking, and design instruction that builds understanding. This framework, developed by Deborah Ball and colleagues at the University of Michigan, distinguishes between common content knowledge (what any educated adult knows), specialised content knowledge (unique to teaching), and pedagogical content knowledge (how to teach the subject).

### Non-Specialist Teaching: Categories and Contexts

Non-specialist mathematics teaching occurs in several distinct contexts:

**Out-of-field teaching by qualified teachers**: A biology teacher delivering GCSE mathematics classes, a PE teacher covering KS3 mathematics, or a primary teacher without mathematics background leading the subject. These practitioners hold QTS and may be effective teachers, but lack the depth of mathematical study that informs specialist practice.

**Supply and temporary staff**: Short-term cover arrangements that may involve teachers without mathematics qualifications or unqualified instructors.

**Teaching assistants and support staff**: Higher Level Teaching Assistants (HLTAs) and other support staff who deliver interventions, work with small groups, or provide in-class support under teacher direction.

**Early Career Teachers developing specialism**: Teachers in their first years who may be teaching mathematics while still developing their subject expertise through structured programmes.

## The Non-Specialist Challenge: Research and Realities

### Prevalence and Patterns

Research by the NFER and others has documented the scale of out-of-field teaching. The 2023 data showing 15% of mathematics lessons taught by non-specialists represents a significant proportion of pupil learning time. This figure is higher in certain contexts:

- Disadvantaged areas with difficulty attracting specialists
- Smaller schools with limited staffing capacity
- Specific key stages (particularly post-16 where the shortage of qualified mathematics teachers is most acute)
- Particular topics within mathematics (some schools report difficulties staffing further mathematics, mechanics, or decision mathematics modules)

### Subject Knowledge Gaps

Non-specialist teachers may face particular challenges in:

**Mathematical reasoning and proof**: Understanding the logical structures that underpin mathematics and being able to guide pupils through deductive reasoning.

**Making connections across the curriculum**: Recognising how topics link together and building coherent learning journeys that span multiple years.

**Addressing misconceptions**: Anticipating common errors and misunderstandings, understanding their roots, and designing instruction to address them.

**Stretching high-attaining pupils**: Providing enrichment, challenge, and acceleration for pupils who grasp concepts quickly.

**Using precise mathematical language**: Employing accurate terminology and definitions, and supporting pupils to do the same.

### Professional Identity and Confidence

Beyond the technical knowledge gaps, non-specialist teachers may experience:

- Lower confidence in their mathematical abilities, affecting their classroom presence and responsiveness
- Reduced willingness to engage in departmental planning and curriculum development
- Limited participation in mathematics-specific professional communities
- Higher anxiety about inspection, pupil questions, and parental queries
These affective factors can be as significant as knowledge gaps in determining teaching effectiveness.

## Developing Subject Knowledge: Programmes and Pathways

### The NCETM and Maths Hubs

The National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics (NCETM), working through the 40 Maths Hubs across England, provides the primary infrastructure for mathematics-specific professional development. The Maths Hubs Programme, funded by the DfE, offers a range of opportunities for both specialists and non-specialists.

### Specialist Knowledge for Teaching Mathematics (SKTM)

The SKTM programme represents the flagship professional development offer for developing subject knowledge across the teaching workforce. Several SKTM pathways exist:

**SKTM Primary Teachers**: An 18-session programme (equivalent to six full days) for primary teachers seeking to develop their specialist knowledge. The programme focuses on number sense, additive reasoning, multiplicative reasoning, and fractions—core areas that underpin mathematical progression. Participants work in small groups of up to 20, with a common national outline adapted locally by Maths Hubs.

**SKTM Primary Teaching Assistants**: Designed specifically to improve the subject knowledge and pedagogical knowledge of practitioners supporting primary mathematics learning. This programme recognises the critical role that teaching assistants play in mathematics education, particularly in providing intervention and additional support. NCETM features highlight how teaching assistants develop understanding of mathematical structures that enable them to identify and correct misconceptions—for example, understanding place value deeply enough to spot a child's error, or recognising subitising difficulties.

**SKTM Secondary Early Career Teachers**: A one-year programme supporting early career secondary teachers to develop specialist knowledge, underpinned by teaching for mastery principles. This recognises that many secondary mathematics teachers develop their expertise significantly during their first years in the classroom.

**SKTM Secondary Non-Specialist Teachers**: Perhaps the most directly relevant programme for addressing the challenges documented in this article. This programme is fully funded and specifically targets teachers delivering mathematics without a mathematics specialism. The programme covers:
- The structure of the number system
- Operating on number
- Multiplicative reasoning
- Sequences and graphs
- Statistics and probability
- Geometry

All SKTM programmes are fully funded by the Maths Hubs Programme and therefore free to participating schools, removing a significant barrier to access.

### Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) Courses

For those entering the profession, SKE courses provide intensive mathematics study prior to or alongside initial teacher training. These courses:
- Range from 8-week to 36-week programmes depending on prior knowledge
- Are fully funded, with bursaries available
- May be delivered face-to-face, online, or through blended approaches
- Lead to a subject knowledge certificate that supplements teaching qualifications
SKE courses are particularly important for career changers with mathematics-rich professional backgrounds but no formal mathematical qualifications.

### School-Based Development

Beyond national programmes, effective schools implement local strategies:

**Mentoring and coaching**: Pairing non-specialists with experienced mathematics teachers for regular observation, co-planning, and feedback.

**Team teaching**: Structuring timetables to enable non-specialists to work alongside specialists, gradually building confidence and knowledge.

**Departmental professional development**: Using faculty meeting time for mathematical study, not just administrative matters.

**Resources and planning support**: Providing detailed schemes of work, exemplar lessons, and teaching guidance that scaffold non-specialist delivery.

**Communities of practice**: Creating structures—formal and informal—where mathematics teachers at all levels of expertise can share challenges and develop collectively.

## Supporting Structures: Teaching Assistants and Support Staff

### The Role of Teaching Assistants in Mathematics

Teaching assistants play a substantial role in mathematics education, particularly in primary schools and in supporting pupils with additional needs. The deployment of teaching assistants for mathematics intervention and in-class support has increased significantly over recent decades, making their professional development a priority.

Higher Level Teaching Assistants (HLTAs) may have particular expertise in numeracy support. As the HLTA framework explains, HLTAs in primary schools might give support across the curriculum but with particular expertise to support progress in numeracy, literacy, music, or art and design. They use their subject knowledge to offer extra support to students who need it, informed by their understanding of mathematical concepts and common difficulties.

### Professional Development for Support Staff

The NCETM SKTM Primary Teaching Assistants programme is complemented by other opportunities:

- **HLTA preparation programmes**: Level 2 qualifications in mathematics/numeracy are typically required, followed by HLTA assessment preparation
- **Maths-specific training**: Local authority and trust-based training for teaching assistants supporting mathematics
- **Intervention programmes**: Training in specific approaches such as Numbers Count, Success@Arithmetic, or other structured interventions
- **On-the-job learning**: Working alongside specialist teachers, participating in planning and assessment activities

### Effective Deployment

Research on teaching assistant effectiveness suggests that their impact depends significantly on deployment model. The Education Endowment Foundation's Teaching and Learning Toolkit identifies teaching assistants as having moderate positive impact when deployed effectively for specific interventions, but limited or negative impact when used as general classroom support without clear purpose or preparation. For mathematics specifically, this means:
- Training teaching assistants in the specific mathematical content they will support
- Ensuring they understand the progression of learning and common misconceptions
- Using them for structured interventions with clear objectives and assessments
- Avoiding deployment as general classroom support that simply maintains pupil engagement without advancing learning

## Ofsted Expectations and the Education Inspection Framework

### Subject Knowledge in the EIF

The Education Inspection Framework (EIF) places subject knowledge at the heart of quality education. Ofsted inspectors evaluate whether:

- Teachers have expert knowledge of the subjects they teach
- Teachers present subjects clearly and with appropriate precision
- Teachers check learners' understanding systematically and effectively
- The curriculum is coherently planned and sequenced
The 2024 guidance that came into force on 5 September 2024 maintains these expectations, with particular emphasis on how subject knowledge enables teachers to design and deliver effective instruction.

### Mathematics-Specific Inspection Findings

Ofsted's mathematics subject reports provide insight into what inspectors look for and what they find. The latest Ofsted mathematics subject report was generally positive about primary school mathematics teaching, stating that 'Teachers often showed strong subject teaching knowledge' (MEI, 2024). However, the report also identified areas for development, particularly in ensuring that subject knowledge translates into effective pedagogy.

The EIF asks that pupils' mathematical knowledge is developed and used, where appropriate, across the curriculum—emphasising not just knowledge acquisition but application and connection-making.

### Implications for Non-Specialist Teachers

For schools with non-specialist mathematics teachers, Ofsted expectations create pressure but also clarity. Inspectors will evaluate:

- Whether non-specialists have adequate support and development to teach mathematics effectively
- Whether school leadership has identified and is addressing subject knowledge gaps
- Whether curriculum planning and resources compensate for variations in teacher expertise
- Whether pupils' mathematical progression is secure regardless of who teaches them
Schools that can demonstrate systematic approaches to developing teacher expertise—through SKTM programmes, mentoring, quality resources, and careful deployment—are better positioned to meet these expectations even when some mathematics teaching is delivered by non-specialists.

## Systemic Responses: Policy and Strategy

### Government Financial Incentives

The DfE continues to offer substantial financial incentives to attract mathematics teachers. As of December 2025, the government offered financial incentives of up to £31,000 tax-free for talented individuals to train to teach in shortage subjects, alongside expanded Postgraduate Teaching Apprenticeship routes that allow trainees to earn while they train (GOV.UK, 2025).

These incentives include:
- Tax-free bursaries for mathematics trainees
- Scholarships for those with excellent academic records
- Retention payments for early career mathematics teachers
- Targeted incentives for teaching in disadvantaged areas

However, the NFER evaluation suggests that while these incentives improve recruitment, they have limited impact on retention—highlighting the need for broader workplace reforms.

### The Early Career Framework

The Early Career Framework (ECF), introduced nationally in 2021, provides structured support for teachers in their first two years. For mathematics teachers, this includes:
- Subject-specific mentoring where possible
- Focus on developing subject knowledge alongside general pedagogy
- Reduced timetables to allow time for professional learning
- Access to high-quality training materials
The ECF represents recognition that subject expertise develops over time and requires structured support beyond initial training.

### National Professional Qualifications

The NPQ suite includes leadership qualifications, but also the NPQ in Leading Primary Mathematics and other subject-specific pathways. These qualifications support teachers to develop expertise and lead mathematics improvement in their schools.

### Trust-Level Strategies

Multi-academy trusts are increasingly developing their own approaches to the specialist/non-specialist challenge:

- **Central subject teams**: Specialist leads who support schools across the trust
- **Shared resources**: High-quality curriculum materials that support non-specialist delivery
- **Cross-school deployment**: Moving specialist teachers between schools to fill gaps
- **Collaborative professional development**: Trust-wide mathematics networks and development programmes
- **Strategic recruitment**: Using the trust's scale to attract specialists to hard-to-fill posts

## Practical Strategies for Schools

### Audit and Assessment

Schools should begin with honest assessment of their current position:
- Which mathematics lessons are taught by specialists versus non-specialists?
- What are the specific subject knowledge gaps among non-specialist teachers?
- What support structures currently exist?
- What professional development opportunities have teachers accessed?
- What impact is this having on pupil outcomes?

### Prioritising Access to SKTM

Given that SKTM programmes are fully funded, schools should prioritise getting non-specialist teachers and teaching assistants onto appropriate pathways. This requires:
- Identifying eligible staff
- Securing release time (a significant practical barrier)
- Following up to ensure completion and application of learning
- Creating structures for participants to share learning with colleagues

### Mentoring and Support Structures

Effective mentoring relationships between specialists and non-specialists can accelerate development:
- Regular co-planning sessions
- Observation and feedback cycles
- Modelling of expert practice
- Graduated responsibility as confidence grows

### Curriculum Resources as Scaffolds

High-quality curriculum resources can compensate for variations in teacher expertise:
- Detailed schemes of work with pedagogical guidance
- Exemplar lesson sequences
- Common misconception alerts
- Assessment materials with guidance on interpretation
- Manipulative and representation guidance
However, resources alone are insufficient—they must be accompanied by professional development that builds teachers' capacity to use them effectively.

### Creating Mathematics-Focused Professional Cultures

Schools can foster cultures where mathematics expertise is valued and developed:
- Regular mathematics-focused staff meetings
- Cross-phase collaboration (primary-secondary transition work)
- Celebration of mathematical learning
- Engagement with the wider mathematics education community (Maths Hubs, subject associations)
- Visibility of mathematics in school priorities and development planning

## Looking Forward: Challenges and Opportunities

### Persistent Challenges

Despite the programmes and strategies outlined above, significant challenges remain:

**Scale of need versus capacity**: With 15% of mathematics lessons taught by non-specialists and high demand for SKTM places, there is a gap between the professional development required and the capacity to provide it.

**Retention of developed expertise**: Schools invest in developing non-specialists only to lose them to other schools
