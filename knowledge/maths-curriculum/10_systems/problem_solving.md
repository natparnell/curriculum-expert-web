# Problem Solving in Mathematics

## Introduction: The Centrality of Problem Solving

Problem solving stands as one of the three core aims of the National Curriculum for Mathematics in England (DfE, 2013), alongside fluency and reasoning. Yet despite its prominence in policy, Ofsted's subject report *Coordinating Mathematical Success* (2023) found significant variation in how schools approach problem-solving instruction, with many pupils failing to develop the strategic competence necessary for tackling unfamiliar mathematical challenges. This knowledge file examines the research base for teaching problem-solving explicitly, explores the heuristics and strategies that underpin effective mathematical problem-solving, and identifies common weaknesses identified by Ofsted and other researchers.

The teaching of problem solving represents a distinct pedagogical challenge. As Polya (1957) established in his foundational work *How to Solve It*, problem solving is not merely the application of previously learned procedures to familiar situations—it is the process of engaging with unfamiliar challenges where the method to solution is not immediately apparent. This distinction matters profoundly for curriculum design and classroom practice. A pupil who can execute long division accurately has demonstrated procedural fluency; a pupil who can determine *when* to use division within a multi-step word problem has begun to demonstrate problem-solving capability.

## Understanding Problem Solving in the Mathematics Curriculum

### Defining Mathematical Problem Solving

The mathematics education community generally distinguishes between "routine" and "non-routine" problems. Routine problems are those for which the pupil knows a standard procedure or algorithm—calculating the area of a rectangle when given dimensions, for instance. Non-routine problems, by contrast, require the pupil to devise an approach, select from multiple possible strategies, or adapt known methods to novel contexts (Foster, 2023).

The English National Curriculum implicitly recognises this distinction. Its problem-solving aim states that pupils should be able to "solve problems by applying their mathematics to a variety of routine and non-routine problems with increasing sophistication, including breaking down problems into a series of simpler steps and persevering in seeking solutions" (DfE, 2013). The inclusion of "increasing sophistication" signals an expectation that pupils will progress from structured problems with clear solution paths to more open-ended challenges requiring genuine mathematical thinking.

### The Relationship Between Fluency, Reasoning, and Problem Solving

Ofsted's research review (2021) and subsequent subject report (2023) emphasised the interconnected nature of the three curriculum aims. Problem solving does not exist in isolation from fluency and reasoning; rather, each enables and is enabled by the others. A pupil lacking fluency with number facts and procedures will find their working memory overwhelmed when attempting to solve complex problems, as cognitive resources are consumed by basic calculations rather than strategic thinking (Cowan, 2014; National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2014).

Conversely, problem-solving experiences can deepen conceptual understanding and reinforce procedural fluency. When pupils apply their knowledge to meaningful challenges, they develop appreciation for the power and purpose of mathematical techniques. The EEF guidance on metacognition and self-regulated learning (2018) notes that problem-solving contexts often provide the most effective opportunities for pupils to monitor their own thinking, evaluate their progress, and adjust their approach—skills that transfer across mathematical domains and indeed across subject boundaries.

## Teaching Problem Solving Explicitly

### The Case for Explicit Instruction

Ofsted's subject report (2023) made a decisive intervention in long-standing debates about problem-solving pedagogy, stating clearly that "pupils cannot become problem-solvers by imitating the activities of experts." This finding challenges approaches that present pupils with complex problems and expect them to discover solution strategies independently. While such investigative approaches have value in specific contexts, the research evidence consistently supports explicit teaching of problem-solving strategies.

The Education Endowment Foundation (2022) summarised this evidence in guidance on developing problem-solving strategies. Their research found that effective teaching combines explicit modelling of worked examples with gradual release of responsibility to pupils. Teachers who think aloud while solving problems, articulating their decision-making processes and self-monitoring strategies, provide pupils with crucial insight into expert mathematical thinking. This modelling must go beyond simply demonstrating solution steps; it must make visible the metacognitive processes that guide strategy selection, error detection, and approach modification.

### Modelling and Think-Aloud Strategies

The EEF blog on problem-solving (2022) described effective practice observed in Cumbria, where teachers used "think aloud" techniques to model worked examples. In this approach, the teacher verbalises their thinking process: "I'm looking at this problem and I notice there are two unknown quantities. That makes me think I might need to set up an equation or work backwards from the final amount. Let me try working backwards first because I can see the final value clearly..."

Such modelling serves multiple purposes. It demonstrates that problem solving is not linear—that experts try approaches, encounter difficulties, and adjust their thinking. It makes visible the heuristics (general problem-solving strategies) that experts apply semi-automatically. And it introduces pupils to the language of mathematical thinking, providing them with resources for their own self-explanations.

Research by Schoenfeld (1985, 1992) identified metacognition—the monitoring and control of one's own thinking—as a critical factor distinguishing successful from unsuccessful problem solvers. Expert mathematicians continuously ask themselves questions: "What am I doing? Why am I doing it? How is it helping me?" Teaching problem solving explicitly means teaching pupils to ask these questions of themselves, and modelling provides the initial template for this internal dialogue.

### The Gradual Release Model

Effective problem-solving instruction typically follows a gradual release model, sometimes described as "I do, we do, you do":

1. **Teacher modelling** (I do): The teacher solves problems while thinking aloud, demonstrating expert thinking and strategy selection.

2. **Guided practice** (We do): Pupils attempt problems with substantial scaffolding—partially worked examples, strategy prompts, collaborative discussion, and teacher support.

3. **Independent practice** (You do): Pupils solve problems independently, applying learned strategies and developing fluency with problem-solving processes.

Ofsted (2023) found that weaker provision often skipped the modelling phase entirely, presenting pupils with problems and expecting independent discovery. Stronger provision invested significant time in the "I do" and "we do" phases, ensuring pupils had well-developed schemas for problem-solving before independent application was expected.

## Heuristics and Strategies for Mathematical Problem Solving

### Polya's Four-Step Framework

George Polya's *How to Solve It* (1945) established the foundational framework for teaching mathematical problem solving. His four-step model—**Understand the Problem, Devise a Plan, Carry Out the Plan, and Look Back**—provides a structure for approaching any mathematical problem. While deceptively simple, this framework has proven remarkably durable and influential, informing problem-solving instruction across the world.

Each step contains specific prompts and questions that guide thinking:

**Understand the Problem:** What is the unknown? What are the data? What is the condition? Is it possible to satisfy the condition? Is the condition sufficient to determine the unknown? Or is it insufficient? Or redundant? Or contradictory? Can you draw a figure? Do you know a related problem?

**Devise a Plan:** Do you know a related problem? Do you know a theorem that could be useful? Look at the unknown! Try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown. Here is a problem related to yours and solved before. Could you use it? Could you use its result? Could you use its method?

**Carry Out the Plan:** Carrying out your plan of the solution, check each step. Can you see clearly that the step is correct? Can you prove that it is correct?

**Look Back:** Can you check the result? Can you check the argument? Can you derive the solution differently? Can you see it at a glance? Can you use the result, or the method, for some other problem?

### Core Heuristics for Mathematics

Polya's work established the concept of heuristics—general strategies that guide problem-solving without guaranteeing success. These differ from algorithms, which are guaranteed to produce correct solutions when applied correctly. Heuristics are more flexible but require judgement about when and how to apply them. Key heuristics for school mathematics include:

#### Working Backwards

Working backwards involves starting from the desired outcome and reasoning toward the given information. This heuristic is particularly powerful for problems involving sequences of operations or missing starting values. For example, in problems of the form "I think of a number, multiply it by 3, add 5, and get 26. What number did I think of?" working backwards from 26 (subtract 5, then divide by 3) provides the most efficient solution path.

Research has shown that pupils often struggle to recognise when working backwards is appropriate, tending instead to approach all problems in a forward direction (Stacey & Grose, 2021). Explicit teaching should include clear modelling of this strategy and discussion of the problem features that signal its applicability.

#### Guess and Check

Guess and check (sometimes called trial and improvement) involves making reasoned guesses at solutions and systematically refining them based on feedback. This heuristic develops number sense and approximation skills while providing an entry point for pupils who may not see a direct algebraic solution. In upper primary and secondary mathematics, systematic trial and improvement remains a valid approach for solving equations where algebraic methods may be inefficient or beyond current knowledge.

Effective use of guess and check involves refinement toward efficiency—pupils should progress from random guessing to systematic approaches that narrow the solution space based on feedback from previous attempts.

#### Drawing Diagrams

Visual representation is among the most powerful problem-solving heuristics. Ofsted (2023) noted that pupils who automatically represent problems diagrammatically are often more successful than those who rely solely on symbolic or verbal processing. Bar modelling, derived from Singapore mathematics pedagogy, provides a structured approach to visual representation that is particularly effective for arithmetic word problems and early algebra.

The EEF (2022) highlighted heuristic "checklists" that prompt pupils to consider visual representation as one option among several. Such prompts are especially valuable for pupils who have not yet internalised the habit of visualising mathematical relationships.

#### Looking for Patterns

Pattern recognition underlies much of mathematical reasoning. The heuristic of systematically examining cases to identify patterns is foundational to algebraic thinking, as pupils learn to express general rules from specific instances. Effective pattern-seeking involves organising information systematically (often in tables or lists) to reveal structure that might otherwise remain hidden.

#### Dividing Problems into Smaller Parts

Decomposition—breaking complex problems into manageable sub-problems—is essential for tackling sophisticated mathematical challenges. The National Curriculum explicitly references this skill, stating that pupils should solve problems "including breaking down problems into a series of simpler steps" (DfE, 2013).

Teaching decomposition involves modelling how to identify sub-goals, solve component problems, and combine partial solutions into complete answers. This connects to the broader mathematical practice of structuring complex reasoning into logical sequences.

#### Solving Simpler Related Problems

When faced with an intractable problem, mathematicians often consider simpler cases that preserve essential structure. Pupils can be taught to pose questions like "What if the numbers were smaller?" or "What if there were only two cases instead of ten?" This heuristic connects to Polya's "auxiliary problem" concept and develops the mathematical habit of seeking insight through controlled simplification.

### Strategy Keys and Heuristic Checklists

Research by Foster (2023) and others has explored the use of "strategy keys" or heuristic checklists to support pupil problem solving. These tools provide prompts that guide pupils to consider different heuristics without prescribing specific approaches. For example, a strategy key might list: "Can you draw it? Can you work backwards? Can you find a pattern? Can you try a simpler case?"

The EEF (2022) described heuristic checklists used in Cumbria schools, where pupils were taught to systematically consider different approaches before diving into calculation. Such tools are particularly valuable for developing independence in pupils who might otherwise become stuck or apply inappropriate procedures.

However, research cautions that heuristics must be taught with attention to when and why they apply, not simply as a menu of options. Pupils need to understand the structure of problems that make particular heuristics appropriate, developing conditional knowledge alongside procedural knowledge.

## Common Weaknesses in Problem-Solving Provision

### Weakness 1: Insufficient Fluency Before Problem-Solving Demands

Ofsted's research review (2021) established that "pupils should be fluent in all of the relevant skills before they apply them to problem-solving." This finding contradicted approaches that used problem-solving as the primary vehicle for developing procedural fluency. While problem-solving contexts can motivate learning and deepen understanding, attempting complex problems without adequate fluency places excessive demands on working memory.

Cognitive load theory (Sweller, 2011; Sweller et al., 2019) explains this phenomenon: when working memory is consumed by basic calculations or procedures, insufficient capacity remains for the higher-order thinking required by problem solving. Pupils who have not automated number bonds, multiplication tables, or basic procedures will struggle to allocate attention to problem structure and strategy selection.

Strong provision, as identified by Ofsted (2023), invested significantly in building fluency before demanding sophisticated problem-solving application. This sequencing is not a matter of delaying challenge but of ensuring pupils have the cognitive resources to engage with genuine problem-solving demands.

### Weakness 2: Pseudo-Problem-Solving and Excessive Scaffolding

Ofsted identified a prevalent issue where what appeared to be problem-solving was in fact "procedural variation"—applying recently taught procedures to worded contexts without genuine problem-solving demand. In such cases, pupils knew which operation to apply based on the lesson context or surface features of the question, rather than needing to analyse problem structure and devise an approach.

Similarly, excessive scaffolding can prevent the development of genuine problem-solving capability. When pupils are always told which strategy to use, or when problems are so heavily structured that solution paths are obvious, pupils fail to develop the judgement required for independent problem solving. The goal is "supported independence"—sufficient scaffolding to enable success, but not so much that pupils fail to engage with authentic problem-solving demands.

### Weakness 3: Failure to Teach Strategies Explicitly

Perhaps the most significant weakness identified by Ofsted (2023) was the assumption that problem-solving capability develops through exposure rather than explicit instruction. Many schools presented pupils with problems and expected them to discover effective strategies independently. This approach, while well-intentioned, does not align with research evidence about how expertise develops.

Effective problem solvers possess rich schemas of problem types and corresponding strategies, developed through explicit instruction, modelling, and deliberate practice (Ericsson et al., 1993; Hattie, 2009). Expecting pupils to discover these schemas independently places excessive demands on novices and disadvantages pupils with less prior knowledge or mathematical experience at home.

### Weakness 4: Inadequate Attention to Metacognition

Schoenfeld's research (1985, 1992) demonstrated that successful problem solving depends not only on mathematical knowledge and heuristics but on metacognitive monitoring—the ability to track one's own thinking, evaluate progress, and adjust approach. Novice problem solvers often persist with ineffective strategies, fail to verify their solutions, or miss opportunities to apply appropriate heuristics.

Weak provision often focused solely on solution steps without developing pupils' awareness of their own thinking. Strong provision, by contrast, explicitly taught metacognitive strategies: asking "What am I doing? Why am I doing it? How will it help?" at key decision points; monitoring time allocation and switching strategies when stuck; and checking solutions through alternative methods or estimation.

### Weakness 5: Limited Range of Problem Types

Some curriculum provision exposed pupils only to a narrow range of problem types, often those most directly connected to recently taught procedures. This limited exposure prevented pupils from developing the flexibility required for non-routine problems. Ofsted (2023) noted that stronger provision included "interleaving"—mixing problem types so that pupils had to identify appropriate strategies rather than relying on lesson context cues.

Research on interleaving (Rohrer et al., 2015) confirms that mixing problem types, while initially more challenging for pupils, produces superior long-term learning and transfer. Pupils who have practised identifying appropriate strategies from a varied set of problems are better prepared for novel challenges than those who have practised only single-strategy application.

## Developing Problem-Solving Capability Across Key Stages

### Early Years and Key Stage 1

In the Early Years Foundation Stage, problem-solving foundations are laid through exploratory play and practical challenges. The statutory framework expects children to "develop their ideas about how to solve problems" through activities involving number, shape, space, and measures (DfE, 2021). While formal heuristics are not appropriate at this stage, practitioners can model problem-solving language and thinking: "I wonder how we could find out? What could we try first?"

In Key Stage 1, pupils begin to encounter more structured problems and can be introduced to simple heuristics: drawing pictures, acting out problems, using concrete materials, and working systematically. The focus is on developing positive dispositions toward problem solving—willingness to try, persistence when stuck, and confidence in multiple solution approaches.

### Key Stage 2

Key Stage 2 represents a critical period for developing problem-solving capability. Pupils encounter multi-step problems, begin working with larger numbers and more complex structures, and develop the cognitive capacity for more sophisticated heuristics. Bar modelling and other visual representations can be systematically taught, providing pupils with powerful tools for analysing word problems.

The statutory mathematics curriculum at Key Stage 2 explicitly requires pupils to solve problems involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division; fractions, decimals, and percentages; measurement; and geometry. The problem-solving aim should be integrated across these content domains rather than treated as a separate strand.

### Key Stage 3 and 4

At Key Stage 3, pupils encounter algebra, more complex geometry, and increasingly abstract mathematical concepts. Problem-solving demands correspondingly increase, with pupils expected to tackle non-routine problems requiring the integration of multiple mathematical domains. The GCSE mathematics specification (DfE, 2015) requires pupils to solve problems "in context" and within "unstructured" settings, with approximately 30% of assessment marks awarded for problem-solving and reasoning.

Teaching at this phase must ensure pupils have developed robust heuristics and metacognitive strategies. The range of possible approaches expands significantly, and pupils need well-developed conditional knowledge to select appropriate strategies. The RUDE mnemonic (Read, Underline, Draw, Estimate) and similar structured approaches can provide scaffolds for pupils who have not yet internalised systematic problem-solving habits.

## Assessment of Problem Solving

### Challenges in Assessing Problem-Solving Capability

Assessing problem solving presents particular challenges. Unlike procedural fluency, which can be evaluated through standardised tests of isolated skills, problem-solving competence involves integrating knowledge, selecting appropriate strategies, and persisting through difficulty. Traditional assessments may capture only the final answer, missing the crucial processes that distinguish expert from novice problem solvers.

Ofsted (2023) noted that stronger schools used a range of assessment approaches: analysing pupils' written work for evidence of strategy selection and self-monitoring; observing pupils as they worked to understand their thinking processes; and engaging pupils in discussions where they explained their reasoning. These approaches provide richer information about problem-solving development than answer-only assessment.

### Formative Assessment Strategies

Formative assessment of problem solving focuses on identifying where pupils are in their development and providing feedback that supports progress. Teachers might assess:

- Whether pupils can identify what a problem is asking
- Whether pupils select appropriate heuristics for problem structure
- Whether pupils monitor their progress and adjust when stuck
- Whether pupils verify their solutions and consider alternative approaches

The EEF (2018) guidance on feedback emphasises that formative assessment is most effective when it provides specific guidance on how to improve, rather than simply indicating whether answers are correct. In problem-solving contexts, this might involve prompting pupils to consider alternative heuristics, to check their work using a different method, or to reflect on whether their answer is reasonable.

## Conclusion

Teaching problem solving in mathematics requires explicit attention to strategies, heuristics, and metacognitive processes. Ofsted's research and the broader evidence base make clear that problem-solving capability does not develop through exposure alone but through systematic instruction that makes expert thinking visible and provides structured opportunities for pupils to develop and apply problem-solving schemas.

Key implications for curriculum leaders and teachers include:

1. **Explicitly teach problem-solving strategies**, using modelling and think-aloud techniques to make expert thinking visible.

2. **Ensure adequate fluency** before demanding complex problem-solving application, recognising the cognitive load implications of attempting problems without automated procedures.

3. **Develop pupils' metacognitive awareness**, teaching them to monitor their thinking, evaluate progress, and adjust approach.

4. **Provide varied problem-solving experiences** that require pupils to identify appropriate strategies rather than relying on lesson context cues.

5. **Use gradual release models** that move from teacher modelling through guided practice to independent application.

By attending to these principles, schools can develop pupils who are not merely proficient in mathematical procedures but capable of applying their knowledge flexibly to unfamiliar challenges—the ultimate goal of problem-solving instruction.
