# Bar Modelling: The Singapore Approach to Problem Representation

## Introduction

Bar modelling is a powerful visual problem-solving strategy that originated in Singapore and has become a cornerstone of the teaching for mastery approach in mathematics education. The method uses rectangular bars to represent known and unknown quantities in mathematical problems, making abstract relationships visible and accessible to learners. NCETM (National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics) identifies the bar model as an essential tool that helps children "see" mathematical structure rather than simply following procedural steps.

The bar model is not a method for solving problems per se, but rather a way of revealing the mathematical structure within a problem and gaining insight and clarity to help students decide which operations to use. By converting word problems into visual representations, bar models expose the underlying mathematical relationships that might otherwise remain hidden in dense text.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Jerome Bruner and the CPA Approach

The bar model method draws directly on the Concrete, Pictorial, Abstract (CPA) approach, which has its roots in the work of American psychologist Jerome Bruner. In the late 1960s, Bruner proposed three "modes of representation" that describe how humans develop understanding:

1. **Enactive representation** (action-based): Learning through physical manipulation of objects
2. **Iconic representation** (image-based): Learning through visual representations and pictures
3. **Symbolic representation** (language-based): Learning through abstract symbols and language

Bruner argued that the abstract nature of mathematics is often a "mystery" to many children and therefore needs careful scaffolding through effective representations. The CPA approach captures this progression, moving learners from handling physical objects (concrete), to drawing pictorial representations (pictorial), to working with abstract symbols (abstract).

The bar model sits firmly in the iconic/pictorial phase, acting as a crucial bridge between the concrete manipulation of physical resources and the abstract manipulation of numbers and symbols. As pupils develop fluency with bar models, they gradually internalise the visual representation and can eventually work with abstract rectangles that illustrate problems without needing to draw every individual unit.

### Why Bar Modelling Works

Research in mathematics education consistently demonstrates that visual representations support deeper conceptual understanding. The bar model is particularly effective because it:

- **Makes relationships explicit**: The relative lengths of bars immediately show which quantities are larger or smaller
- **Supports working memory**: By offloading information onto the diagram, pupils can focus on mathematical relationships rather than holding all details in mind
- **Encourages mathematical talk**: The visual representation provides a shared reference point for classroom discussion
- **Develops number sense**: Converting real-life word problems into visual mathematical forms helps students develop deeper understanding of quantities and their relationships
- **Builds algebraic thinking**: The bar model introduces pre-algebraic concepts of representing unknowns visually, laying foundations for formal algebra

## Types of Bar Models

### Part-Whole Models

The part-whole bar model represents a whole amount divided into two or more parts. This model is fundamental for developing understanding of addition and subtraction as inverse operations.

**Structure**: A longer bar representing the whole is shown with dividing lines creating smaller sections for the parts. This makes visually apparent that the parts combine to form the whole.

**Applications**:
- Addition: Combining two or more parts to find the whole
- Subtraction: Finding a missing part when the whole and another part are known
- Aggregation problems: "Tom has 24 apples and gives away 15. How many does he have left?"

The part-whole model helps pupils understand that subtraction is not simply "taking away" but can also mean finding the difference between a whole and one of its constituent parts. This conceptual flexibility is essential for developing robust number sense.

### Comparison Models

Comparison bar models are used when problems involve comparing two or more quantities to find the difference or relationship between them. These models are particularly powerful for solving what many pupils find the most challenging types of word problems.

**Structure**: Two or more parallel bars of different lengths, with the difference clearly marked. The relative lengths immediately communicate which quantity is larger.

**Applications**:
- Finding differences: "Amy has 47 stickers and Ben has 32. How many more does Amy have?"
- Multiplicative comparison: "Sarah has 4 times as many books as Tom. If Tom has 8 books, how many does Sarah have?"
- Complex comparisons involving multiple relationships

Research indicates that comparison problems are frequently where pupils struggle most, often because they cannot visualise the relationships described in the text. The comparison bar model makes these relationships concrete and discussible.

### Multiplication and Division Models

Bar models extend naturally to represent multiplicative relationships. When pupils understand that multiplication represents equal groups, bars can represent either the number of groups or the size of each group.

**Equal groups structure**: A bar divided into equal segments, with each segment representing one group. This connects directly to the array and area models of multiplication.

**Scaling structure**: A bar representing a quantity is shown alongside a longer or shorter bar representing a scaled version (e.g., 3 times as long, half as long).

For division, the bar model helps pupils distinguish between:
- **Grouping/quotitive division**: "How many groups of 4 can I make from 24?" (represented by dividing a bar into equal groups)
- **Sharing/partitive division**: "Share 24 equally among 4 people" (represented by partitioning a bar into 4 equal parts)

This distinction is crucial for developing a full understanding of division and supports later work with fractions and ratio.

### Fraction, Ratio, and Proportion Models

Bar models are exceptionally powerful for representing fractions, ratios, and proportional relationships. The bar naturally represents the whole, with divisions showing fractional parts.

**Fraction representation**: A bar divided into equal parts with some parts shaded or labelled to represent the fraction. This supports understanding of:
- Unit fractions and non-unit fractions
- Equivalent fractions (by subdividing the same bar differently)
- Fractions greater than one

**Ratio representation**: When two or more bars are divided according to a ratio, pupils can see the proportional relationship visually. For example, a ratio of 2:3 can be shown with one bar divided into 2 equal parts and another into 3 equal parts of the same size.

**Percentage representation**: The bar can represent 100%, with sections showing different percentages. This is particularly useful for percentage change problems and reverse percentage questions.

NCETM secondary mastery materials use the percentage bar extensively, building from concrete contexts (like computer download bars) to abstract percentage calculations including finding a percentage of an amount, percentage reduction, reverse percentage problems, and expressing one amount as a percentage of another.

## Progression Across Key Stages

### Early Years and Key Stage 1

The foundations of bar modelling are laid in Early Years through the use of concrete materials and simple pictorial representations. Five-year-olds might use counters or cubes to represent quantities before drawing simple rectangular outlines.

NCETM Primary Professional Development Materials introduce bar models in Year 1, but this introduction is embedded within a carefully sequenced learning journey. Before encountering bar models, pupils will have extensive experience with:

- **Concrete resources**: Counters, cubes, tens frames, bead strings
- **Real-world contexts**: Stories and situations that involve quantities
- **Simple drawings**: Pictorial representations of objects

In Year 1 and 2, bar models are introduced as part-whole models for addition and subtraction within 20, then extending to within 100. The rectangles are drawn proportionally, with longer bars representing larger numbers. At this stage, pupils might use squared paper or pre-drawn bar outlines to support accuracy.

The progression in Key Stage 1 focuses on:
- Understanding that the bar represents a quantity
- Recognising that parts combine to make a whole
- Using comparison language (more than, less than, difference)
- Drawing simple bar models to represent word problems

### Key Stage 2

In Key Stage 2, bar modelling develops significantly in complexity and application. Pupils move from drawing bars with individual units marked to drawing bars that represent quantities abstractly.

**Year 3-4 progression**:
- Multiplication and division bar models
- Introduction to comparison models for larger numbers
- Using bars to represent two-step problems
- Connecting bar models to formal written methods

**Year 5-6 progression**:
- Fraction bar models (unit and non-unit fractions)
- Ratio represented through bar models
- Percentage bars
- Using bar models to solve complex multi-step problems
- Introduction to algebraic thinking through representing unknowns with question marks or letters

By the end of Key Stage 2, pupils should be fluent in selecting appropriate bar model types for different problem structures and using them to solve problems involving all four operations, fractions, and simple ratios.

### Key Stage 3 and Beyond

At secondary level, bar models continue to support mathematical reasoning, particularly in developing proportional thinking and algebraic understanding. NCETM Secondary Mastery Professional Development Materials include extensive work with bar models and double number lines to support reasoning and problem solving.

**Key Stage 3 applications**:
- Representing ratio and proportion problems
- Solving problems involving percentages and percentage change
- Introducing algebraic notation through bar models (where a bar might represent an unknown quantity x)
- Supporting understanding of linear relationships

The bar model acts as a consistent representational tool that spans primary and secondary education, providing continuity for learners as they encounter increasingly complex mathematics.

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Introducing Bar Models

Effective introduction of bar modelling requires careful attention to the CPA progression:

1. **Concrete phase**: Pupils handle physical objects (counters, cubes, Cuisenaire rods) and arrange them in linear patterns that prefigure the bar model.

2. **Pictorial phase**: Pupils draw rectangles to represent the concrete arrangement, initially with individual units marked, progressing to continuous bars.

3. **Abstract phase**: Pupils use bar models as a stepping stone to abstract calculations, eventually internalising the representation.

Teachers should model the drawing of bar models explicitly, using consistent conventions (drawing the whole first for part-whole models, drawing bars parallel for comparison models). Thinking aloud while drawing helps pupils understand the decision-making process.

### Common Misconceptions and How to Address Them

Pupils often develop predictable misconceptions when learning bar modelling:

**Misconception 1: Drawing bars that are not proportional**
Some pupils draw bars of similar length regardless of the quantities they represent, losing the visual representation of magnitude. Address this by asking: "Which quantity is larger? Should this bar be longer or shorter?"

**Misconception 2: Confusing part-whole and comparison models**
Pupils may use a part-whole model when a comparison model is needed, or vice versa. Explicit teaching of problem structures and careful analysis of the question wording helps address this.

**Misconception 3: Treating the bar model as decoration**
Some pupils draw a bar model but then solve the problem using unrelated calculations. Emphasise that the bar model should reveal the calculation needed.

**Misconception 4: Difficulty with unknowns**
Pupils may struggle to represent unknown quantities. Using question marks, boxes, or eventually letters within the bar helps develop algebraic thinking.

**Misconception 5: Over-reliance on bar models**
While powerful, bar models are not always the most efficient strategy. As pupils develop fluency, they should learn to select bar models strategically for problems where they provide particular insight.

### Developing Mathematical Talk

Bar models are powerful tools for developing classroom dialogue. Teachers can use prompts such as:

- "What does this bar represent?"
- "What do we know? What are we trying to find out?"
- "What is the same and what is different about these two bars?"
- "How does the bar model help us decide which operation to use?"
- "Could we represent this problem differently?"

The bar model provides a shared visual reference that supports pupils in explaining their thinking and listening to the reasoning of others.

### Differentiation Strategies

Bar models are inherently adaptable for learners at different stages:

**Support for struggling learners**:
- Pre-drawn bar outlines on squared paper
- Using physical bars (Cuisenaire rods, strips of paper) before drawing
- Starting with smaller numbers
- Focus on one model type at a time

**Challenge for advanced learners**:
- Complex multi-step problems requiring multiple bar models
- Problems with multiple unknowns
- Using bar models to derive algebraic expressions
- Creating problems to fit given bar models

## Integration with the Wider Curriculum

### Connection to Teaching for Mastery

Bar modelling is a central component of teaching for mastery, aligned with the NCETM's Five Big Ideas:

1. **Coherence**: Bar models provide a consistent representational approach across topics and year groups
2. **Representation and Structure**: Bar models make mathematical structure visible
3. **Mathematical Thinking**: Bar models support reasoning and problem-solving
4. **Fluency**: Bar models develop flexibility in moving between representations
5. **Variation**: Bar models help pupils attend to what changes and what stays the same

### Assessment

Bar models can be used formatively to assess understanding:
- Can pupils select an appropriate bar model for a given problem?
- Can pupils draw accurate bar models that represent the problem structure?
- Can pupils explain what their bar model shows?
- Can pupils use bar models to solve problems independently?

NCETM's KS3 subject knowledge audits include bar modelling as one of the core concepts teachers should understand, with exemplifications and explanations provided for professional development.

### Cross-Curricular Applications

While primarily a mathematical tool, bar models support problem-solving in other subjects:

- **Science**: Representing quantities in physics calculations, proportions in chemistry
- **Geography**: Representing population data, comparing statistics
- **Computing**: Understanding algorithms and data structures
- **Economics/Business**: Representing financial data, profit/loss calculations

## Practical Implementation

### Classroom Resources

Effective bar modelling requires appropriate resources:

- **Concrete materials**: Cuisenaire rods, strip diagrams on card, physical bars
- **Squared paper**: Supports accurate proportional drawing
- **Bar model templates**: Pre-drawn outlines for pupils who need support
- **Interactive whiteboard tools**: Digital bar models for whole-class teaching
- **Textbooks and workbooks**: Maths — No Problem! and other Singapore-influenced resources provide extensive bar model practice

### Professional Development

Teachers developing their use of bar modelling benefit from:

- **NCETM Professional Development Materials**: Comprehensive guidance on introducing and developing bar modelling across primary years
- **Subject knowledge enhancement**: Understanding the mathematical structures that bar models reveal
- **Lesson study**: Collaborative planning and observation of bar model lessons
- **Moderation activities**: Comparing how different pupils represent the same problem

### Planning Considerations

When planning to teach with bar models:

1. **Identify the problem structure**: Is this part-whole, comparison, or multiplicative?
2. **Consider prerequisites**: What concrete experience do pupils need first?
3. **Plan the progression**: How will you move from guided to independent use?
4. **Anticipate misconceptions**: What errors are pupils likely to make?
5. **Plan the dialogue**: What mathematical talk will you encourage?

## Conclusion

Bar modelling represents a significant pedagogical tool that transforms how pupils approach mathematical problems. By making abstract relationships visible and concrete, bar models support deep conceptual understanding, develop mathematical reasoning, and provide a consistent approach that spans the entire school curriculum.

The Singapore approach, now embedded in UK teaching for mastery, demonstrates that mathematical achievement is not solely about memorising procedures but about developing the ability to see structure, reason mathematically, and solve problems flexibly. Bar modelling is a powerful vehicle for developing these capabilities in every learner.

For teachers, investing time in teaching bar modelling systematically across the school yields significant returns in pupils' mathematical confidence and achievement. The approach is not a quick fix but a fundamental shift in how we represent mathematical relationships to learners—a shift that pays dividends across all areas of mathematics and into pupils' future learning.
