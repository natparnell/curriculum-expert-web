# Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) Approach to Mathematics Teaching

## Introduction and Overview

The Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach represents one of the most significant pedagogical developments in mathematics education over the past four decades. This three-stage instructional framework, originally developed by American psychologist Jerome Bruner in the 1960s and later refined through the Singapore mathematics education system, has become the cornerstone of teaching for mastery in primary and secondary schools across England, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.

At its essence, the CPA approach recognises that mathematical understanding develops progressively through distinct but interconnected stages of representation. Pupils are introduced to new concepts through hands-on experiences with physical objects (concrete), transition to visual representations and diagrams (pictorial), and ultimately work with symbolic notation and formal mathematical language (abstract). This sequenced progression ensures that pupils build deep, secure understanding rather than merely memorising procedures.

The approach has gained significant traction in English schools since the introduction of the 2014 National Curriculum and has been explicitly endorsed by Ofsted as a feature of effective mathematics teaching. The Ofsted subject report "Coordinating Mathematical Success" (2023) emphasised that developing deep understanding of core number concepts requires consistent use of the CPA approach, with particular attention to understanding number facts and committing them to long-term memory.

## Theoretical Foundations: Jerome Bruner's Work

### Bruner's Modes of Representation

Jerome Bruner, an influential American psychologist and educational theorist, proposed in his 1966 work "Toward a Theory of Instruction" that human cognition develops through three distinct modes of representation: enactive (action-based), iconic (image-based), and symbolic (language-based). The CPA approach directly translates these theoretical insights into classroom practice.

The **enactive mode** corresponds to the concrete stage, where learners engage with physical objects and perform actions that embody mathematical relationships. Bruner argued that all learning begins with physical interaction with the environment, and this remains true even for sophisticated mathematical concepts. When pupils use Dienes blocks to model place value or combine physical objects to understand addition, they are operating in the enactive mode.

The **iconic mode** aligns with the pictorial stage, where learners work with visual representations that stand for the physical objects they have previously manipulated. These representations capture the essential mathematical structure while removing the physicality of concrete materials. Bar models, part-whole diagrams, and number lines all function as iconic representations that help pupils visualise mathematical relationships.

The **symbolic mode** corresponds to the abstract stage, where learners work with conventional mathematical notation, numerals, and formal language. This is the most efficient form of representation but, crucially in Bruner's view, cannot be successfully accessed without first establishing understanding through enactive and iconic experiences.

### The Spiral Curriculum

Bruner's concept of the spiral curriculum is equally important for understanding the CPA approach. He argued that any subject can be taught effectively in some intellectually honest form to any child at any stage of development. This means that complex mathematical ideas can be introduced concretely to young children and then revisited at increasing levels of abstraction as pupils mature.

In practice, this means that the CPA approach is not a one-way street from concrete to abstract. Rather, teachers should be prepared to move fluidly between representations, often returning to concrete materials even when working with abstract concepts. A Year 6 pupil struggling with algebraic notation might benefit from revisiting concrete or pictorial representations, and this is entirely consistent with the CPA philosophy.

## The Concrete Stage: Learning Through Manipulation

### Principles of Effective Concrete Experiences

The concrete stage is where pupils first encounter new mathematical concepts through direct interaction with physical objects. This stage is fundamental because it grounds abstract mathematical ideas in sensory-motor experience. When pupils handle objects, they develop an intuitive sense of mathematical relationships that forms the foundation for later abstract understanding.

Effective concrete experiences share several key characteristics. First, they must be **mathematically meaningful**—the physical actions pupils perform should directly embody the mathematical structure being learned. Simply handling objects is insufficient; pupils must engage in activities that make mathematical relationships visible and tangible.

Second, concrete experiences should be **varied and multiple**. Pupils benefit from encountering the same concept through different physical representations. Understanding place value, for instance, is deepened when pupils have used Dienes blocks, place value counters, bead strings, and number frames (Numicon) rather than just one type of manipulative.

Third, concrete experiences must be **discursive**. Pupils should be encouraged to describe what they are doing, explain their thinking, and connect their physical actions to mathematical language. This verbalisation helps bridge the gap between physical experience and formal understanding.

### Key Manipulatives and Their Uses

**Dienes Base 10 Blocks** (also known as Base 10 apparatus) are perhaps the most widely used mathematical manipulatives in English primary schools. Named after Hungarian mathematician Zoltán Pál Dienes, these blocks provide a proportional representation of the base-ten number system. Units are represented by small cubes, tens by rods of ten cubes joined together, hundreds by ten-by-ten squares, and thousands by ten-by-ten-by-ten cubes. The proportional nature of these materials helps pupils visualise the relationships between place values and understand why we "exchange" ten units for one ten or vice versa.

**Numicon** is a system of plastic shapes, each representing a number from 1 to 10, with holes arranged in patterns that make number relationships visible. Developed in the United Kingdom and now published by Oxford University Press, Numicon is particularly effective for developing number sense in early years and Key Stage 1. The physical shapes allow pupils to see that numbers can be composed and decomposed, supporting understanding of addition, subtraction, and later multiplication and division.

**Place Value Counters** are flat, circular discs marked with values (typically 1, 10, 100, 1000, and sometimes decimals). Unlike Dienes blocks, these counters are not proportional— a counter marked "100" is the same size as one marked "1." This abstraction makes them more suitable for older pupils who have already grasped the proportional relationships through earlier work with Dienes blocks. Place value counters scale effectively to larger numbers and decimals, making them valuable throughout Key Stage 2.

**Cuisenaire Rods** are a set of ten rods of different lengths and colours, each representing a different number from 1 (white cube) to 10 (orange rod). Developed by Belgian primary school teacher Georges Cuisenaire, these rods are particularly powerful for exploring number relationships, equivalence, and the structure of the four operations. Because the rods do not have markings, pupils must rely on their relative lengths, which encourages attention to relationships rather than counting.

**Bead Strings and Rekenreks** are counting frames that support the development of mental calculation strategies. The rekenrek (literally "counting rack" in Dutch) typically features two rows of ten beads, grouped in fives by colour. This structure encourages pupils to see numbers in relation to five and ten, supporting the development of efficient mental strategies based on these benchmark numbers.

### Common Misconceptions at the Concrete Stage

Pupils often develop misconceptions during concrete experiences if these are not carefully structured. One common issue is **procedural without conceptual understanding**—pupils learn to manipulate materials to get answers without understanding the mathematical relationships involved. For example, a pupil might learn to exchange ten unit cubes for one ten rod without understanding why this represents the same quantity.

Another misconception is **over-reliance on counting**. When pupils count individual objects rather than recognising groups, they miss opportunities to develop more efficient strategies. Teachers should encourage pupils to "see" quantities without counting (subitising) and to work with groups rather than individual items.

**Difficulty transitioning** from concrete to other representations is also common. Some pupils become so attached to physical manipulatives that they struggle to work with pictures or symbols. Teachers must deliberately build bridges between representations, often by using concrete and pictorial alongside each other before gradually reducing the concrete component.

## The Pictorial Stage: Visualising Mathematical Structure

### Functions of Pictorial Representation

The pictorial stage serves multiple essential functions in mathematical learning. First, it provides a **bridge between concrete experience and abstract symbol manipulation**. When pupils draw or interpret diagrams that represent the concrete materials they have used, they begin to internalise the mathematical structure and reduce their dependence on physical objects.

Second, pictorial representations make mathematical relationships **visible and discussible**. Diagrams allow pupils to point to specific elements, trace connections, and explain their reasoning in ways that are difficult with abstract symbols alone. This visibility supports collaborative learning and whole-class discussion.

Third, pictorial representations are **portable and flexible**. Unlike concrete materials, which are limited by classroom availability, pictorial representations can be easily reproduced in exercise books, displayed on whiteboards, or shared digitally. This portability enables pupils to work independently and to apply their understanding in varied contexts.

### Bar Modelling

Bar modelling, a technique derived from Singapore mathematics pedagogy, has become increasingly prevalent in English schools as part of teaching for mastery. Bar models are rectangular bars drawn to represent known and unknown quantities in mathematical problems, making relationships between quantities visible.

**Part-whole bar models** represent a quantity as composed of two or more parts. These are particularly useful for addition and subtraction problems, where pupils can see that a whole is made up of constituent parts and that removing a part leaves the other part. For example, the equation 15 + ? = 32 can be represented as a bar of 32 composed of a part of 15 and an unknown part.

**Comparison bar models** show the relationship between two or more quantities, emphasising the difference between them. These models are especially helpful for subtraction and for problems involving "more than" or "less than" relationships. When pupils can see the bars aligned with the difference clearly marked, they are more likely to choose appropriate operations.

**Multiplication and division bar models** extend the part-whole structure to represent equal groups. A multiplication problem such as 4 × 6 can be shown as four equal bars of six, or as one long bar composed of four equal sections. This visualisation supports understanding of the inverse relationship between multiplication and division.

Research evidence suggests that bar modelling is particularly effective for word problems, where the physical act of drawing the model helps pupils identify the mathematical structure underlying the verbal description. The model strips away the narrative context to reveal the essential quantitative relationships.

### Part-Whole Diagrams and Number Lines

**Part-whole diagrams** (sometimes called cherry diagrams or bubble diagrams) represent a number as composed of parts that combine to make the whole. These diagrams are particularly accessible to younger pupils and provide a clear visualisation of number bonds and the inverse relationship between addition and subtraction.

**Number lines** are a fundamental pictorial representation that supports understanding of number sequences, magnitude, and operations. Unlike the part-whole model, which emphasises composition and decomposition, the number line emphasises the ordinal aspect of number and the relationship between operations and movement.

In early number work, number lines might show all numbers from 0 to 20, with pupils physically jumping along the line to perform addition or subtraction. As pupils progress, they work with empty number lines where they mark only the numbers relevant to a particular calculation, developing more efficient "jumping" strategies.

For older pupils, number lines extend to represent negative numbers, fractions, decimals, and eventually the continuous number line that underpins algebraic and graphical thinking. The consistency of this representation across key stages helps pupils see connections between mathematical domains.

### Arrays and Area Models

**Arrays**—rectangular arrangements of objects in rows and columns—provide the fundamental pictorial representation for multiplication and division. When pupils see six rows of four objects, they can count the total, recognise this as 6 × 4, and connect this to repeated addition. The rectangular structure of arrays also foreshadows the commutative property of multiplication (6 × 4 = 4 × 6) and the area model that supports understanding of multi-digit multiplication and algebraic expansion.

The **area model** extends the array concept to represent multiplication as the area of a rectangle. For multi-digit multiplication, the area model decomposes factors into tens and units (or hundreds, tens, and units), creating a grid of partial products that can be calculated separately and then combined. This representation makes the distributive property visible and provides a foundation for understanding the standard multiplication algorithm.

## The Abstract Stage: Working with Symbols

### Characteristics of Abstract Mathematical Thinking

The abstract stage involves working with conventional mathematical notation, numerals, and formal language without the support of concrete materials or pictorial representations. This is the most efficient form of mathematical communication and the goal of mathematics education, but it is also the most cognitively demanding.

Abstract mathematical thinking has several distinguishing characteristics. It is **general**—symbols represent entire classes of situations rather than specific instances. The equation 3 + 4 = 7 applies equally to apples, pounds, days, or any other countable quantity.

It is **compact**—complex relationships can be expressed succinctly using symbols. The algebraic expression (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b² conveys a relationship that would require extensive verbal description.

It is **manipulable**—symbols can be transformed according to rules to solve problems and discover new relationships. The power of algebra lies in the ability to manipulate expressions to reveal structure and solve for unknowns.

### Developing Fluency with Abstract Representation

Fluency with abstract mathematics develops gradually and requires deliberate practice. Ofsted's research review (2021) emphasised that "curriculum progression should be by intelligent practice, not repetitive drills." This means that pupils need varied opportunities to apply abstract procedures in different contexts, with careful attention to building connections between the procedure and the underlying mathematical structure.

**Stepped progression** is essential. Pupils should not be rushed to work abstractly before they have secure conceptual understanding. The CPA approach recognises that some pupils may need to continue using concrete or pictorial supports longer than others, and this is entirely appropriate. The goal is understanding and fluency, not speed of transition to abstract working.

**Dual coding**—using concrete or pictorial representations alongside abstract notation—helps pupils make connections between representations. A teacher might present a calculation alongside a bar model, or have pupils draw a picture to represent an equation. This explicit linking helps pupils understand what the abstract symbols mean and provides a pathway back to understanding if they become confused.

### Common Challenges at the Abstract Stage

The transition to abstract working presents predictable challenges for many pupils. **Symbol confusion** is common, particularly when similar symbols represent different concepts (such as × for multiplication and x for an unknown quantity). Teachers should explicitly teach mathematical vocabulary and notation, helping pupils understand that symbols are tools for communication.

**Loss of meaning**—performing procedures without understanding why they work—is a significant risk at the abstract stage. Pupils may learn to "carry the one" in addition or "borrow" in subtraction without understanding the place value principles involved. The CPA approach mitigates this risk by ensuring that pupils have established conceptual understanding through concrete and pictorial experiences before working abstractly.

**Overload of working memory** can occur when pupils attempt abstract procedures they have not yet automated. When too much conscious attention is required for basic calculations, there is insufficient capacity for problem-solving and reasoning. Regular practice to develop automaticity with number facts and procedures frees working memory for higher-order thinking.

## Implementation Across Key Stages

### Early Years Foundation Stage

In the EYFS, mathematical learning is predominantly concrete, with pupils exploring mathematical concepts through play, stories, and everyday experiences. The statutory framework requires that children develop a strong grounding in number, including counting reliably, understanding the cardinal principle (the last number counted tells how many), and recognising quantities without counting (subitising).

CPA-informed EYFS practice includes carefully structured provision of manipulatives such as counting bears, sorting materials, and construction toys that embody mathematical relationships. Adults support mathematical thinking by modelling mathematical language, asking questions that promote reasoning, and helping children make connections between their play and mathematical concepts.

The pictorial stage begins to emerge in the EYFS through simple representations—children might draw their counting, use stickers to represent quantities, or engage with picture-based mathematical games. These early experiences lay the foundation for more systematic use of pictorial representations in Key Stage 1.

### Key Stage 1

In Key Stage 1, pupils build on their EYFS experiences to develop fluency with whole numbers and the four operations. The CPA approach is central to this development, with pupils continuing to use concrete materials extensively while gradually increasing their use of pictorial representations.

The National Curriculum for Year 1 emphasises that pupils should "count, read and write numbers to 100 in numerals" and "represent and use number bonds and related subtraction facts within 20." These objectives are supported through continued use of Numicon, bead strings, and number frames, alongside the introduction of number lines and part-whole diagrams.

By Year 2, pupils begin to work more systematically with pictorial representations, including bar models for addition and subtraction problems. They should also begin to record their mathematical thinking more formally, using abstract notation alongside concrete and pictorial representations.

### Key Stage 2

Key Stage 2 sees increasing complexity in mathematical content and gradual progression toward more abstract working. However, the CPA approach remains essential throughout this key stage, with pupils continuing to use concrete materials and pictorial representations to support understanding of new concepts.

In lower Key Stage 2 (Years 3 and 4), pupils develop fluency with larger numbers and begin working with fractions and decimals. Place value counters become increasingly important as pupils work with numbers beyond 1000, and fraction tiles or circles support understanding of part-whole relationships.

Upper Key Stage 2 (Years 5 and 6) introduces more complex concepts including percentages, ratio, algebra, and geometry. The area model becomes particularly important for understanding multi-digit multiplication and division, while bar models provide essential support for ratio and proportion problems. Even at this stage, concrete materials such as algebra tiles can support the introduction of abstract algebraic concepts.

Ofsted's subject report noted that effective schools ensure that "pupils have sufficient practice in using resources that expose the mathematical structure they are learning." This applies equally to Key Stage 2 as to earlier years, with the key consideration being appropriate selection of representations for the concept being learned.

### Key Stage 3 and Beyond

While the CPA approach is most strongly associated with primary education, its principles remain valuable throughout secondary schooling and beyond. Key Stage 3 pupils benefit from concrete and pictorial representations when encountering new topics such as algebraic manipulation, geometric proof, and statistical analysis.

**Algebra tiles** provide a concrete representation of variables and constants, allowing pupils to model algebraic expressions and equations physically. These tiles typically represent units (small squares), variables (rectangles), and squared variables (large squares), with different colours distinguishing positive and negative quantities. By physically arranging and manipulating these tiles, pupils can develop understanding of expanding brackets, factorising expressions, and solving equations.

**Graphical representations** serve a pictorial function in secondary mathematics, making functional relationships visible and supporting understanding of gradient, intercept, and transformation. The connection between algebraic and graphical representations is a key focus of Key Stage 3 and 4 mathematics, with pupils learning to move fluently between these representations.

At A-level and beyond, mathematicians continue to use concrete and pictorial thinking, even when working with highly abstract concepts. Visualisation, analogy, and physical models support understanding in areas such as calculus, linear algebra, and complex analysis. The CPA approach thus establishes habits of mind that serve mathematicians throughout their careers.

## Pedagogical Considerations and Classroom Practice

### The Non-Linear Nature of CPA

A common misconception about the CPA approach is that it represents a linear progression from concrete to abstract, with pupils expected to move through each stage in sequence for every topic. In practice, effective CPA implementation is more fluid and iterative.

Teachers should be prepared to **move flexibly between representations** based on pupils' developing understanding. A pupil working on an abstract problem might benefit from returning to concrete materials to verify a solution or understand an error. Similarly, concrete experiences are more effective when pupils are simultaneously encouraged to describe their thinking using mathematical language and to consider how their physical actions connect to abstract notation.

**Simultaneous representation**—using concrete, pictorial, and abstract representations alongside each other—is often the most effective approach. A teacher might present a calculation using Dienes blocks, draw a bar model on the board, and write the abstract equation, explicitly making connections between all three representations. This helps pupils understand that the different representations are different ways of expressing the same mathematical structure.

### Selecting Appropriate Representations

Not all manipulatives are equally effective for all concepts, and teachers must make informed choices about which representations to use. The NCETM's teaching for mastery materials emphasise that representations should be chosen to **expose the mathematical structure** being learned, not merely to provide a physical way of getting an answer.

For place value, **proportional representations** such as Dienes blocks are valuable because the physical size of the materials embodies the magnitude relationship between place values. A pupil can see that a ten rod is composed of ten unit cubes, that a hundred square is composed of ten ten rods, and so on. This proportional relationship supports understanding of exchange and regrouping.

For fractions, **area models** such as fraction circles or rectangles help pupils understand fractions as parts of a whole and support reasoning about equivalence and comparison. **Linear models** such as fraction number lines help pupils understand fractions as numbers with magnitude and support reasoning about ordering and density.

For ratio and proportion, **double number lines** and **ratio tables** provide pictorial structures that make multiplicative relationships visible. These representations are particularly valuable for solving problems involving scaling, conversion, and proportional reasoning.

### The Role of Language and Discussion

The CPA approach emphasises that mathematical understanding is constructed through **social interaction and language**. Manipulatives and diagrams are not merely tools for individual discovery but resources for collaborative sense-making and classroom discussion.

Teachers should structure opportunities for pupils to **explain their thinking**, both to the teacher and to peers. Questions such as "Can you show me using the blocks?", "What would that look like as a bar model?", and "How would you write that using numbers?" encourage pupils to make connections between representations and to articulate their understanding.

**Mathematical vocabulary** should be explicitly taught and consistently used. When pupils handle concrete materials, they should use precise language to describe their actions: "I am exchanging ten ones for one ten" rather than just "I am swapping these." This explicit connection between physical action and mathematical language supports the development of abstract understanding.

## Common Misconceptions and Pitfalls

### Misconception 1: CPA is Only for Young Pupils

Some teachers believe that concrete materials are only appropriate for early years and Key Stage 1, and that older pupils should work exclusively with abstract representations. This is incorrect. The Ofsted mathematics subject report observed that effective schools use manipulatives throughout Key Stage 2 and into secondary education, selecting appropriate representations for the concept being taught.

The key consideration is not the age of the pupil but the novelty of the concept. When pupils encounter new mathematical ideas—whether in Year 1 or Year 10—they benefit from concrete and pictorial experiences that build understanding before abstract working.

### Misconception 2: CPA is a Teaching Technique, Not a Learning Journey

Some teachers use concrete materials as a demonstration tool, showing pupils how to perform procedures using manipulatives before moving quickly to abstract practice. This misses the essential purpose of the CPA approach, which is to provide pupils with direct experience of mathematical structure.

Pupils need **hands-on exploration**, not just observation. They need time to manipulate materials, to make mistakes and correct them, and to develop their own mental models of mathematical concepts. The teacher's role is to structure these experiences, ask probing questions, and help pupils make connections—not to demonstrate procedures to be memorised.

### Misconception 3: Once Abstract, Always Abstract

Some teachers view the stages of CPA as a ladder to be climbed and then abandoned. Once pupils can work abstractly, the reasoning goes, they no longer need concrete or pictorial support. This misconception can leave pupils without resources when they encounter difficulties.

Effective CPA practice recognises that pupils may need to **return to earlier representations** when concepts become challenging. A pupil who has been working abstractly with multiplication might benefit from revisiting arrays or the area model when encountering multi-digit multiplication. A pupil struggling with algebraic fractions might gain insight from returning to concrete or pictorial representations of fractions.

### Pitfall: Over-Reliance on a Single Representation

Some teachers become attached to particular manipulatives or diagrams and use them for all topics. This can limit pupils' understanding and flexibility. Different representations highlight different aspects of mathematical structure, and pupils benefit from experiencing multiple representations of the same concept.

Teachers should aim to provide **varied representational experiences**, using different manipulatives and diagrams to illuminate different aspects of mathematical concepts. This variation helps pupils develop flexible understanding that transfers to new situations.

## Assessment Through the CPA Framework

### Diagnostic Assessment

The CPA approach provides a framework for diagnostic assessment. When pupils make errors or show misunderstanding, examining their use of representations can reveal the source of the difficulty.

A pupil who struggles with abstract calculation might reveal, through work with concrete materials, that they do not understand place value or do not grasp the concept being calculated. A pupil who can manipulate materials but cannot draw or interpret diagrams may need support in developing the visualisation skills that underpin mathematical thinking.

Teachers can use **representational flexibility** as an assessment criterion. Pupils who can move fluently between concrete, pictorial, and abstract representations demonstrate deep understanding. Those who are stuck at one level may need additional support to make connections.

### Formative Assessment Strategies

**Show me** activities, where pupils represent a concept using manipulatives or diagrams, provide immediate insight into understanding. A teacher might ask pupils to "show me 3 × 4 using counters" or "draw a bar model for this problem" and observe the representations produced.

**Multiple representations** tasks require pupils to show the same concept in different ways. "Show me 25 + 17 using Dienes blocks, then draw it as a bar model, then write the calculation" assesses pupils' ability to connect representations and reveals any gaps in understanding.

**Error analysis** using representations can help pupils develop critical thinking. Presenting pupils with a flawed representation and asking them to identify and correct the error encourages attention to mathematical structure and develops reasoning skills.

## Integration with Other Pedagogical Approaches

### Teaching for Mastery

The CPA approach is a cornerstone of teaching for mastery, the pedagogical approach promoted by the NCETM and Maths Hubs across England. Teaching for mastery emphasises that all pupils can achieve in mathematics given appropriate teaching and time, and the CPA approach provides the scaffolding that makes this possible.

In a mastery classroom, CPA is used to ensure that **all pupils develop deep understanding** before moving on. Rather than accelerating some pupils to abstract working while others remain at the concrete stage, the whole class works through the stages together, with the teacher providing additional support or challenge as needed.

The NCETM's "Five Big Ideas" of teaching for mastery—coherence, representation and structure, mathematical thinking, fluency, and variation—are all supported by the CPA approach. The careful selection and sequencing of representations builds coherence and exposes structure; the focus on explaining thinking develops mathematical reasoning; and the variation of representations supports fluency and deep understanding.

### Variation Theory

**Variation theory**, derived from the work of Ference Marton and developed in mathematics education by researchers including Anne Watson and John Mason, emphasises that learning occurs through discerning critical aspects of mathematical objects. The CPA approach supports variation theory by providing multiple representations that highlight different aspects of mathematical structure.

By varying representations while keeping the underlying concept constant, teachers help pupils distinguish between essential mathematical features and incidental surface features. For example, showing multiplication as arrays, as repeated addition on a number line, and as scaling in a bar model helps pupils discern the multiplicative structure that is common to all three representations.

### Oracy and Dialogic Teaching

The CPA approach aligns naturally with **dialogic teaching**, which emphasises classroom talk as a tool for developing understanding. When pupils manipulate concrete materials or create pictorial representations, they have concrete referents to talk about. This supports the development of mathematical vocabulary and reasoning.

Teachers can structure **mathematical conversations** around representations: "Tell me what you've built and why," "How does your drawing show the problem?", "What's the same and what's different about these two representations?" Such questions encourage pupils to articulate their thinking and engage with the reasoning of others.

## Resources and Professional Development

### Essential Classroom Resources

Effective CPA implementation requires appropriate resources. While the specific materials will vary by key stage and concept, some essentials include:

- **Dienes Base 10 blocks** for place value and calculation across Key Stages 1 and 2
- **Place value counters** for upper Key Stage 2 and beyond
- **Numicon or similar number frames** for early number work
- **Bead strings and rekenreks** for developing calculation strategies
- **Cuisenaire rods** for exploring number relationships and equivalence
- **Fraction tiles, circles, and number lines** for fraction concepts
- **Algebra tiles** for secondary algebra
- **Whiteboards and squared paper** for creating pictorial representations

Schools should invest in sufficient quantities of manipulatives to ensure that all pupils can access them simultaneously. The cost of high-quality manipulatives is justified by the depth of understanding they support.

### Professional Development

Implementing the CPA approach effectively requires **ongoing professional development**. Teachers need opportunities to:

- Experience CPA themselves as learners, working through mathematical concepts using concrete and pictorial representations
- Observe expert practitioners modelling CPA in the classroom
- Plan collaboratively, selecting and sequencing representations for specific concepts
- Analyse pupil work, using the CPA framework to diagnose misconceptions and plan interventions
- Engage with research, understanding the theoretical basis for CPA and the evidence supporting its effectiveness

The NCETM and local Maths Hubs provide extensive professional development opportunities focused on teaching for mastery and the CPA approach. Schools should prioritise participation in these programmes to build staff expertise.

## Conclusion

The Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract approach represents a powerful synthesis of theoretical insight and classroom practice. Grounded in Jerome Bruner's research on modes of representation and refined through decades of implementation in Singapore and England, CPA provides a framework for teaching mathematics that builds deep, lasting understanding.

The approach recognises that mathematical learning is not a single act of abstraction but a gradual process of building connections between experience, imagery, and symbol. By providing pupils with structured opportunities to engage with mathematical concepts through physical manipulation, visual representation, and abstract notation, teachers can ensure that all pupils develop the conceptual foundation necessary for mathematical success.

As Ofsted's subject report "Coordinating Mathematical Success" makes clear, effective mathematics teaching requires consistent use of the CPA approach, with particular attention to developing deep understanding of core number concepts from the earliest stages. Schools that embrace CPA as a fundamental principle of mathematics pedagogy, supported by appropriate resources and professional development, create the conditions for all pupils to achieve mastery of mathematics.
