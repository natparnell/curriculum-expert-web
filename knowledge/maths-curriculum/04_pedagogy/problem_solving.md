# Problem Solving in Mathematics

## Introduction and National Context

Problem solving sits alongside fluency and reasoning as one of the three core aims of the National Curriculum for Mathematics (DfE, 2013). The curriculum states that pupils should be taught to solve problems by applying their mathematics to a variety of routine and non-routine problems with increasing sophistication, including breaking down problems into a series of simpler steps and persevering in seeking solutions.

This tripartite structure—fluency, reasoning, and problem solving—represents a significant shift from earlier iterations of the curriculum. Whilst previous versions emphasised procedural competence, the 2013 curriculum explicitly positions problem solving as a distinct aim requiring dedicated pedagogical attention. As NRICH (2015) observes, this framework has catalysed renewed interest in developing pupils' capacity to think mathematically, rather than merely perform calculations.

The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF, 2018) notes that problem solving presents particular pedagogical challenges because, by definition, problems have no fixed routine or predetermined solution pathway. This unpredictability distinguishes genuine problem solving from the routine application of learned procedures. When pupils merely apply a recently taught algorithm to similar questions, they are exercising procedural fluency rather than engaging in problem solving proper.

## Defining Problem Solving in the Mathematics Classroom

### Characteristics of Genuine Mathematical Problems

Schoenfeld (1985) provides a foundational distinction between exercises and problems. An exercise is a question that the learner knows how to answer immediately—it requires only the straightforward application of a known procedure. A problem, conversely, is a question for which the learner possesses the necessary mathematical resources but does not have an immediately accessible solution method.

This definition has important implications for classroom practice. What constitutes a problem for one pupil may be merely an exercise for another. A Year 7 pupil encountering algebraic equations for the first time faces a genuine problem; for a Year 11 pupil preparing for GCSE, the same equation represents routine practice. Effective problem-solving instruction therefore requires careful attention to pupils' prior knowledge and the progressive complexity of tasks.

Ofsted's mathematics subject report "Coordinating Mathematical Success" (2023) emphasises that problem solving should not be treated as an add-on or enrichment activity for high-attaining pupils. Rather, it should be embedded across the curriculum and accessible to all learners. The report identifies a common weakness where schools relegate problem solving to the end of topics or extension activities, rather than integrating it into daily mathematical experience.

### Type 1 and Type 2 Problems

The NCETM and exam boards distinguish between two types of problems, a distinction that has become increasingly significant with the reformed GCSE specifications:

**Type 1 problems** require pupils to apply routine procedures in familiar contexts. These problems typically appear after a new concept has been introduced and allow pupils to consolidate their understanding through practice. For example, calculating the area of a triangle when given the base and height, following explicit instruction on the formula, represents a Type 1 problem.

**Type 2 problems** demand reasoning and the application of mathematical knowledge in unfamiliar contexts. These problems may require pupils to:
- Select appropriate mathematical techniques from across different topic areas
- Interpret complex information presented in varied formats
- Formulate problems for themselves from given information
- Evaluate the reasonableness of their answers in context

Ofsted (2023) found that in the most effective schools, all pupils regularly encounter Type 2 problems rather than such challenges being reserved for higher-attaining learners. The report notes that when teachers restrict Type 2 problems to extension work, they inadvertently limit the mathematical development of the majority of pupils.

## Polya's Four-Stage Framework

George Pólya's seminal work "How to Solve It" (1945) established the foundational framework for teaching mathematical problem solving that remains influential today. Pólya articulated four stages that mathematicians move through when tackling problems:

### Stage 1: Understanding the Problem

Before attempting any solution, pupils must develop a thorough understanding of what is being asked. This involves:
- Reading the problem carefully, potentially multiple times
- Identifying what is known (the given information)
- Identifying what is unknown (what must be found)
- Recognising conditions and constraints
- Representing the problem in alternative forms (diagrams, tables, algebraic expressions)

Pólya emphasised that insufficient time spent on understanding is a primary cause of failure in problem solving. Pupils frequently rush to calculation without grasping the problem's structure. Teaching pupils to paraphrase problems, identify key information, and represent relationships visually constitutes essential groundwork.

### Stage 2: Devising a Plan

Once the problem is understood, pupils must select or devise a strategy for solution. Pólya catalogued numerous heuristic strategies including:

**Working backwards**: Starting from the desired outcome and determining the steps needed to reach it. Particularly effective for problems involving sequences of operations or inverse relationships.

**Drawing a diagram**: Visual representation often reveals relationships not apparent in verbal or symbolic form. This strategy proves especially valuable for geometric problems and ratio relationships.

**Making a systematic list or table**: Organising information helps identify patterns and ensures all possibilities are considered. Useful for probability questions and enumeration problems.

**Looking for patterns**: Examining specific cases to identify general rules. Central to mathematical induction and algebraic generalisation.

**Simplifying the problem**: Working with easier numbers or reduced complexity before returning to the original problem.

**Guessing and checking**: Making intelligent estimates and refining based on feedback. Develops number sense and approximation skills.

**Using known results**: Recognising that a new problem resembles one previously solved.

Explicit instruction in these heuristics, combined with opportunities to apply them in varied contexts, develops pupils' strategic repertoire. The EEF (2018) notes that teaching problem-solving strategies explicitly is more effective than assuming pupils will discover them through exposure alone.

### Stage 3: Carrying Out the Plan

This stage involves implementing the chosen strategy with care and precision. Pólya observed that this is often the easiest stage—provided the previous stages have been completed thoroughly. Key aspects include:
- Executing calculations or procedures systematically
- Monitoring the approach for signs of difficulty
- Maintaining accurate records of working
- Being prepared to abandon unproductive approaches

The ability to carry out a plan effectively depends upon the foundational fluency emphasised in the National Curriculum. Pupils who struggle with basic calculations find their working memory consumed by procedural execution, leaving insufficient capacity for strategic thinking.

### Stage 4: Looking Back

The final stage—often neglected in classroom practice—involves reviewing and reflecting upon the solution. This includes:
- Checking the answer for reasonableness in context
- Verifying calculations and reasoning
- Considering whether alternative approaches might have been more efficient
- Exploring whether the method generalises to related problems
- Articulating what was learned that might apply to future problems

Research by the British Society for Research into Learning Mathematics (BSRLM, 2016) identified the "look back" stage as the weakest link in pupils' problem-solving processes. Teachers frequently move immediately to new problems once a solution is found, missing valuable opportunities to consolidate learning through reflection.

## Schoenfeld's Theoretical Framework

Alan Schoenfeld's research (1985, 1992) advanced understanding of mathematical problem solving by identifying four components necessary for success:

### 1. Resources (Propositional and Procedural Knowledge)

Resources comprise the body of mathematical facts and procedures at a pupil's disposal. This includes knowledge of facts (number bonds, times tables, geometric properties), algorithms (column addition, solving linear equations), and routine procedures. Without adequate resources, pupils cannot engage effectively with problems regardless of their strategic sophistication.

Schoenfeld's research demonstrated that resource limitations often masquerade as strategic failures. When pupils appear unable to solve a problem, the underlying cause may be gaps in foundational knowledge rather than deficits in problem-solving ability. This finding underscores the National Curriculum's integration of fluency alongside problem solving—fluency enables problem solving by freeing cognitive resources for higher-level thinking.

### 2. Heuristics (Strategies and Techniques)

Heuristics are the rules of thumb and strategies for making progress on unfamiliar problems. Schoenfeld expanded upon Pólya's catalogue to include techniques such as:
- Drawing figures and diagrams
- Working backwards from the desired conclusion
- Exploiting extreme or special cases
- Using analogy with related problems
- Decomposing problems into sub-problems

Schoenfeld argued that heuristics must be taught explicitly and practised deliberately. Simply exposing pupils to problems does not automatically develop strategic competence.

### 3. Control (Metacognitive Self-Regulation)

Control refers to the ability to monitor and regulate one's own problem-solving process. This includes:
- Selecting appropriate strategies
- Evaluating progress
- Deciding when to persist and when to change approach
- Allocating time appropriately across problem elements
- Recognising and recovering from errors

Schoenfeld found that expert problem solvers differ from novices not primarily in their resources or heuristics, but in their metacognitive control. Experts regularly pause to assess whether their current approach remains productive; novices persist with ineffective strategies long after they should have changed course.

### 4. Belief Systems

Beliefs about mathematics shape how pupils approach problems. Pupils who view mathematics as a collection of fixed rules to be memorised approach problems differently from those who see mathematics as a domain of sense-making and exploration. Negative beliefs—such as "I'm not a maths person" or "Maths problems should be solvable in under five minutes"—significantly impede problem-solving performance.

The EEF (2018) highlights that developing metacognitive strategies—closely related to Schoenfeld's control dimension—receives strong evidence of effectiveness in improving mathematics outcomes. Teaching pupils to plan, monitor, and evaluate their thinking yields significant gains.

## Pedagogical Approaches: EEF Recommendations

The Education Endowment Foundation's guidance report "Improving Mathematics in Key Stages 2 and 3" (2018, updated 2022) provides evidence-based recommendations for teaching problem solving:

### Recommendation 3: Teach Pupils Strategies for Solving Problems

The EEF emphasises that problem-solving strategies should be taught explicitly. Teachers should:
- Model the use of specific strategies (working backwards, drawing diagrams, systematic listing)
- Provide scaffolded practice with each strategy before expecting independent application
- Encourage pupils to articulate their thinking and strategy selection
- Help pupils recognise which strategies are appropriate for which problem types

This recommendation challenges approaches that simply present pupils with problems and expect them to discover effective strategies through trial and error. While discovery has its place, explicit instruction in problem-solving heuristics proves more efficient and equitable.

### Recommendation 5: Develop Pupils' Metacognition

The EEF identifies metacognitive strategies—teaching pupils to plan, monitor, and evaluate their learning—as having strong evidence of positive impact. In problem solving specifically, this involves:

**Planning**: Before beginning, pupils should identify what they know, what they need to find out, and what strategies might prove useful.

**Monitoring**: During problem solving, pupils should regularly assess whether their approach is working and whether they need to adjust their strategy.

**Evaluating**: After solving, pupils should reflect on the process, considering whether their answer is reasonable, whether alternative approaches might have been better, and what they learned that applies to future problems.

The EEF suggests using prompts and scaffolds to develop these metacognitive habits, gradually fading support as pupils internalise the processes.

### Using Worked Examples

Research cited by the EEF demonstrates that studying worked examples—step-by-step demonstrations of solution methods—improves problem-solving performance, particularly for novice learners. Worked examples should:
- Include explicit narration of the reasoning at each step
- Highlight crucial decisions and why they were made
- Show common errors and how to avoid them
- Progress from fully worked examples to partially completed problems (completion problems) to independent practice

As pupils develop expertise, worked examples should become less frequent, replaced by independent problem solving. The transition should be managed carefully to maintain challenge without overwhelming working memory.

## Progression Across Key Stages

### Early Years and Key Stage 1

Problem solving begins in the Early Years Foundation Stage within the Mathematics area of learning, though at this stage the emphasis is on practical exploration and investigation. The Early Learning Goals include solving real-world mathematical problems with numbers up to 10.

At Key Stage 1, the National Curriculum requires pupils to solve one-step problems involving addition and subtraction using concrete objects and pictorial representations. Multiplication and division problems are introduced through grouping and sharing contexts. Teachers should:
- Use stories and real-life contexts to make problems meaningful
- Provide manipulatives (counters, number lines, base-10 blocks) for all pupils
- Encourage pupils to represent problems through drawing
- Model the language of problem solving ("What do we know?" "What do we need to find out?")

Common misconceptions at this stage include:
- Selecting the wrong operation based on superficial features (e.g., assuming "more" always means add)
- Difficulty interpreting the question being asked
- Failure to check whether answers are reasonable

### Key Stage 2

At Key Stage 2, problem solving becomes increasingly sophisticated. Pupils solve multi-step problems, work with fractions and decimals, and tackle problems involving measure, geometry, and statistics. The DfE Mathematics Guidance for KS1 and KS2 (2020) provides ready-to-progress criteria that emphasise problem solving within specific domains.

The NCETM's Curriculum Prioritisation materials identify problem-solving opportunities within each topic area. For example, in the fractions ready-to-progress criteria, pupils solve problems involving addition and subtraction of fractions with the same denominator.

By Upper Key Stage 2, pupils should:
- Solve problems requiring multiple operations and steps
- Identify and apply appropriate strategies independently
- Interpret remainders in division problems according to context
- Begin working with simple algebraic problems

Ofsted (2023) found that in primary schools with strong problem-solving provision, teachers consistently built retrieval practice into lessons, ensuring pupils had the foundational fluency to tackle more complex problems.

### Key Stage 3

At Key Stage 3, problem solving extends across the full breadth of mathematics. Pupils encounter problems involving ratio and proportion, algebra, geometry, statistics, and probability. The EEF guidance for KS2 and KS3 emphasises that problem solving should not be taught as a separate topic but integrated throughout the curriculum.

The NCETM's Secondary Mastery Professional Development materials structure problem solving around key mathematical themes. For example, in the algebra strand, pupils solve problems requiring them to form and solve linear equations, including those arising from geometric contexts.

Effective KS3 problem-solving pedagogy includes:
- Using rich tasks that allow multiple entry points and solution methods
- Encouraging mathematical discussion and the sharing of different approaches
- Making explicit connections between topics and problem-solving strategies
- Developing pupils' capacity to work systematically on extended problems

### Key Stage 4 and GCSE

The reformed GCSE Mathematics specifications (first examined 2017) allocate a significant proportion of marks to Assessment Objective 3 (AO3): "Solve problems within mathematics and in other contexts." For Higher tier, AO3 accounts for approximately 30% of marks; for Foundation tier, approximately 25%.

AO3 problems are characterised by:
- Unfamiliar or unstructured contexts
- Requirement to select and apply multiple mathematical techniques
- Need to interpret results in context
- Multi-step reasoning chains

Exam boards provide extensive problem-solving resources:
- AQA's Problem Solving collection includes questions at Foundation and Higher tiers
- Edexcel's "90 Problem Solving Questions" provides practice materials designed specifically for AO3
- OCR's GCSE (9-1) Maths includes problem-solving questions throughout practice papers

Effective GCSE preparation for problem solving involves:
- Regular exposure to non-routine problems throughout the course, not just in revision
- Practice with questions that combine multiple topic areas
- Development of resilience for problems that cannot be solved immediately
- Familiarity with command words and assessment rubrics

## Common Misconceptions and Challenges

### Misconception 1: Problem Solving Equals Word Problems

Many teachers and pupils conflate problem solving with word problems—questions presented in verbal rather than symbolic form. However, word problems vary enormously in their problem-solving demands. Some word problems merely require translation into symbols followed by routine calculation; others demand genuine strategic thinking. Conversely, purely symbolic problems can be highly demanding of problem-solving resources.

Effective teaching distinguishes between linguistic complexity and problem-solving demand. Pupils may struggle with word problems because of reading comprehension difficulties rather than mathematical deficits.

### Misconception 2: Pupils Must Master Fluency Before Problem Solving

A common belief holds that pupils must achieve complete fluency before engaging with problem solving. Research contradicts this view. Problem solving and fluency develop reciprocally—problems provide contexts that make fluency meaningful, whilst fluency frees cognitive resources for problem-solving thinking.

The National Curriculum's three aims are designed to be developed together, not sequentially. Even as pupils develop initial understanding of concepts, carefully chosen problems can deepen that understanding.

### Misconception 3: There Is Always One Right Method

Pupils often believe that mathematics problems have a single correct approach. This belief undermines their willingness to experiment and explore alternative strategies. Teaching should regularly highlight problems amenable to multiple solution methods, inviting comparison and discussion of different approaches.

### Challenge: Pupil Disposition and Resilience

Problem solving inevitably involves struggle and occasional failure. Pupils accustomed to immediate success with routine exercises may experience problem-solving challenges as threatening. Teachers must cultivate classroom cultures that:
- Value persistence and strategic thinking over rapid solution
- Treat errors and dead-ends as learning opportunities
- Celebrate the process of problem solving, not merely the product
- Normalise the experience of being "stuck" and the strategies for getting unstuck

Carol Dweck's research on growth mindset, whilst contested in some aspects, highlights the importance of pupils believing that their mathematical capabilities can develop through effort and learning.

## Practical Classroom Strategies

### The CPA Approach

The Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach, central to teaching for mastery, provides a foundation for problem solving:

**Concrete**: Pupils engage with physical objects to model problems. This might involve using counters to represent quantities, Cuisenaire rods to explore number relationships, or algebra tiles to represent variables and expressions.

**Pictorial**: Pupils represent problems through drawings and diagrams. Bar models, for example, provide a powerful visual tool for representing additive and multiplicative relationships. The NCETM's materials demonstrate how bar modelling supports problem solving across multiple topic areas.

**Abstract**: Pupils work with symbolic representations—numbers, algebraic notation, equations. The transition to abstraction should occur when pupils have secure understanding at the concrete and pictorial levels. Premature abstraction undermines problem-solving capacity.

### Bar Modelling

Bar modelling, derived from Singapore mathematics pedagogy, provides a consistent visual approach to problem solving across the primary years and into Key Stage 3. The NCETM has championed bar modelling as a powerful tool for representing:
- Part-whole relationships in addition and subtraction
- Comparison situations (how many more/less)
- Multiplication and division as scaling
- Ratio and proportion problems
- Algebraic relationships

Effective bar modelling instruction progresses from discrete units (individual squares) to continuous bars, and from single-bar representations to comparison and multi-step models.

### Rich Tasks and Low Threshold, High Ceiling Activities

Rich mathematical tasks support problem solving by offering multiple entry points and opportunities for extension. Characteristics of rich tasks include:
- Accessibility to all pupils whilst offering depth for high attainers
- Opportunities for pupils to make decisions and explore
- Potential for different approaches and solutions
- Scope for pupils to extend or generalise

NRICH provides extensive collections of rich tasks organised by topic and key stage. The NCETM's Departmental Workshops and the Mathematics Assessment Project's Classroom Challenges offer further resources.

### Think-Pair-Share

The think-pair-share strategy develops problem-solving discourse:
1. **Think**: Individual thinking time before any discussion
2. **Pair**: Discussion with a partner to share and refine ideas
3. **Share**: Whole-class discussion building on paired work

This structure ensures all pupils engage with the problem, not just those who raise their hands first. It provides processing time and reduces the pressure of immediate public response.

### The "I See... I Wonder..." Protocol

Adapted from the Visible Thinking programme, this protocol develops problem analysis:
- **I See**: Pupils describe what they notice in the problem (facts, numbers, relationships)
- **I Wonder**: Pupils pose questions about the situation
- **I Think**: Pupils begin to formulate solution approaches

This structured approach supports the "understanding the problem" phase of Pólya's framework.

## Assessment of Problem Solving

### Classroom Assessment Strategies

Effective assessment of problem solving requires attention to process as well as product:

**Diagnostic assessment**: Before teaching, identify pupils' existing problem-solving strategies and misconceptions through carefully chosen tasks.

**Formative assessment**: During instruction, observe pupils' approaches, ask probing questions, and provide feedback that develops strategic thinking rather than merely correcting errors.

**Summative assessment**: End-of-topic or end-of-year assessments should include problems that require pupils to select and apply appropriate strategies independently.

### GCSE Assessment Objective 3

The reformed GCSE Mathematics qualifications assess problem solving through AO3:

- **Foundation tier**: Approximately 25% of marks
- **Higher tier**: Approximately 30% of marks

AO3 questions typically:
- Present unstructured problems requiring pupils to formulate their own approach
- Require application of mathematics in unfamiliar contexts
- Demand multi-step reasoning chains
- May combine content from different topic areas

Ofqual and exam board specifications emphasise that AO3 cannot be assessed through routine questions requiring only recall and application of standard procedures.

## Professional Development for Teachers

Developing expertise in teaching problem solving requires ongoing professional learning:

### Subject Knowledge Enhancement

Teachers benefit from engaging with problem solving themselves, exploring rich tasks and examining different solution approaches. The NCETM's Professional Development materials, the Advanced Mathematics Support Programme (AMSP), and the Mathematical Association provide opportunities for subject knowledge development.

### Pedagogical Development

Effective professional development addresses:
- Selection and adaptation of rich tasks for different classes
- Facilitating productive mathematical discussion
- Asking questions that develop thinking rather than merely guiding to answers
- Assessing problem-solving process, not merely products
- Developing classroom cultures that support productive struggle

Lesson study, collaborative planning, and video analysis of problem-solving lessons provide powerful professional development structures.

## Conclusion

Problem solving represents both a core aim of the National Curriculum and a significant pedagogical challenge. Effective teaching of problem solving requires:

1. **Explicit instruction** in problem-solving strategies and heuristics
2. **Metacognitive development**, teaching pupils to plan, monitor, and evaluate their thinking
3. **Integration across the curriculum**, not relegation to extension work
4. **Attention to disposition**, cultivating resilience and productive beliefs about mathematics
5. **Progressive complexity**, with careful attention to what constitutes a genuine problem for each pupil
6. **Rich tasks and multiple representations**, using CPA and bar modelling to support understanding

Research consistently demonstrates that problem-solving capabilities can be developed through deliberate instruction and carefully structured practice. This development is not automatic—it requires teachers who understand problem-solving processes, who select appropriate tasks, and who create classroom cultures where struggle and strategic thinking are valued.

The frameworks of Pólya and Schoenfeld provide theoretical foundations, whilst resources from the NCETM, NRICH, and exam boards offer practical support. The EEF's evidence-based recommendations, particularly around explicit strategy instruction and metacognitive development, point the way toward effective pedagogy.

As Ofsted's 2023 report emphasises, the schools achieving the strongest outcomes ensure that all pupils regularly engage with Type 2 problems—challenges that require reasoning and the application of knowledge in unfamiliar contexts. This requires deliberate curriculum design and sustained professional commitment to developing problem-solving expertise.
