# Mathematical Talk and Dialogue in the Primary Classroom

## Overview

Mathematical talk and dialogue are foundational pedagogical approaches that transform the mathematics classroom from a place of silent computation into a vibrant community of inquiry. The National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics (NCETM) emphasises that teaching for mastery "assumes everyone can learn and enjoy mathematics" and that oracy—the ability to express thoughts and ideas fluently through speech—is essential to this vision. Through structured talk, pupils develop deeper conceptual understanding, learn to articulate their reasoning, and engage in the collaborative construction of mathematical knowledge.

This knowledge base explores the theoretical foundations of mathematical dialogue, practical strategies for implementing talk in the classroom, and the specific techniques that support pupils in becoming confident mathematical communicators. Drawing on the work of Robin Alexander, Neil Mercer, and the NCETM's teaching for mastery programme, this resource provides a comprehensive guide to developing oracy-rich mathematics classrooms.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Dialogic Teaching and Robin Alexander's Framework

Robin Alexander's concept of dialogic teaching, articulated in his seminal work *Towards Dialogic Teaching* (2008) and developed further in *Essays on Pedagogy*, provides a powerful theoretical foundation for mathematical talk. Alexander identifies five principles of dialogic teaching that are particularly relevant to mathematics classrooms:

1. **Collective**: Teachers and children address learning tasks together, whether as a group or a class
2. **Reciprocal**: Teachers and children listen to each other, share ideas, and consider alternative viewpoints
3. **Supportive**: Children articulate their ideas freely, without fear of embarrassment over "wrong" answers, and help each other to reach common understandings
4. **Cumulative**: Teachers and children build on their own and each other's ideas and chain them into coherent lines of thinking and enquiry
5. **Purposeful**: Teachers plan and facilitate dialogic teaching with educational goals in mind

Alexander's concept of "inter-thinking"—where teachers and pupils collectively use rich dialogue to co-construct understanding—is central to the teaching for mastery approach. In oracy-rich classrooms, pupils do not simply receive mathematical knowledge; they actively participate in its construction through purposeful dialogue.

### Exploratory Talk and Neil Mercer's Research

Neil Mercer's research on classroom dialogue, developed through the Thinking Together programme with Lyn Dawes and Rupert Wegerif, provides evidence-based strategies for improving the quality of pupil talk. Mercer identifies three types of classroom talk:

**Disputational Talk**: Characterised by disagreement and individualised decision-making. Pupils in this mode tend to assert their own views without considering alternatives, often resulting in competitive rather than collaborative interaction.

**Cumulative Talk**: In this mode, pupils build positively but uncritically on what others say. While collaborative, cumulative talk lacks the challenge and critical engagement necessary for deep learning.

**Exploratory Talk**: This is the gold standard for productive classroom dialogue. In exploratory talk, pupils engage critically but constructively with each other's ideas. They offer statements and suggestions for joint consideration, challenge each other's proposals with reasons, and work towards consensus. Mercer's research demonstrates that when pupils are taught to use exploratory talk, their problem-solving performance in mathematics and science improves significantly.

Mercer and colleagues developed the concept of "ground rules for talk"—explicit agreements about how pupils should interact during collaborative activities. These ground rules transform classroom culture by making implicit expectations explicit, providing pupils with the tools they need to engage in productive dialogue.

### The Link Between Oracy and Mastery

The Oracy Education Commission's 2024 report, "The Future of Oracy," places oracy at the heart of learning across all subjects. The report highlights the importance of disciplinary oracy—the ability to think, reason, and communicate within specific subjects. For mathematics, this means developing pupils' capacity to use mathematical language precisely, to construct and critique mathematical arguments, and to participate in the distinctive forms of reasoning that characterise the discipline.

The NCETM's framework for oracy in mathematics identifies several key principles:

- **Authentic listening**: Teachers and pupils genuinely attend to each other's mathematical contributions
- **Articulation of mathematical thinking**: Pupils develop the vocabulary and structures needed to express mathematical ideas clearly
- **Development of mathematical reasoning**: Through dialogue, pupils learn to justify, generalise, and prove

Research and Innovation Work Groups on oracy, led across England through the Maths Hubs Network, have documented the transformative impact of oracy-rich classrooms, particularly for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. When every voice matters, pupils gain confidence in sharing their mathematical thinking and learn to appreciate and build on others' ideas.

## Key Strategies for Mathematical Talk

### Creating an Expectation of Mathematical Talk

Developing a classroom culture where mathematical talk is the norm requires sustained effort and clear expectations. Teachers can employ several strategies:

**Choral Repetition**: When introducing new vocabulary or sentence structures, choral repetition provides all pupils with the opportunity to practise speaking mathematically in a low-stakes, supported environment. This whole-class approach models correct pronunciation and intonation while building confidence.

**Full Sentence Expectation**: Setting an expectation that pupils respond to questions using full sentences, even for short, closed questions, develops the syntactic structures needed for more complex mathematical communication. For example, rather than accepting "Seven" as an answer, teachers might ask pupils to say, "The answer is seven because..."

**Process-Focused Questions**: Questions that direct attention to method rather than solution reduce anxiety about being "wrong" and create a more discursive atmosphere. Questions such as "What do you notice?" or "What do you think would happen if...?" invite exploration rather than simple recall.

**Longitudinal Development**: Teachers report that talk happens more spontaneously in upper key stages after pupils have become accustomed to mathematical talk over several years. Building expectations from Early Years Foundation Stage through Key Stage 2 creates cumulative benefits.

### Introducing and Embedding Mathematical Vocabulary

The explicit teaching of mathematical vocabulary is essential for effective communication. The NCETM recommends that teachers:

**Use Technical and Precise Language**: Rather than avoiding technical terms or replacing them with simplified alternatives, teachers should introduce mathematical vocabulary explicitly and plan for its careful introduction and use. Terms such as equation, addend, subtrahend, subitise, and calculate can be engaging for children when presented with appropriate context and etymological exploration.

**Address Multiple Meanings**: Many mathematical terms have different meanings in everyday English. Words such as sum (often used generically when addition is meant), equals (sometimes understood as "makes" rather than equivalence), average, and half require careful attention to mathematical precision. Similarly, words like difference, factor, negative, and range have mathematical meanings that differ from everyday usage.

**Use the Frayer Model**: This graphic organiser supports vocabulary development by requiring pupils to define a term, provide characteristics and examples, and identify non-examples. The structure helps pupils develop nuanced understanding of mathematical concepts.

**Create Mathematical Word Walls**: Displaying key vocabulary with definitions, examples, and visual representations provides ongoing support for pupils as they develop their mathematical communication.

## Exploratory Talk in Practice

### Establishing Ground Rules for Talk

The foundation of productive collaborative work in mathematics is a shared understanding of how pupils should interact. Ground rules for talk are co-constructed with pupils and might include:

- We share ideas and listen to each other
- We ask questions to understand better
- We give reasons for our opinions
- We agree and disagree respectfully
- We try to reach agreement
- We build on each other's ideas

These rules are not simply posted on the wall but are explicitly taught, practised, and reinforced. Pupils need opportunities to reflect on whether their talk follows the ground rules and to identify how they can improve their collaborative practice.

Research by Howe, Hennessy, Mercer and colleagues found that high-quality group work characterised by exploratory talk was linked to stronger performance of Year 6 pupils in mathematics and English SATs. The Cambridge Classroom Dialogue Project demonstrated that teaching ground rules for talk produces measurable improvements in attainment.

### Structuring Exploratory Talk Activities

**The Thinking Together Approach**: Developed by Mercer, Dawes, and Wegerif, this approach involves:

1. **Introduction**: The teacher introduces the concept of talking together effectively and discusses with pupils what makes talk productive
2. **Modelling**: The teacher models exploratory talk, making the ground rules visible through think-alouds
3. **Practice**: Pupils engage in collaborative activities with explicit attention to using the ground rules
4. **Reflection**: Pupils evaluate their talk against the ground rules and set targets for improvement
5. **Application**: The skills are applied across the curriculum, including in mathematics problem-solving

**Computer-Based Collaboration**: Research from the Open University has explored how computer-based activities can scaffold exploratory talk. When pupils work together at a computer to solve mathematical problems, the technology provides a shared focus and can support the development of collaborative dialogue. The prompt "Don't think in your head, think aloud" encourages pupils to verbalise their thinking for the benefit of their peers.

### Teacher Facilitation of Exploratory Talk

The teacher's role in facilitating exploratory talk is crucial. Effective facilitation involves:

**Withdrawing from the Centre**: Rather than dominating discussion, teachers position themselves as facilitators, allowing pupils to address each other directly and build on each other's contributions.

**Using Wait Time**: Providing adequate wait time after asking a question allows pupils to formulate their thoughts and increases the quality and length of responses.

**Probing for Reasoning**: Questions such as "Why do you think that?", "Can you say more about that?", and "What makes you say that?" push pupils to articulate their reasoning and justify their mathematical thinking.

**Making Thinking Public**: Teachers can highlight productive contributions, making the reasoning process visible to all pupils: "Did everyone hear what Sarah just said? She noticed that..."

## Stem Sentences and Language Scaffolds

### The Purpose of Stem Sentences

Stem sentences provide linguistic structures that support pupils in expressing mathematical ideas with precision. They are particularly valuable for:

- Pupils with English as an additional language
- Pupils who struggle to articulate their thinking
- Introducing new mathematical concepts
- Developing generalisation and proof

Stem sentences serve as scaffolds that can gradually be removed as pupils internalise the structures and adapt them for their own purposes.

### Categories of Stem Sentences

**Generic Sentence Starters**: These provide general structures for mathematical talk:
- I agree because...
- I disagree because...
- I would like to add...
- I have a different idea...
- Can you explain what you mean by...?

**Mathematical Reasoning Stems**: These support specific types of mathematical thinking:
- I know that... because...
- I think that... because...
- If I know... then I know...
- I worked systematically by...
- This always works because...
- I noticed a pattern...

**Concept-Specific Stems**: These are developed for particular mathematical topics:
- A whole is always bigger than a part of the whole
- A part is always smaller than its whole
- _____ tenths is equivalent to _____
- The relationship between _____ and _____ is...

### Implementing Stem Sentences Effectively

**Modelling**: Teachers should model the use of stem sentences, demonstrating how they structure thinking and communication.

**Choral Practice**: Whole-class repetition of stem sentences helps embed the structures and builds fluency.

**Display and Reference**: Stem sentences should be displayed prominently and referred to during discussions.

**Gradual Release**: As pupils become more confident, the scaffolding can be gradually removed, with pupils adapting the structures for their own purposes.

## Think-Pair-Share

### The Structure

Think-Pair-Share is a structured collaborative learning strategy that provides pupils with thinking time, the opportunity to rehearse ideas with a partner, and the confidence to share with a larger group. The three phases are:

**Think**: Pupils are given time to think independently about a question or problem. This individual thinking time is crucial for ensuring that all pupils engage with the task and formulate their own ideas before being influenced by others.

**Pair**: Pupils share their thinking with a partner. This low-stakes environment allows for rehearsal, clarification, and the refinement of ideas. Pupils can practise using mathematical vocabulary and reasoning structures before speaking to the whole class.

**Share**: Selected pairs share their thinking with the whole class. The teacher facilitates this sharing, making connections between different contributions and highlighting effective mathematical reasoning.

### Variations and Adaptations

**Think-Write-Pair-Share**: Adding a written component can support pupils in organising their thoughts and provide a record of thinking for later reflection.

**Think-Pair-Square-Share**: After pairs have discussed, pairs join with another pair to share and refine ideas before whole-class sharing. This extended rehearsal builds confidence and improves the quality of contributions.

**Randomised Sharing**: Rather than asking for volunteers, teachers use random selection strategies (such as lollipop sticks or digital tools) to ensure all pupils remain accountable and engaged throughout the process.

### Benefits for Mathematical Learning

Research has documented several benefits of Think-Pair-Share in mathematics classrooms:

**Increased Participation**: The structure ensures that all pupils engage with the question, not just those who would typically volunteer answers. This is particularly beneficial for shy pupils or those lacking confidence in their mathematical abilities.

**Improved Quality of Explanations**: The opportunity to rehearse ideas with a partner before sharing with the whole class results in longer, more articulate explanations. Teachers report gaining more insight into pupils' thinking through these structured shares.

**Reduced Anxiety**: The low-stakes pair discussion reduces the anxiety associated with whole-class participation, creating a more inclusive classroom environment.

**Development of Listening Skills**: Pupils learn to listen to their partner's ideas, building the foundation for more complex collaborative work.

## Talk Moves and Accountable Talk

### Accountable Talk Moves

Developed by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, accountable talk moves are specific strategies that teachers use to support rich mathematical discussion. These moves help discourse move beyond the traditional Initiate-Response-Evaluate (IRE) pattern, where the teacher asks a question, a student responds briefly, and the teacher evaluates the response.

**Revoicing**: The teacher repeats, rephrases, or translates what a pupil has said, often adding mathematical precision:
- "So you're saying that..."
- "Let me see if I've understood. You think that..."

**Asking Pupils to Restate**: The teacher asks another pupil to repeat or rephrase a classmate's contribution:
- "Who can say in their own words what Jamie just explained?"
- "Can someone explain Katie's method?"

**Asking Pupils to Apply Their Own Reasoning**: The teacher asks pupils to apply their own reasoning to someone else's contribution:
- "Do you agree or disagree with what Alex said? Why?"
- "How does your method compare to Suki's?"

**Prompting for Further Participation**: The teacher invites additional contributions:
- "What do other people think?"
- "Who can add to this idea?"

**Using Wait Time**: The teacher allows adequate thinking time before expecting a response, and again after a response to allow pupils to elaborate.

### Creating a Culture of Accountable Talk

Implementing accountable talk moves requires more than learning a set of techniques. Teachers must create classroom cultures where:

- All contributions are treated with respect
- Mistakes are viewed as learning opportunities
- Reasoning is valued as highly as correct answers
- Pupils feel safe to express incomplete or uncertain ideas
- The goal is collective understanding rather than individual performance

The BSRLM (British Society for Research into Learning Mathematics) has documented how schools focusing on oracy, including think-pair-share approaches in mathematics, can make pedagogy more visible to learners and potentially reduce gaps in achievement between children from different socio-economic groups.

## Progression Across Key Stages

### Early Years Foundation Stage

In the EYFS, mathematical talk focuses on:

**Vocabulary Development**: Introducing mathematical vocabulary through play and practical activities, with emphasis on comparative language (more, less, bigger, smaller) and number names.

**Narrating Thinking**: Teachers model mathematical thinking through think-alouds, demonstrating how to verbalise reasoning.

**Encouraging Description**: Prompting children to describe what they are doing and what they notice, building the foundation for later mathematical explanation.

Ground rules for talk are introduced in simple, accessible forms, with emphasis on taking turns and listening to friends.

### Key Stage 1

In Key Stage 1, pupils develop:

**Full Sentence Responses**: The expectation that pupils respond in full sentences becomes established, with teachers providing scaffolds such as sentence starters.

**Explanation of Method**: Pupils begin to explain how they solved problems, not just what the answer is.

**Agreement and Disagreement**: Pupils learn to agree and disagree respectfully, using structures such as "I agree because..." and "I disagree because..."

Introduction to ground rules for talk continues, with pupils beginning to reflect on the quality of their collaborative work.

### Key Stage 2

In Key Stage 2, pupils develop more sophisticated capabilities:

**Generalisation**: Pupils use talk to identify patterns and make generalisations, supported by stems such as "This always works because..."

**Proof and Justification**: Mathematical talk moves towards more formal justification, with pupils learning to construct chains of reasoning.

**Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Pupils work in groups on complex problems, using exploratory talk to share and refine strategies.

**Critical Engagement**: Pupils learn to critique each other's reasoning constructively, building on strengths and identifying areas for improvement.

By the end of Key Stage 2, pupils should be confident mathematical communicators, able to articulate their reasoning, engage with others' ideas, and use talk as a tool for learning.

## Common Misconceptions and How to Address Them

### Misconception: Talk is Just for English Lessons

Some pupils (and teachers) may view talk as primarily the domain of English lessons rather than mathematics. Addressing this requires:

- Explicitly teaching the value of mathematical talk
- Highlighting examples of mathematicians discussing and collaborating
- Demonstrating how talk supports problem-solving
- Making mathematical discussion a regular, non-negotiable feature of lessons

### Misconception: Only Correct Answers Should Be Shared

Pupils may believe that only correct answers are worth sharing, leading to reluctance to participate. Teachers can address this by:

- Valuing the reasoning process as highly as the answer
- Highlighting the learning value of mistakes
- Using prompts such as "Who else was thinking something similar?" to validate partial understanding
- Celebrating "good mistakes" that reveal important mathematical ideas

### Misconception: Quiet Pupils Are Not Learning

Teachers may interpret silence as lack of engagement or understanding. However, some pupils may be thinking deeply but require more support to articulate their ideas. Strategies include:

- Using think-pair-share to provide rehearsal time
- Offering sentence stems that structure responses
- Using mini-whiteboards for private responses before public sharing
- Valuing written contributions as well as oral ones

### Misconception: More Talk Equals Better Learning

Not all talk is equally valuable. Teachers should be alert to:

- **Off-task talk**: Pupils discussing matters unrelated to mathematics
- **Procedural talk**: Pupils focusing on organisational matters rather than mathematical ideas
- **Dominant voices**: Some pupils monopolising discussion while others remain silent

Regular reflection on the quality of talk, using audio or video recording where appropriate, helps teachers and pupils develop awareness of these issues.

## Assessment of Mathematical Talk

### Formative Assessment Through Talk

Mathematical talk provides rich opportunities for formative assessment. By listening to pupils' discussions, teachers can:

**Identify Misconceptions**: Pupils often reveal partial or incorrect understanding through their attempts to explain their thinking. These revelations are valuable for informing subsequent teaching.

**Assess Reasoning**: Talk reveals the depth of pupils' reasoning in ways that written work may not. Teachers can probe understanding and assess whether pupils can justify their conclusions.

**Monitor Vocabulary Development**: Listening to pupils' use of mathematical vocabulary provides insight into their developing fluency with mathematical language.

**Evaluate Collaborative Skills**: Observation of group talk reveals how well pupils are developing the ability to work mathematically with others.

### Strategies for Assessment

**Eavesdropping**: During pair or group work, teachers circulate and listen to conversations, noting significant contributions, misconceptions, and examples to share with the whole class.

**Targeted Observation**: Teachers focus attention on specific pupils or groups during a lesson, gathering detailed information about their participation and understanding.

**Recording and Review**: Audio or video recording of group work, followed by review with pupils, supports metacognitive reflection and provides evidence for assessment.

**Pupil Self-Assessment**: Pupils can use simple rubrics to evaluate their own participation in mathematical talk, setting targets for improvement.
