# Variation Theory in Mathematics Education

## Overview

Variation theory is a powerful pedagogical approach that has gained significant traction in UK mathematics education through the Teaching for Mastery programme. Originating from the work of Professor Gu Lingyuan in Shanghai during the 1980s and 1990s, and later developed in conjunction with Ference Marton's variation theory of learning, this approach emphasises **carefully controlled variation** to help pupils discern essential mathematical features and relationships.

The central tenet of variation theory is that **learning involves discerning specific features of a phenomenon**, and that variation is a necessary condition for such discernment to occur. By systematically varying certain aspects of a mathematical task whilst keeping others constant, teachers can direct pupils' attention toward critical mathematical structures and relationships.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Gu Lingyuan and the Qingpu Experiment

Professor Gu Lingyuan, working at the Shanghai Academy of Educational Sciences, conducted a landmark longitudinal study in the Qingpu region during the 1980s and 1990s. This research identified two distinct types of variation used by expert Chinese mathematics teachers:

1. **Conceptual variation** – varying the representation of a concept to reveal its essential properties
2. **Procedural variation** – varying the steps or methods to achieve a learning objective

Gu's work, published in *Learning to Teach* (1991) and developed with Rongjin Huang and Ference Marton (Gu, Huang & Marton, 2004), demonstrated how indigenous Chinese teaching approaches could be systematised and studied empirically. The research showed that lessons designed using variation principles produced significantly better learning outcomes than conventional instruction.

### Ference Marton's Variation Theory of Learning

Working independently at Gothenburg University, Ference Marton developed a complementary theoretical framework. Marton's variation theory posits that:

- **Seeing differences precedes seeing sameness** – learners must experience variation in a phenomenon before they can identify its invariant properties
- **Discernment is necessary for learning** – we cannot learn what we have not had the opportunity to experience as different from something else
- **Simultaneous variation** – learners benefit from experiencing multiple examples simultaneously to compare and contrast

The convergence of Gu's practical teaching wisdom with Marton's phenomenographic research created a robust theoretical and practical foundation for variation theory in mathematics education.

## Conceptual Variation

### Definition and Purpose

Conceptual variation involves presenting a mathematical concept in multiple forms to help pupils understand **what it is** (standard and non-standard examples) and **what it is not** (counter-examples). The goal is to reveal the essential features of a concept by varying its non-essential features.

As the NCETM (2020) guidance states: "The central idea of teaching with variation is to highlight the essential features of a concept or idea through varying the non-essential features."

### Types of Conceptual Variation

#### 1. Standard and Non-Standard Examples

Standard examples are the typical, textbook representations of a concept. Non-standard examples present the same concept in unusual or unexpected ways, requiring pupils to identify the underlying structure despite surface differences.

**Example: Representing Fractions**
- Standard: A circle divided into quarters with one quarter shaded
- Non-standard: A set of 12 objects with 3 shaded (representing 3/12 or 1/4)
- Non-standard: A number line showing 0 to 1 with a point at 0.25
- Non-standard: A rectangle divided into 8 equal parts with 2 parts shaded

Pupils who have only seen circles divided into sectors may struggle to recognise fractions in other contexts. Conceptual variation builds flexibility of understanding.

#### 2. Counter-Examples (What It Is Not)

Deliberately presenting non-examples that share some but not all features of a concept helps clarify boundaries.

**Example: Quadrilaterals**
- A shape with four sides but non-straight edges (not a polygon)
- A shape with four straight sides but not closed (not a polygon)
- A shape with four straight sides, closed, but with a reflex angle (still a quadrilateral)

#### 3. Multiple Representations

The same mathematical idea can be represented symbolically, visually, verbally, and contextually.

**Example: Multiplication as Repeated Addition**
- Symbolic: 4 × 3 = 12
- Visual: An array of 4 rows and 3 columns
- Verbal: "Four groups of three"
- Contextual: "Four packets with three biscuits each"
- Number line: Four jumps of 3 from 0

## Procedural Variation

### Definition and Purpose

Procedural variation involves carefully sequenced sets of questions or tasks where **systematic changes reveal mathematical structures**. Unlike repetitive mechanical practice, procedural variation creates "intelligent practice" where pupils must engage with mathematical relationships to complete the tasks.

The NCETM distinguishes this from mere variety: "Variation is not the same as variety – careful attention needs to be paid to what is varied and what is kept the same."

### Characteristics of Intelligent Practice

1. **Progressive complexity** – each question builds upon the previous one
2. **Mathematical connections** – patterns and relationships become visible
3. **Anticipation** – pupils can predict answers based on emerging patterns
4. **Reflection** – pupils articulate what is changing and what stays the same
5. **Efficiency** – fewer questions are needed because each serves multiple purposes

### Examples of Procedural Variation

#### Example 1: Adding Fractions (KS2/KS3)
Procedural variation might sequence:
- 1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5
- 1/5 + 3/5 = 4/5
- 2/5 + 2/5 = 4/5
- 3/5 + 1/5 = 4/5
- 4/5 + 1/5 = ?
- 1/5 + 4/5 = ?

Pupils notice patterns: the denominator stays constant; the numerators add; when the sum equals the denominator, the result is 1.

#### Example 2: Multiplication and Division Facts (KS2)
A procedural variation sequence:
- 6 × 4 = 24
- 6 × 40 = 240
- 60 × 4 = 240
- 60 × 40 = 2400
- 24 ÷ 4 = 6
- 240 ÷ 4 = 60
- 240 ÷ 40 = 6

This highlights the relationship between multiplication and division and the effect of multiplying/dividing by powers of 10.

#### Example 3: Solving Linear Equations (KS3/KS4)
- x + 3 = 7
- 2x + 3 = 7
- 2x + 3 = 13
- 2x − 3 = 13
- 2x + 3 = x + 7
- 3x + 5 = 2x + 12

Each equation introduces new complexity whilst building on previous structure.

## Variation Theory and Teaching for Mastery

### The Five Big Ideas

The NCETM's Teaching for Mastery programme identifies five core components:

1. **Coherence** – breaking learning into small, connected steps
2. **Representation and Structure** – concrete, pictorial, and abstract representations
3. **Mathematical Thinking** – thinking mathematically, not just calculating
4. **Fluency** – efficiency, accuracy, and flexibility
5. **Variation** – highlighting mathematical structure

### The England-China Exchange

The England-China Teacher Exchange, coordinated by the NCETM since 2014, brought Shanghai teaching methods to English schools. British teachers observed:

- Every lesson included carefully designed variation
- Textbooks structured around variation principles
- Teachers collaborated in lesson study groups
- The pace was slower, with fewer questions but deeper engagement

Professor Gu Lingyuan himself addressed exchange participants.

## Implementing Variation Theory in UK Classrooms

### Lesson Design Principles

1. **Identify the Object of Learning** – What critical concept or procedure?
2. **Design the Variation Space** – What varies? What stays invariant?
3. **Sequence Thoughtfully** – Build complexity gradually

### Practical Strategies

#### The "What's the Same? What's Different?" Routine
Present mathematical objects side-by-side and ask pupils to identify similarities and differences.

**Example:**
```
3 × 4 = 12     3 × 40 = 120     30 × 4 = 120
```

#### Intelligent Practice Worksheets
- Fewer questions overall (6-8 instead of 20)
- Each builds systematically on the previous
- Space for pupils to explain patterns
- Extension questions in new contexts

## Variation Across Key Stages

### Early Years and Key Stage 1

**Conceptual variation for number recognition:**
- The numeral '5'
- Five objects in a line
- Five objects in a dice pattern
- Five on a number line
- Five represented on a Rekenrek

**Procedural variation for number bonds:**
- 2 + 3 = 5
- 3 + 2 = 5
- 5 − 2 = 3
- 5 − 3 = 2
- 2 + ? = 5

### Key Stage 2

**Fractions:**
- Conceptual: Multiple representations of 3/4 (area, set, number line)
- Procedural: 1/4 + 1/4, 1/4 + 2/4, 3/4 − 1/4, 1 − 1/4

**Multiplication:**
- 3 × 4, 3 × 8, 6 × 4, 6 × 8 (doubling patterns)
- 12 × 4, 24 × 2, 48 × 1, 6 × 8 (equivalence)

**Area:**
- Rectangles with area 24: 1×24, 2×12, 3×8, 4×6
- Same perimeter, different area

### Key Stage 3

**Sequences:**
- 2, 4, 6, 8... (linear)
- 2, 4, 8, 16... (exponential)
- 2, 5, 8, 11... (different common difference)

**Equations:** Progressive introduction of negatives, fractions, variables on both sides.

**Geometry:** Transformations keeping the object invariant.

### Key Stage 4

**Quadratic equations:**
- x² = 16, x² − 16 = 0, (x−4)(x+4) = 0 (different forms, same solutions)
- x² − 5x + 6 = 0, x² − 5x − 6 = 0 (varying the constant)

**Trigonometry:** Same angle, different hypotenuse; different angles, same hypotenuse.

**Graphs:** y = x², y = x² + 1, y = (x+1)² (transformations)

## Addressing Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Variation Strategy |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Multiplication always makes bigger | Include × by fractions/decimals < 1 |
| Division always makes smaller | Include ÷ by numbers < 1 |
| Fractions are "parts of one" | Include improper fractions > 1 |
| Decimals are small | Vary magnitude: 0.3, 3.0, 30.0 |
| Perimeter and area related | Same perimeter, different area |
| Letters represent objects | Vary contexts: 3a where a=4, 10, 0.5 |

## Assessment and Feedback Using Variation

### Diagnostic Assessment
Variation sequences reveal understanding depth:
- Can pupils complete the sequence correctly?
- Can they explain the pattern?
- Can they apply to non-standard examples?

### Formative Assessment
- **Correct answers, no pattern recognition** – procedural fluency without depth
- **Pattern recognition, computational errors** – conceptual understanding needs consolidation
- **Unable to continue** – gap requiring intervention

### Feedback Strategies
1. **Reference the pattern** – "What's changing?"
2. **Connect to prior learning**
3. **Use representation** – "Let's draw this"
4. **Encourage prediction** – "What do you think will happen?"

## Key Principles Summary

1. **Variation ≠ Variety** – systematic, purposeful changes, not random examples
2. **Invariant and Variant** – carefully choose what stays the same and what changes
3. **Fewer, Deeper Questions** – intelligent practice over mechanical drill
4. **Pattern Recognition** – help pupils see mathematical structure
5. **Multiple Representations** – concepts shown in varied forms
6. **Progression** – build complexity through systematic variation
