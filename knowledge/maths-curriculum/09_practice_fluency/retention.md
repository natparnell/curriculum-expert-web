# Retrieval and Retention in Mathematics

Retrieval practice, spaced repetition, and low-stakes testing constitute a powerful triad of evidence-based strategies that mathematics teachers can employ to combat forgetting and promote long-term retention of mathematical knowledge. Drawing on decades of research in cognitive science and educational psychology, this guide examines how these approaches can be systematically embedded within mathematics curricula across all key stages.

## The Science of Forgetting and Retrieval

### The Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve

Hermann Ebbinghaus, a German psychologist working in the 1880s, conducted seminal research on memory that remains foundational to modern pedagogy. Through rigorous self-experimentation involving the memorisation of nonsense syllables, Ebbinghaus discovered that memory loss follows a predictable exponential decay pattern now known as the "forgetting curve."

Ebbinghaus demonstrated that learners forget approximately 67% of newly learned material within 24 hours without any review. The most dramatic forgetting occurs immediately after learning, with the curve steeply declining before gradually flattening. However, Ebbinghaus also discovered that each act of retrieval interrupts this decay process. When learners successfully recall information, the subsequent forgetting curve becomes less steep, and retention intervals lengthen dramatically.

This finding has profound implications for mathematics education, where procedural fluency and conceptual understanding require sustained practice over time. Mathematical knowledge that is practised intensively during a single unit but never revisited will largely dissipate within weeks, leaving students unable to draw upon prerequisite knowledge when encountering more advanced topics.

### How Retrieval Strengthens Memory

Retrieval practice operates on the principle that the act of recalling information from long-term memory strengthens the neural pathways associated with that knowledge. This phenomenon, sometimes termed the "testing effect," transforms memory from a passive storage system into an active, reconstructive process.

When students retrieve mathematical facts, procedures, or concepts, they are not merely checking what they know; they are actively reinforcing those memories. Research by Roediger and Karpicke (2006) demonstrated that students who practised retrieval significantly outperformed those who engaged in additional study time, even when the study group spent considerably longer with the material. The effortful act of retrieval appears to create more durable memory traces than passive review.

## Spaced Retrieval Practice

### The Spacing Effect

The spacing effect refers to the well-established finding that distributed practice—spreading learning sessions over time—produces superior long-term retention compared to massed practice (cramming). When mathematical practice is distributed across days or weeks rather than concentrated in a single session, students demonstrate substantially better retention weeks and months later.

Carpenter and Agarwal (2020) note that spaced retrieval practice combines two potent effects: the retrieval effect (actively recalling information) and the spacing effect (distributing practice over time). This combination produces what Pooja Agarwal and Patrice Bain term "power tools for teaching"—simple, implementable strategies that yield disproportionate learning gains.

### Implementing Spaced Practice in Mathematics

Effective spaced practice in mathematics requires intentional curriculum design that builds in systematic revisiting of previously learned content. Rather than treating topics as discrete units that are "covered" and then abandoned, teachers should structure regular opportunities for students to retrieve and apply prior learning.

Tom Sherrington (2019) identifies daily review as one of the most powerful applications of Rosenshine's Principles of Instruction. Beginning mathematics lessons with brief retrieval activities—perhaps four questions drawn from last lesson, last week, last term, and last year—creates a cumulative structure where knowledge is continuously reinforced. This approach aligns with Rosenshine's observation that the most effective teachers spent the first eight minutes of lessons reviewing previously learned material.

The Education Endowment Foundation (2021) recommends low-stakes retrieval activities that "provide a quick way of checking understanding prior to attempting more complex tasks." These might take the form of:

- **Starter quizzes**: Four to six questions covering different timeframes
- **Flashcard drills**: Rapid recall of number facts, formulae, or definitions
- **Brain dumps**: Students write everything they can recall about a topic
- **Whiteboard responses**: Whole-class immediate feedback on retrieval questions

### Optimal Spacing Intervals

Research suggests that spacing intervals should gradually increase as mastery develops. Initial retrieval might occur within 24 hours of first learning, followed by intervals of several days, then weeks, and eventually months. This expanding retrieval schedule mirrors how memories consolidate: more frequent practice is needed when knowledge is new, while well-established memories can be maintained with increasingly spaced retrieval opportunities.

Cepeda et al. (2006) found that the optimal gap between study sessions depends on the desired retention interval. For mathematics content that students will need to retain for examinations months away, spacing intervals of several weeks may be most effective. However, the practical constraints of school timetables often necessitate a compromise between theoretical optima and implementable schedules.

## Low-Stakes Testing

### Defining Low-Stakes Assessment

Low-stakes testing refers to retrieval activities where the primary purpose is learning rather than evaluation. Unlike high-stakes examinations that carry significant consequences and induce anxiety, low-stakes quizzes and retrieval exercises focus on practising recall in a supportive, formative environment.

Craig Barton (2018) emphasises that "both multiple-choice questioning and short form skill-based questions are ideal to use in the classroom for regular low-stakes testing." The format matters less than the function: providing students with repeated opportunities to retrieve information from memory without the pressure of performance evaluation.

### Benefits of Low-Stakes Testing

The benefits of low-stakes testing extend beyond mere retention. Regular retrieval practice:

1. **Identifies gaps in understanding**: When students struggle to retrieve specific knowledge, they become aware of areas requiring further study
2. **Improves metacognitive accuracy**: Students develop more realistic assessments of their own learning
3. **Reduces test anxiety**: Familiarity with retrieval processes makes high-stakes assessments less threatening
4. **Provides diagnostic information**: Teachers gain insight into which concepts have been retained and which require reteaching
5. **Promotes transfer**: Regular retrieval of mathematical procedures in varied contexts supports flexible application

### Design Principles for Low-Stakes Tests

Effective low-stakes tests in mathematics should be brief, frequent, and focused on core knowledge. Colleen Young (2019) recommends structuring retrieval practice around "basic facts and the revisiting of prior learning through deeper thinking tasks." This dual focus ensures that students maintain both procedural fluency and conceptual understanding.

Key design principles include:

- **Interleaving**: Mixing different problem types rather than blocking by topic
- **Cumulative structure**: Including questions from current and previous units
- **Appropriate difficulty**: Questions should be challenging but achievable
- **Immediate feedback**: Correcting misconceptions promptly to prevent consolidation of errors
- **Minimal grading**: Reducing emphasis on scores to maintain focus on learning

The Mathematics Mastery programme developed by the Ark curriculum emphasises that "spaced practice and retrieval take place systematically (linked to recall and application of basic facts and the revisiting of prior learning through deeper thinking tasks)." This systematic approach ensures that retrieval becomes embedded in the fabric of mathematics lessons rather than an add-on activity.

## Interleaving and Mixed Practice

### Interleaving Versus Blocking

Traditional mathematics instruction often employs blocked practice, where students work through multiple problems of the same type before moving to a different topic. While this approach produces rapid gains in immediate performance, research by Doug Rohrer and colleagues demonstrates that interleaved practice—mixing different problem types—produces superior long-term retention and transfer.

Interleaving requires students to identify which strategy or procedure is appropriate for each problem, a process that mimics the demands of real-world mathematics and high-stakes assessments. Rohrer, Dedrick, and Stershic (2015) found that interleaved practice improved mathematics learning substantially, with effect sizes that would typically be considered educationally significant.

### Mechanisms of Interleaving

Several mechanisms explain why interleaving enhances learning:

1. **Discriminative contrast**: Working on different problem types highlights the distinctive features of each, helping students distinguish between similar procedures
2. **Retrieval from long-term memory**: Each new problem type requires students to retrieve the appropriate strategy from memory rather than simply repeating the same procedure
3. **Spacing effect**: Interleaving inherently introduces temporal gaps between practice of the same problem type
4. **Contextual interference**: The slight difficulty created by switching between problem types appears to deepen processing

### Implementing Interleaved Practice

Interleaving can be implemented at various grain sizes within mathematics instruction:

**Lesson-level interleaving**: Within a single lesson, students might alternate between related concepts. For instance, a lesson on area might interleave rectangles, triangles, and parallelograms rather than treating each separately.

**Weekly interleaving**: Homework assignments can deliberately mix problems from recent and earlier topics. Craig Barton (2020) advocates for "mixed-topic retrieval practice" as a core component of mathematics homework design.

**Assessment interleaving**: Regular low-stakes tests should deliberately sample from across the curriculum, ensuring that students must identify which knowledge is relevant to each question.

The Learning Scientists (2024) note that "when interleaving is incorporated into retrieval practice, students must decide what strategy to use on each problem, which can mimic what they may experience on a standardised test." This alignment between practice conditions and assessment conditions is particularly valuable for examination preparation.

## Addressing Forgetting in the Mathematics Curriculum

### Cumulative Curriculum Design

A curriculum that genuinely addresses forgetting must be cumulative in structure, with explicit plans for revisiting and extending prior learning. Christine Counsell's concept of "curriculum as progression model" is relevant here: the curriculum should be designed as a journey where each step builds upon and reinforces previous steps.

The National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics (NCETM) advocates for teaching for mastery approaches that include "spaced practice and retrieval" as systematic components. This involves mapping not just what will be taught, but when content will be revisited and in what depth.

### Identifying Core Knowledge for Retention

Not all mathematical knowledge requires the same attention to retention. Teachers should identify:

- **Foundational facts and procedures**: Number bonds, times tables, standard algorithms
- **Key concepts**: Place value, equivalence, functional relationships
- **Transferable strategies**: Problem-solving heuristics, mathematical reasoning patterns
- **Prerequisite knowledge**: Content that future learning depends upon

These categories of knowledge warrant the most systematic retrieval practice, as their loss would most significantly impair future mathematical development.

### Common Misconceptions and Retrieval

Retrieval practice offers particular benefits for addressing common mathematical misconceptions. When students retrieve and apply procedures, misconceptions that have developed often become apparent. However, care must be taken to ensure that retrieval practice does not reinforce incorrect methods.

The process of retrieval can actually strengthen misconceptions if students repeatedly practise erroneous procedures. Therefore, low-stakes testing must be coupled with immediate, specific feedback that corrects errors before they become entrenched. Dylan Wiliam's work on formative assessment emphasises that feedback should be designed to improve the learner, not merely to evaluate learning.

## Practical Implementation Strategies

### Retrieval Practice Starters

Many mathematics departments have adopted structured starter activities that embed retrieval practice at the beginning of every lesson. A typical structure might include:

- **Last lesson**: One question on yesterday's content
- **Last week**: One question on content from a week ago
- **Last term**: One question on content from the previous term
- **Last year**: One question on prerequisite knowledge from previous key stages

This "four-question" model, recommended by the EEF and implemented in many Teaching for Mastery schools, ensures systematic spaced practice without requiring extensive lesson time.

### Flashcards and Self-Testing

Flashcards provide a versatile tool for individual retrieval practice. Students can create cards for mathematical facts, formulae, definitions, and procedures, then test themselves using the cards. The physical act of turning a card to check an answer provides immediate feedback.

Digital flashcard systems such as Anki implement spaced repetition algorithms that automatically schedule reviews at optimal intervals. While primarily used for declarative knowledge, these systems can be adapted for mathematical procedures by framing questions appropriately.

### Quizzing and Low-Stakes Testing Programmes

Regular quizzing programmes, perhaps weekly or fortnightly, can provide structured retrieval opportunities. These quizzes should:

- Cover material from across the curriculum
- Be genuinely low-stakes (minimal impact on grades)
- Include a mix of question types and difficulties
- Be followed by immediate feedback and error correction
- Inform future teaching by identifying common areas of difficulty

Colleen Young's presentation "Making Mathematics Stick" (2019) includes practical examples of retrieval questions suitable for mathematics classrooms, developed as part of an NCETM-funded project on questioning.

### Homework as Retrieval Practice

Homework can be redesigned to prioritise retrieval over new learning. Rather than assigning questions exclusively on current topics, effective mathematics homework interleaves problems from recent and earlier content. This approach ensures that the spacing effect operates even outside classroom time.

Craig Barton's "Recall, Apply, Challenge" model structures homework around three components: retrieving prior knowledge (recall), applying that knowledge in standard problems (apply), and tackling more demanding problems that require selection and adaptation of strategies (challenge).

## Measuring the Impact of Retrieval Strategies

### Assessment Design

The impact of retrieval practice on long-term retention can be measured through carefully designed assessments. Long-term retention tests administered weeks or months after instruction provide the most valid measures of whether retrieval strategies have been effective.

Teachers should consider:

- **Delayed assessments**: Testing content weeks after it was taught
- **Cumulative examinations**: Assessments that sample broadly from the curriculum
- **Transfer tasks**: Problems that require application of knowledge in novel contexts

### Monitoring Student Progress

Regular low-stakes testing generates rich data on student progress. Teachers can track:

- Individual questions or topics where retrieval is weak
- Patterns of forgetting across different types of content
- The effectiveness of different spacing intervals
- Improvements in retention over time

This data should inform adjustments to retrieval practice schedules and identify areas requiring additional attention.

## Challenges and Considerations

### Time and Curriculum Constraints

Implementing comprehensive retrieval practice requires time, which is always scarce in busy school timetables. However, research suggests that retrieval practice is highly efficient: time spent retrieving produces greater learning gains than equivalent time spent re-studying. The challenge is shifting instructional time from less effective activities to retrieval-based approaches.

### Student Motivation

Some students may initially resist retrieval practice, finding it more effortful than passive review. The immediate feeling of difficulty during retrieval can be misinterpreted as poor learning, when in fact the opposite is true. Teachers should explain the purpose and benefits of retrieval practice to help students embrace the productive struggle it entails.

### Balancing Retrieval with New Learning

While retrieval is essential, it must be balanced against the need to introduce new content. Mathematics curricula are extensive, and time devoted to reviewing prior learning is time not spent on new topics. Effective curriculum design finds the optimal balance, ensuring that new learning builds upon securely retained prior knowledge while maintaining appropriate pace.

## Research Evidence and Further Reading

### Key Studies

The evidence base for retrieval practice in mathematics includes several landmark studies:

- **Roediger and Karpicke (2006)**: Demonstrated the superiority of retrieval practice over repeated studying
- **Rohrer, Dedrick, and Stershic (2015)**: Established the benefits of interleaved mathematics practice
- **Agarwal, Bain, and Chamberlain (2012)**: Showed that retrieval practice benefits diverse student populations
- **May (2021)**: Investigated effects of spaced retrieval on mathematical reasoning in pre-service teachers

### Professional Resources

Teachers seeking to implement retrieval practice can draw on several excellent resources:

## Conclusion

Retrieval practice, spaced repetition, and low-stakes testing represent evidence-based strategies that mathematics teachers can employ to combat the natural process of forgetting and promote durable learning. By systematically incorporating these approaches into curriculum design and daily instruction, teachers can help students build mathematical knowledge that endures beyond the immediate lesson and transfers to new contexts.

The implementation of these strategies requires intentional planning and a shift in instructional time allocation. However, the research evidence is clear: the modest investment required to embed retrieval practice yields substantial returns in terms of long-term retention and mathematical fluency. As Rosenshine observed, the most effective teachers are those who regularly require students to retrieve and apply previously learned material—a principle as relevant to mathematics classrooms today as it was decades ago.
