# Modern Foreign Languages in the Early Years Foundation Stage

## Introduction: The Non-Statutory Context

Unlike Key Stage 2, where the study of a modern foreign language is statutory, the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) does not include modern foreign languages (MFL) as a requirement within its statutory framework. However, this absence from statutory documentation does not diminish the potential value of early language exposure. Indeed, the EYFS provides a rich context within which foundational language learning attitudes and dispositions can be nurtured, particularly through the Communication and Language and Understanding the World areas of learning.

The EYFS statutory framework recognises that for children whose home language is not English, providers must take reasonable steps to provide opportunities for children to develop and use their home language in play and learning, supporting their development in English. This commitment to multilingualism creates a natural context within which additional language exposure can be integrated, celebrating linguistic diversity and fostering positive attitudes towards languages from the earliest years.

This document explores the non-statutory provision for modern foreign languages within the EYFS, examining the developmental appropriateness of early language exposure, the connections to Communication and Language development, the research evidence supporting early multilingual experiences, and practical strategies for integrating language awareness into early years provision.

## The EYFS Framework and Language Learning

### Statutory Requirements Related to Language

While modern foreign languages are not a statutory requirement within the EYFS, the framework contains several provisions that create opportunities for language learning and multilingual experiences:

**English as an Additional Language (EAL):**
The EYFS statutory framework explicitly addresses children whose home language is not English, requiring that providers take reasonable steps to provide opportunities for children to continue developing and using their home language in play and learning. Simultaneously, providers must ensure that children have sufficient opportunities to learn and reach a good standard in English language during the EYFS, preparing them for Year 1 and the National Curriculum programmes of study.

This dual focus—valuing home languages while developing English proficiency—creates a natural context for celebrating multilingualism. Settings that support home language maintenance inherently foster positive attitudes towards linguistic diversity, which provides a foundation for future MFL learning.

**Communication and Language:**
As one of the three prime areas of learning, Communication and Language occupies a central position in the EYFS. The Early Learning Goals for Communication and Language focus on:

- **Listening, Attention and Understanding:** Children listen carefully and respond appropriately in a range of situations
- **Speaking:** Children express themselves effectively, showing awareness of listeners' needs

These foundational communication skills are transferable across languages. Research suggests that metalinguistic awareness—the ability to reflect on and analyse language—develops through multilingual experiences and supports overall language development.

### Areas of Learning Supporting Language Development

**Understanding the World:**
The Understanding the World area of learning includes the Natural World strand, which encompasses exploration of the world around children. This provides opportunities to introduce children to the concept that people in different places speak different languages, fostering early geographical and cultural awareness that underpins later MFL study.

**Personal, Social and Emotional Development:**
This prime area includes developing self-confidence and self-awareness, and managing feelings and behaviour. Learning about different languages and cultures supports children's developing sense of identity and their awareness of others, contributing to the British values of mutual respect and tolerance.

**Expressive Arts and Design:**
This specific area provides rich opportunities for language exposure through songs, rhymes, and stories from different cultures. Musical and rhythmic elements of language can be explored through singing games and action songs in various languages.

## Developmental Appropriateness of Early Language Exposure

### The Critical Period Hypothesis and Early Childhood

Research into language acquisition has long debated the existence of a "critical period" for language learning—a window during which language acquisition occurs naturally and efficiently. While the evidence for a sharply defined critical period is contested, research consistently demonstrates that young children possess remarkable capacities for language learning:

**Phonological Sensitivity:**
Young children are particularly attuned to the sounds of language. Research indicates that infants can discriminate between phonemes from all languages at birth, but this ability narrows by around 12 months as they become specialised in the sounds of their native language(s). Early exposure to the sounds of additional languages, even in limited contexts, can help maintain this phonological flexibility.

**Implicit Learning:**
Young children learn language implicitly through exposure and interaction, rather than through explicit instruction. This natural learning mechanism means that brief, play-based encounters with additional languages can be absorbed without the cognitive burden that formal learning might impose.

**Neuroplasticity:**
The early years represent a period of significant neuroplasticity, with the brain particularly receptive to forming new neural connections. Multilingual experiences during this period contribute to cognitive flexibility and executive function development.

### Cognitive Benefits of Multilingual Exposure

Research into bilingualism and early multilingual exposure has identified several cognitive benefits that extend beyond language proficiency:

**Executive Function Development:**
Multilingual children often demonstrate enhanced executive function skills, including attention control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility. Managing multiple languages requires the brain to inhibit one language system while activating another, strengthening cognitive control mechanisms.

**Metalinguistic Awareness:**
Exposure to multiple languages supports the development of metalinguistic awareness—the ability to think about language as an object of study. Children who experience linguistic diversity become aware that objects can have multiple labels, that languages have different structures, and that communication can occur through various means.

**Perspective-Taking:**
Research suggests that multilingual exposure supports theory of mind development—the understanding that others have different thoughts, beliefs, and perspectives. This social cognition skill underpins successful communication and relationships.

**Critical Thinking:**
Studies have linked multilingualism to enhanced critical thinking abilities. The cognitive flexibility developed through managing multiple linguistic systems appears to transfer to other domains of reasoning and problem-solving.

### Considerations for Developmental Appropriateness

While early language exposure offers benefits, it must be implemented with sensitivity to children's developmental needs:

**Play-Based Approaches:**
Effective early language exposure occurs through play, songs, stories, and everyday routines rather than formal instruction. Young children learn language best when they are actively engaged, motivated by intrinsic interest, and supported by meaningful context.

**Emotional Security:**
For children learning English as an additional language, the priority must be emotional security and the development of a strong foundation in their home language. Additional language exposure should never compromise children's sense of safety or their ability to communicate their needs.

**Individual Variation:**
Children vary significantly in their language development trajectories. Some children may enthusiastically embrace new languages, while others may be more hesitant. Provision should respect individual differences and avoid pressure.

**Integration with First Language Development:**
Research consistently shows that a strong foundation in a first language supports, rather than hinders, additional language development. Cognitive and linguistic skills transfer across languages, meaning that children who develop strong vocabulary and grammatical understanding in their home language are better positioned to learn additional languages.

## Communication and Language: Links to MFL Development

### The Prime Area of Communication and Language

The Communication and Language prime area provides the foundation for all future language learning, including modern foreign languages. The three Early Learning Goals within this area each contribute to MFL readiness:

**Listening, Attention and Understanding:**
- Children listen carefully in a range of situations
- Children respond appropriately to what they hear
- Children follow instructions involving several ideas or actions

These listening skills are fundamental to all language learning. Children who develop strong listening skills in the EYFS are better prepared to attend to the sounds and patterns of additional languages later.

**Speaking:**
- Children express themselves effectively
- Children use past, present and future forms accurately
- Children develop their own narratives and explanations

The development of spoken language confidence and competence in the EYFS creates the foundation for oral participation in MFL lessons. Children who are accustomed to expressing themselves verbally are more likely to engage in speaking activities in a new language.

**Vocabulary Development:**
While not a separate Early Learning Goal, vocabulary development is emphasised throughout the Communication and Language area. Research consistently shows that vocabulary size in early childhood predicts later academic success, including language learning outcomes.

### Oracy and MFL Readiness

The oracy skills developed through the EYFS prime areas directly support later MFL learning:

**Phonological Awareness:**
Developing awareness of the sounds of language—rhyme, alliteration, syllables—supports later pronunciation and phonics learning in additional languages. EYFS activities such as nursery rhymes, sound games, and listening walks develop these foundational skills.

**Turn-Taking and Interaction:**
The conversational skills developed through EYFS provision—taking turns, listening to others, responding appropriately—are prerequisites for communicative language teaching approaches used in primary MFL.

**Storytelling and Narrative:**
Engagement with stories in the EYFS develops narrative understanding and vocabulary that supports comprehension of foreign language texts. Children who are familiar with story structures can apply this knowledge to understand stories in unfamiliar languages.

### Supporting EAL Children

For children learning English as an additional language, the EYFS provides crucial support that has implications for later MFL learning:

**Home Language Valuation:**
The EYFS requirement to support home language development sends a powerful message about the value of multilingualism. Children who see their home language respected and used in the setting develop positive attitudes towards linguistic diversity that support future language learning.

**Visual and Contextual Support:**
EYFS practice emphasises visual support, real objects, and meaningful context to support language comprehension. These strategies, essential for EAL support, are equally applicable to early foreign language exposure.

**Gradual Progression:**
The EYFS approach to language development—moving from single words to phrases to sentences—mirrors the progression appropriate for early foreign language learning.

## Early Language Exposure: Approaches and Strategies

### Non-Statutory Provision for MFL in the EYFS

While MFL is not statutory in the EYFS, many settings choose to introduce children to additional languages through various approaches:

**Language Awareness Activities:**
Rather than formal language teaching, many settings focus on language awareness—helping children recognise that different languages exist, that people communicate in different ways, and that linguistic diversity is valuable. Activities might include:
- Celebrating "hello" in different languages
- Exploring how the same object has different names in different languages
- Listening to stories and songs in various languages
- Meeting speakers of different languages

**Embedding Language in Daily Routines:**
Some settings integrate simple foreign language elements into daily routines:
- Greetings and farewells
- Counting during tidy-up time
- Colour vocabulary during art activities
- Food vocabulary during snack time

This incidental exposure introduces children to the sounds and patterns of additional languages without the pressure of formal learning.

**Specialist Language Sessions:**
Some settings, particularly those with language specialists or connections to language teachers, offer structured language sessions. These typically use playful, interactive approaches:
- Action songs and rhymes
- Games and playful activities
- Stories with repetition and visual support
- Simple role-play and puppetry

**Peer and Community Languages:**
Settings with linguistically diverse populations can leverage the languages present in their community:
- Inviting family members to share their languages
- Creating displays celebrating the languages spoken by children and families
- Using peer language experts to teach simple phrases
- Building partnerships with complementary schools

### Pedagogical Principles for Early Language Exposure

Research and practice suggest several principles for effective early language exposure:

**Meaningful Context:**
Language should be encountered in meaningful contexts where comprehension is supported by visual cues, actions, and familiar routines. Abstract vocabulary lists are developmentally inappropriate for young children.

**Multi-Sensory Engagement:**
Young children learn through their senses. Effective early language activities engage multiple senses—songs for auditory learning, actions for kinaesthetic learning, props and pictures for visual learning.

**Repetition and Routine:**
Young children benefit from repetition and predictable structures. Regular routines that incorporate language elements—daily greetings, counting songs, weather reports—allow children to gradually join in and anticipate language.

**Play-Based Learning:**
Play is the primary mode of learning for young children. Language exposure should occur through play activities—role-play areas, small world play, puppet shows—where language serves a communicative purpose.

**Enjoyment and Motivation:**
Early language experiences should be enjoyable and stress-free. The goal is not mastery but positive associations with languages and cultures. Children who enjoy early language activities are more likely to approach later formal language learning with enthusiasm.

**Respect for Home Languages:**
Any additional language provision must be implemented in ways that value and respect children's home languages. Families should be consulted and involved in decisions about language exposure.

## Transition to Year 1: Preparing for Formal MFL

### The Transition from EYFS to National Curriculum

The transition from the EYFS to Year 1 represents a significant shift in educational approach, with implications for language learning:

**From Non-Statutory to Statutory:**
While MFL remains non-statutory at Key Stage 1 (Years 1 and 2), schools have the option to teach languages. By Key Stage 2 (Year 3 onwards), the study of a modern foreign language becomes statutory. The experiences children have in the EYFS can influence their readiness and enthusiasm for this formal requirement.

**From Play-Based to Structured Learning:**
Year 1 typically sees increased structure and formality compared to the EYFS. Children who have experienced playful, incidental language exposure in the early years may be better prepared for the more structured approaches of primary MFL.

**Developing Learning Behaviours:**
The learning behaviours developed in the EYFS—concentration, collaboration, curiosity—support success in all areas of the curriculum, including MFL. The Characteristics of Effective Teaching and Learning particularly support language learning:
- **Playing and Exploring:** Trying new experiences and learning by trial and error
- **Active Learning:** Maintaining focus and persevering with challenges
- **Creating and Thinking Critically:** Developing ideas and making links between experiences

### Building Foundations for KS2 MFL

While formal MFL teaching is not required until KS2, the EYFS can lay important foundations:

**Positive Attitudes:**
Perhaps the most important outcome of early language exposure is the development of positive attitudes towards languages and language learning. Children who have enjoyed songs, stories, and games in other languages are more likely to approach formal MFL with enthusiasm.

**Phonological Readiness:**
Exposure to the sounds of different languages supports phonological awareness and can make children more attuned to the sound systems they will encounter in formal MFL teaching.

**Cultural Awareness:**
Early exposure to different languages often goes hand-in-hand with cultural awareness. Understanding that people in different places live differently and speak differently supports the intercultural understanding that is part of the MFL curriculum.

**Metalinguistic Awareness:**
Even limited exposure to multiple languages can help children develop awareness of language as a system—understanding that words represent concepts, that languages have rules, and that communication can occur in different ways.

### Supporting Smooth Transitions

Settings can support smooth transitions in relation to language learning:

**Communication Between Settings:**
Sharing information about children's language experiences, interests, and any additional languages spoken at home helps receiving schools build on existing foundations.

**Familiarisation with KS2 MFL:**
Where possible, EYFS settings can familiarise children with the language they will study at KS2. This might involve:
- Identifying the language taught at the receiving school
- Introducing basic greetings and songs in that language
- Discussing what language learning will be like in "big school"

**Involving Families:**
Families play a crucial role in supporting language learning. Settings can:
- Share information about the benefits of early language exposure
- Provide ideas for supporting language development at home
- Involve families in celebrating linguistic diversity

## Research Evidence and Professional Guidance

### Key Research Findings

Research into early language learning and multilingualism provides important guidance for EYFS practice:

**Early Exposure Benefits:**
Studies indicate that early exposure to multiple languages supports cognitive development, metalinguistic awareness, and positive attitudes towards linguistic diversity. However, the benefits depend on the quality of exposure and the approach taken.

**Home Language Priority:**
Research consistently shows that maintaining and developing the home language supports, rather than hinders, additional language development. The EYFS emphasis on home language support aligns with this evidence base.

**Quality Over Quantity:**
When it comes to early language exposure, quality matters more than quantity. Brief, enjoyable, meaningful encounters with additional languages can be more beneficial than extended formal instruction that exceeds children's developmental readiness.

**Individual Differences:**
Children vary significantly in their language learning trajectories and their responses to additional language exposure. Research supports flexible, responsive approaches that respect individual differences.

**Long-Term Outcomes:**
While early exposure to languages does not guarantee long-term proficiency, it can influence motivation, attitudes, and readiness for formal language learning. These affective factors significantly impact language learning success.

### Professional Guidance and Resources

Several organisations provide guidance relevant to MFL in the early years:

**The British Council:**
The British Council's Language Trends research and primary language resources, while focused on Key Stage 2, provide relevant context for understanding the progression from early years to primary language learning.

**NALDIC (National Association for Language Development in the Curriculum):**
NALDIC provides extensive guidance on supporting children with EAL, including resources specifically for the early years. While focused on English language development, many principles apply to additional language exposure.

**Early Education:**
This organisation provides resources and training on supporting communication and language development, including guidance on multilingualism in the early years.

**The Association for Language Learning (ALL):**
ALL provides resources and support for primary language teachers, including guidance on transition from early years to Key Stage 2.

## Practical Implementation: Recommendations for Settings

### Creating a Language-Rich Environment

Settings can create environments that support language development and celebrate linguistic diversity:

**Visual Environment:**
- Display greetings in multiple languages
- Label objects in home languages and English
- Create displays celebrating the languages spoken by children and families
- Use multilingual signage and visual timetables

**Resources:**
- Stock the book corner with dual-language books and books in languages spoken by children
- Include music and songs from various cultures
- Provide props and small world figures representing diverse cultures

**Routines:**
- Incorporate simple greetings in different languages into daily routines
- Use counting songs in various languages during transitions
- Celebrate multilingualism as part of the setting's culture

### Working with Families

Families are essential partners in supporting early language development:

**Valuing Home Languages:**
- Ask families about the languages spoken at home
- Display welcome signs in all home languages
- Invite family members to share songs, stories, and words from their languages
- Ensure that home language development is seen as valuable, not a problem to be solved

**Supporting Multilingual Development:**
- Share information about how learning multiple languages benefits children
- Provide practical ideas for supporting language development at home
- Connect families with community language schools or resources

**Communication:**
- Use translation services or bilingual staff to communicate effectively with all families
- Share observations about children's language development
- Involve families in planning for children's language learning

### Assessment and Observation

The EYFS Profile does not require specific assessment of additional languages, but practitioners should observe and note:

- Children's responses to language exposure activities
- Children's growing awareness of linguistic diversity
- The development of communication skills in all languages spoken
- Children's confidence and enjoyment in language-related activities

Observations can inform planning and ensure that provision meets individual needs.

## Conclusion: Laying Foundations for Lifelong Language Learning

While modern foreign languages are not a statutory requirement within the EYFS, the early years represent a crucial period for laying the foundations for future language learning. The experiences children have during their early years—whether through formal language exposure or through the celebration of linguistic diversity in their setting—shape their attitudes towards languages and their readiness for formal study.

The EYFS commitment to supporting children with English as an additional language creates a natural context for valuing multilingualism. When settings actively celebrate the languages children speak at home and provide opportunities for all children to encounter different languages, they foster positive attitudes towards linguistic diversity that support future language learning.

Key principles for early years language provision include:

- **Respecting home languages:** Supporting home language development as the foundation for all future language learning
- **Creating positive associations:** Ensuring that early encounters with languages are enjoyable and stress-free
- **Making meaning central:** Embedding language in meaningful contexts rather than teaching abstract vocabulary
- **Building on existing provision:** Integrating language exposure into the prime areas of learning, particularly Communication and Language
- **Preparing for transition:** Helping children develop the skills and attitudes that will support success at Key Stage 2

The ultimate goal is not to produce young children who can speak multiple languages fluently—an unrealistic expectation given the non-statutory nature of provision. Rather, the goal is to nurture children who are curious about languages, confident in their own linguistic abilities, and ready to embrace the formal language learning they will encounter at Key Stage 2 and beyond.

By approaching language as a source of joy, discovery, and connection, early years settings can play a vital role in preparing children to be successful, enthusiastic language learners throughout their lives. The foundations laid in the EYFS—positive attitudes, phonological awareness, cultural curiosity, and metalinguistic understanding—support not just language learning but children's overall cognitive and social development, equipping them to thrive in an increasingly interconnected, multilingual world.
