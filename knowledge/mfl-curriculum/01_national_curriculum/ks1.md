# Key Stage 1: Non-Statutory MFL Provision

## Overview

Modern Foreign Languages (MFL) holds a unique position within the English national curriculum at Key Stage 1 (KS1). Unlike at Key Stage 2, where languages become a statutory requirement from Year 3, KS1 provision remains entirely optional and non-statutory. This chapter examines the legal framework governing this phase, the rationale for early language exposure, practical approaches for implementation, and the rich potential for cross-curricular integration that makes KS1 language learning valuable despite its non-compulsory status.

## Legal and Policy Framework

### Statutory Position

The Department for Education (DfE) makes explicit in the national curriculum framework that languages are not a compulsory subject at Key Stage 1. The statutory programmes of study for languages apply only to Key Stages 2 and 3, with Key Stage 2 mandatory provision beginning in Year 3. This policy position reflects a deliberate decision to prioritise foundational literacy and numeracy during the early primary years whilst leaving flexibility for schools to introduce languages where capacity and inclination exist.

However, the absence of statutory obligation does not equate to absence of value. The DfE's languages programmes of study document acknowledges that "teaching may be of any modern or ancient foreign language" and that the focus should be on "enabling pupils to make substantial progress in one language." Schools introducing languages at KS1 should therefore consider continuity with KS2 provision, ensuring that early exposure lays groundwork for subsequent formal study.

### The 2014 National Curriculum Context

The 2014 national curriculum reforms maintained the position established in earlier frameworks regarding KS1 languages. The accompanying framework document states that all schools must teach the national curriculum to pupils of compulsory school age, but specifies that the programmes of study for languages apply only from Key Stage 2. This creates a clear demarcation: Years 1 and 2 (ages 5-7) sit outside statutory language requirements, whilst Years 3-6 (ages 7-11) fall within them.

### Academy and Free School Flexibility

Academies and free schools, whilst not bound by the national curriculum in its entirety, typically follow its programmes of study as a benchmark for curriculum quality. These schools enjoy greater freedom regarding KS1 languages, with some choosing to embed substantial foreign language provision and others opting to focus resources elsewhere. The decision often reflects leadership priorities, staff expertise, and community expectations rather than regulatory requirements.

## Rationale for Early Language Exposure

### Cognitive Development Benefits

Research consistently demonstrates that early childhood represents a critical period for language acquisition. Young children's brains demonstrate remarkable plasticity, enabling them to absorb pronunciation patterns, intonation, and grammatical structures with an ease that diminishes with age. Dr. Patricia Kuhl's research at the University of Washington demonstrates that infants possess the ability to discriminate between all phonetic contrasts found in world languages, a capacity that narrows as children specialise in their native tongue's sound system.

Exposure to foreign languages during the KS1 years capitalises on this neurological readiness. Children aged 5-7 remain within what linguists term the "sensitive period" for language learning, demonstrating enhanced ability to acquire native-like pronunciation and intuitive grasp of grammatical patterns. Even informal exposure through songs, games, and stories contributes to the development of phonological awareness that supports both foreign language learning and first language literacy.

### Confidence and Attitude Formation

KS1 children characteristically approach language learning without the self-consciousness that often affects older learners. They are uninhibited in mimicking unfamiliar sounds, willing to experiment with new vocabulary, and generally demonstrate positive attitudes toward language activities. This natural confidence provides a foundation upon which subsequent formal learning can build.

The primary years, particularly KS1, represent a crucial period for attitude formation regarding languages and language learning. Positive early experiences create a disposition toward linguistic curiosity and cultural openness that influences engagement throughout the educational journey. Conversely, negative experiences or absence of exposure can contribute to the development of anxiety or resistance that impedes later progress.

### Preparation for Statutory KS2 Provision

Schools that introduce languages at KS1 create a valuable bridge to the statutory requirements that follow. Children entering Year 3 with prior exposure to the target language possess foundational vocabulary, familiarity with classroom routines conducted in the language, and established phonological awareness. This preparation enables more rapid progress through the KS2 programme of study, creating space for deeper cultural exploration and more complex linguistic development.

The National Curriculum framework encourages schools to consider continuity between phases. Where KS1 introduction is carefully planned to align with the KS2 curriculum, children benefit from coherent progression rather than restarting their language learning journey in Year 3. This coherence maximises the efficiency of the statutory teaching time available at Key Stage 2.

## Pedagogical Approaches for KS1

### The Narrative Format Approach

Research conducted by McElwee (2015) examined the effectiveness of the Narrative Format approach for preschool and KS1 learners of French in England. This methodology utilises a series of stories focusing on children's common experiences, presented through repetitive, predictable language structures. The approach aligns with how young children naturally acquire their first language—through meaningful contexts, repetition, and emotional engagement with narrative.

In the Narrative Format, teachers present stories using visual support, gesture, and varied intonation to convey meaning without translation. Key vocabulary and phrases recur across multiple story sessions, enabling children to internalise language patterns through exposure rather than explicit instruction. Research findings indicated that children exposed to this approach developed measurable receptive vocabulary and demonstrated ability to comprehend and respond to questions in the target language.

### Songs, Rhymes and Musical Approaches

Songs and rhymes represent perhaps the most widely adopted approach to KS1 language provision. The inherent properties of musical language—rhythm, repetition, predictable structures, and emotional engagement—align closely with how young children learn. Research published in Language Teaching (Cambridge Core, 2023) confirms that UK early years and primary teachers consistently report using songs as a primary pedagogical tool, valuing their accessibility and effectiveness for vocabulary building.

The pedagogical value of songs extends beyond simple vocabulary acquisition. Children engage with the musicality of language, developing phonological awareness through exposure to unfamiliar sound patterns. The rhythmic structure of songs supports memory consolidation, whilst the physical actions that often accompany songs provide kinaesthetic reinforcement of meaning. Traditional songs, as noted by practitioners, frequently offer richer topic vocabulary than contemporary alternatives, making them particularly valuable for curriculum coverage.

Effective song-based pedagogy follows a progression from passive to active participation. Initially, children listen to songs with visual support to establish meaning. Subsequently, they join in with actions, then with repeated chorus lines, gradually building toward independent singing. This progression mirrors natural language acquisition, where comprehension precedes production.

### Storytelling and Picture Books

Storytelling provides a rich context for language exposure that engages children's imagination and emotional engagement. Picture books, whether originally written in the target language or translations of familiar stories, offer visual scaffolding that enables children to follow narrative meaning without understanding every word. The predictability of story structures—beginning, middle, end; character, setting, problem, resolution—provides cognitive support that frees attention for language processing.

Effective storytelling at KS1 employs techniques drawn from Total Physical Response (TPR) methodology. Teachers use exaggerated gesture, varied facial expression, and props to convey meaning. Key phrases are repeated with consistent intonation, enabling children to join in with predictable elements. Post-story activities might include sequencing pictures, acting out scenes, or simple comprehension questions that children answer through gesture or single-word responses.

### Games and Play-Based Learning

Play constitutes the natural medium through which young children engage with the world, and language learning is no exception. Games provide meaningful contexts for language use that feel purposeful to children whilst reducing the anxiety that can accompany more formal learning activities. Simple games—Simon Says, memory matching, treasure hunts, role-play scenarios—embed language within enjoyable, low-pressure contexts.

The desuggestopedia methodology, whilst originally developed for adult learners, informs KS1 practice through its emphasis on creating relaxed, enjoyable learning environments. The principle that learning proceeds most effectively when anxiety is minimised and enjoyment is maximised finds particular resonance with young learners. Teachers create "safe" spaces for experimentation where incorrect attempts are treated as natural steps in learning rather than failures.

### Cross-Curricular Integration

The non-statutory status of KS1 languages enables flexible integration across the curriculum. Rather than occupying discrete timetable slots, language elements can be woven throughout the school day, reinforcing learning in other subjects whilst providing exposure to the target language.

## Cross-Curricular Opportunities

### Literacy and English

The relationship between foreign language learning and first language literacy development is bidirectional and mutually reinforcing. KS1 children developing phonological awareness through foreign language activities strengthen the foundational skills that underpin reading and writing in English. The explicit attention to sound-symbol relationships, syllable structure, and rhyme patterns that characterises effective language teaching directly supports the phonics instruction that dominates KS1 English teaching.

Ofsted's inspection framework evaluates "the extent to which pupils develop a range of skills well, including communication, reading and writing and mathematical skills and how well they apply these across the curriculum." MFL teachers can demonstrate contribution to this agenda through explicit cross-curricular links: comparing sound systems, exploring cognates and word origins, examining grammatical concepts (nouns, verbs, adjectives) that apply across languages, and developing listening skills that transfer to English comprehension.

### Mathematics

Mathematics offers numerous opportunities for cross-curricular language integration. Number work, counting, sequences, and basic operations provide meaningful contexts for number vocabulary and mathematical language. The regular rhythms of mathematics—counting in sequences, reciting times tables—lend themselves to target language adaptation.

Beyond simple counting, mathematics lessons provide contexts for exploring cultural differences in mathematical representation: how numbers are written, the use of decimal points versus commas, different measurement systems (metric versus imperial), and date conventions. These explorations contribute to children's developing understanding of cultural variation whilst embedding mathematical vocabulary.

### Physical Education

Physical Education (PE) provides an ideal context for language integration. PE activities naturally employ imperative forms (commands and instructions), directional language, body part vocabulary, and action verbs. The physical context makes meaning transparent—children understand "sautez" when accompanied by a jumping demonstration in ways that classroom explanation cannot achieve.

Warm-up routines, cool-down activities, and game instructions can all be delivered partially or wholly in the target language. Actions such as touching body parts, moving in directions, or performing specific movements embed vocabulary within meaningful physical experience. The repetitive nature of PE routines enables children to internalise language patterns through consistent exposure.

### Music

The overlap between MFL and music is substantial and mutually reinforcing. Songs, as discussed, represent a primary pedagogical tool for language learning. Conversely, language learning provides content for musical development, offering repertoire that extends beyond the English-language songs that typically dominate primary music.

Musical concepts—rhythm, pitch, tempo, dynamics—can be explored through target language vocabulary. Cultural music traditions provide authentic listening material and performance repertoire. The physical coordination required for action songs supports both musical and motor development.

### Art and Design

Art activities provide contexts for colour vocabulary, shape descriptions, material names, and evaluative language. Instructions for art activities can be delivered in the target language with visual demonstration. Display of artwork can incorporate target language labels and descriptions created by children.

Artistic traditions from countries where the target language is spoken offer cultural learning opportunities. Exploring the work of artists such as Monet (French), Miró (Spanish), or Klee (German) embeds language learning within art history appreciation.

### Understanding the World / Geography

Geographical learning provides rich contexts for language integration. Country names, geographical features, weather vocabulary, and directional language all find natural application in geography lessons. The cultural dimension of language learning aligns with geographical exploration of different countries and regions.

Map work can be conducted using target language vocabulary for directions, countries, and features. Weather monitoring can incorporate daily description in the target language. Comparisons between the local area and target language countries provide authentic contexts for descriptive language use.

## Practical Implementation Models

### The Taster Approach

Some schools choose to provide "taster" experiences rather than systematic language instruction. This model exposes children to multiple languages through celebration events, themed days, or rotation through different languages across the year. While this approach provides cultural awareness and initial exposure, it offers limited linguistic progression and may confuse children who benefit from consistent exposure to a single language system.

The taster model is best suited to schools where staff lack confidence in language teaching or where leadership wishes to raise cultural awareness without committing to systematic language provision. Where tasters are offered, they should be clearly positioned as cultural experiences rather than language learning, avoiding confusion about expectations.

### The Continuity Approach

Schools committed to language provision at KS1 typically adopt a continuity approach, introducing the language that will become statutory at KS2. This might be a single language (most commonly French, Spanish, or German) or, less commonly, a split provision where KS1 introduction differs from the main KS2 language.

The continuity approach enables gradual progression from informal exposure toward formal learning. Year 1 might focus entirely on oral comprehension and spoken response, Year 2 might introduce limited reading of familiar words, and Year 3 builds upon this foundation within the statutory framework. This progression mirrors how children acquire their first language, with comprehension preceding production and oracy preceding literacy.

### The Specialist Teacher Model

Where schools employ specialist MFL teachers—either through direct employment or through peripatetic arrangements—KS1 provision typically takes the form of discrete weekly lessons. These sessions might last 20-30 minutes, appropriate to the attention span of young children, and employ high-energy, multi-sensory approaches that maximise engagement.

The specialist model offers advantages in linguistic accuracy and pedagogical expertise. Specialist teachers possess the subject knowledge to model authentic pronunciation, explain grammatical concepts age-appropriately, and design activities that effectively target language learning objectives. However, this model creates separation between language learning and class teachers' ongoing practice, potentially limiting cross-curricular integration.

### The Class Teacher Integration Model

An alternative model integrates language provision into class teachers' ongoing practice. Class teachers introduce language elements during daily routines, register-taking, classroom commands, and cross-curricular activities. This model maximises exposure time and demonstrates language as a living means of communication rather than a subject confined to specialist lessons.

The integration model requires confidence and willingness from class teachers, many of whom may lack personal language proficiency. Successful implementation typically involves professional development support, provision of simple resources (recorded materials for accurate pronunciation, scripted routines, visual supports), and realistic expectations regarding teacher performance. The model may be supplemented by occasional specialist input for pronunciation modelling or cultural enrichment.

### The Digital Support Model

Increasingly, schools employ digital resources to support KS1 language provision. Subscription services such as Language Angels provide structured programmes with native speaker audio, enabling accurate pronunciation modelling regardless of teacher proficiency. Digital resources offer consistency, quality assurance, and reduced preparation burden for teachers.

However, digital resources should complement rather than replace teacher interaction. Young children require the responsive, relationship-based interaction that only human teachers can provide. Digital materials are most effective when used as a resource within teacher-led activities rather than as the primary mode of instruction.

## Content and Progression at KS1

### Typical Vocabulary Domains

Effective KS1 language provision focuses on high-frequency vocabulary domains that are concrete, relevant to children's experience, and amenable to visual demonstration:

**Greetings and Social Formulae**
Basic greetings (hello, goodbye, good morning), courtesy expressions (please, thank you, sorry), and classroom social routines form the foundation of communicative competence. These items have immediate practical utility and are reinforced through daily use.

**Numbers and Counting**
Number vocabulary (1-20, then decades to 100) supports mathematical development whilst providing practice in sound production and memory. Counting songs and games embed numbers within enjoyable contexts.

**Colours**
Colour vocabulary is concrete, visually demonstrable, and immediately applicable in classroom contexts. Colour words can be integrated across the curriculum—in art, describing objects, sorting activities.

**Classroom Objects**
Names for items in the immediate environment (table, chair, book, pencil, door, window) enable language to be used for practical classroom management and daily routines.

**Body Parts**
Body vocabulary supports PE integration, action songs, and health-related topics. The physical nature of body parts makes meaning transparent and enables kinaesthetic learning approaches.

**Animals**
Animal vocabulary appeals to children's interests and supports topic-based learning. Animals feature prominently in songs, stories, and games, providing engaging contexts for language use.

**Family Members**
Family vocabulary connects to children's personal experience and supports discussion of relationships. Family trees and picture descriptions provide contexts for language production.

**Food and Drink**
Food vocabulary is concrete, culturally relevant, and motivating for children. Snack times, lunch menus, and cultural food exploration provide authentic contexts for language use.

### Grammar and Structure

KS1 provision should not explicitly teach grammar terminology, but should expose children to grammatical patterns through meaningful use:

**Gender Awareness**
In gendered languages such as French or German, children can be sensitized to gender distinctions through article usage (le/la, der/die/das) without abstract explanation. Colour-coded materials can support this awareness visually.

**Word Order Patterns**
Through consistent modelling, children internalise basic word order patterns without explicit rule-learning. French adjective-noun order, for example, can be established through consistent modelling rather than explanation.

**Verb Forms**
Initial exposure focuses on first-person and imperative forms appropriate to children's communicative needs. "I am...", "I have...", and command forms appear naturally in songs, games, and classroom routines.

**Question Forms**
Question intonation patterns and common question words (who, what, where, how many) can be introduced through predictable question-answer routines.

### Progression Expectations

By the end of Year 2, children who have experienced consistent KS1 language provision might reasonably be expected to demonstrate:

- Receptive understanding of familiar vocabulary in spoken contexts
- Ability to respond physically or with single words to simple instructions
- Participation in songs, rhymes, and predictable chants
- Production of memorised phrases appropriate to social formulae
- Recognition of written forms of very familiar words
- Positive attitudes toward language learning and cultural diversity

These expectations should be understood as flexible and indicative rather than prescriptive. The non-statutory nature of KS1 provision means that schools have freedom to set appropriate expectations based on their specific context and provision model.

## Assessment at KS1

### Formative Assessment Approaches

Given the non-statutory status and developmental appropriateness considerations, formal assessment has limited place in KS1 language provision. Assessment should be formative
