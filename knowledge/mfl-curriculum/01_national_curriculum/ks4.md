# Key Stage 4 MFL: Non-Statutory Context, GCSE and EBacc

## Overview of MFL at Key Stage 4

Modern Foreign Languages (MFL) occupies a unique position within the Key Stage 4 curriculum in England. Unlike the core subjects of English, mathematics and science, MFL is not a statutory requirement at KS4, despite being compulsory at Key Stages 2 and 3. This non-statutory status creates significant implications for curriculum planning, pupil uptake, and whole-school accountability measures.

The national curriculum for Key Stage 4 focuses primarily on the core and foundation subjects that are compulsory for all pupils. During KS4, most pupils work towards national qualifications—usually GCSEs or Technical Awards. Whilst the compulsory national curriculum subjects remain limited to the core (English, mathematics and science) and foundation subjects, schools have considerable autonomy in determining which optional subjects to offer beyond these statutory requirements.

This chapter examines the policy landscape for MFL at Key Stage 4, including the non-statutory nature of language study, the structure and content of GCSE specifications, the influence of the English Baccalaureate (EBacc) performance measure, and Ofsted expectations regarding language provision.

## Non-Statutory Status and Curriculum Implications

### The Absence of Statutory Requirement

The national curriculum for Key Stage 4 does not include a statutory requirement for pupils to study a modern foreign language. This represents a significant departure from the position at Key Stage 3, where MFL is a compulsory foundation subject for all pupils aged 11 to 14. The decision to make languages optional at KS4 was taken in the early 2000s, a policy shift that coincided with a dramatic decline in language uptake at GCSE level.

Prior to 2004, languages were compulsory at Key Stage 4. The Labour government's decision to remove this requirement was intended to allow greater pupil choice and to address concerns about pupils being forced to study subjects in which they had little interest or aptitude. However, this policy change led to an immediate and sustained reduction in language entries. Between 2004 and 2011, GCSE entries for French and German fell by approximately 50%, whilst Spanish entries grew modestly but from a much smaller base.

The non-statutory status means that individual schools make autonomous decisions about whether to make languages optional or compulsory within their own KS4 curriculum structures. Some schools, particularly those with traditional academic orientations and selective or partially selective intakes, maintain compulsory language study for all or most pupils. Others, particularly those serving areas of high deprivation with lower prior attainment, have made languages entirely optional, resulting in very low uptake rates.

### Curriculum Time and Option Structures

Schools employ various curriculum models for optional subjects at KS4. The most common structures include:

**Free Choice Models**: Pupils select from a range of option blocks with few restrictions. In these structures, languages compete directly with arts, humanities, technical and vocational subjects for pupil preferences. Without the compelling factor of compulsory status, languages often struggle to attract sufficient numbers to maintain viable class sizes.

**Guided Choice Models**: Schools implement various mechanisms to encourage or steer pupils towards languages. These may include:
- Recommending languages for particular attainment bands
- Restricting certain combinations (for example, preventing pupils from dropping both a humanities subject and a language)
- Using Progress 8 calculations to demonstrate the value of languages for individual pupils
- EBacc pathway structures that pre-select appropriate subject combinations

**Compulsory Models**: Some schools maintain compulsory language study despite the non-statutory status. These are typically grammar schools, faith schools with international orientations, schools in middle-class catchment areas, and institutions with strong established traditions of language teaching.

The curriculum time allocated to MFL at KS4 varies considerably. A typical GCSE language course receives 2-3 hours per week of timetabled lessons, though this may be supplemented by additional sessions, intervention programmes, or independent study expectations. The Ofsted research review noted that insufficient curriculum time is a significant barrier to achieving the depth of linguistic competence required for higher GCSE grades.

## GCSE Modern Foreign Languages

### Overview of GCSE Specifications

GCSE Modern Foreign Languages are offered by the three major English awarding bodies: AQA, Pearson Edexcel, and OCR. The current specifications were introduced for first teaching in September 2016, with first examinations in summer 2018, following significant reforms initiated by the Conservative government.

The reformed GCSEs in modern languages represent a substantial increase in demand compared to their predecessors. Key changes included:

**Removal of Controlled Assessment**: The previous system of modular assessments with substantial speaking controlled assessment components was replaced with linear examinations covering all four skills.

**Increased Vocabulary and Grammar Requirements**: The new specifications introduced defined vocabulary lists (approximately 1,200-1,500 words per language) and explicit grammar requirements that pupils must master.

**Tiered Assessment**: All languages retain a tiered structure, with Foundation Tier (grades 1-5) and Higher Tier (grades 4-9). This creates significant challenges for mixed-attainment classes and departmental resource allocation.

**Translation Components**: Both directions of translation (target language to English and English to target language) became mandatory examination components, testing explicit grammatical knowledge.

**Literature and Film Options**: The specifications include opportunities to study literary texts and films, though these are assessed through writing and speaking rather than separate examination papers.

### Available Languages

The range of languages available at GCSE has expanded considerably, reflecting the diverse linguistic heritage of pupils in English schools. AQA offers the broadest range, including:

- Major European languages: French, German, Spanish, Italian
- Community languages: Bengali, Chinese (Spoken Mandarin), Modern Hebrew, Panjabi, Polish, Urdu
- Classical languages: Classical Greek, Latin

Pearson Edexcel offers French, German and Spanish as its main European languages, alongside a substantial portfolio of community languages including Arabic, Biblical Hebrew, Chinese, Greek, Gujarati, Italian, Japanese, Persian, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish and Urdu.

OCR offers French, German and Spanish, with additional specifications for smaller entry languages.

The availability of community languages is particularly significant for pupils with home language backgrounds. These specifications allow bilingual pupils to achieve formal accreditation for existing linguistic competence, providing an accessible route to EBacc qualification. However, the provision of teaching for these languages varies widely between schools, with many pupils studying independently or through Saturday schools.

### Assessment Structure

GCSE MFL assessments are structured around four components, each testing a distinct skill:

**Listening (25%)**: Pupils respond to recorded spoken material in the target language. Questions require non-verbal responses, selection from options, and written answers in English and the target language. The listening tests cover a range of topics aligned with the specification themes and include both monologues and dialogues at varying speeds.

**Speaking (25%)**: The speaking assessment is conducted by teachers and externally assessed by the awarding body (though prior to the pandemic, it was teacher-assessed and externally moderated). The assessment comprises three tasks:
- A role play requiring pupils to respond to unpredictable elements and demonstrate transactional competence
- A photo card discussion requiring description, opinion-giving and spontaneous responses
- A general conversation covering two themes from the specification, requiring extended responses and grammatical accuracy

**Reading (25%)**: The reading examination includes comprehension questions on authentic and adapted texts, translation from the target language into English, and questions requiring inference and analysis of writer's purpose.

**Writing (25%)**: The writing examination varies significantly between tiers. Foundation Tier includes structured writing tasks with compulsory translation into the target language. Higher Tier requires extended writing in response to open prompts, including the optional literature/film response, alongside translation.

### Specification Themes

All GCSE MFL specifications are organised around common themes that provide contexts for language learning:

**Theme 1: Identity and Culture**
- Me, my family and friends
- Technology in everyday life
- Free-time activities
- Customs and festivals

**Theme 2: Local, National, International and Global Areas of Interest**
- Home, town, neighbourhood and region
- Social issues
- Global issues
- Travel and tourism

**Theme 3: Current and Future Study and Employment**
- My studies
- Life at school/college
- Education post-16
- Jobs, career choices and ambitions

These themes provide a framework for vocabulary and grammar acquisition, but Ofsted's research review emphasised that high-quality language education requires moving beyond topic-based coverage to develop genuine communicative competence and linguistic knowledge.

## The English Baccalaureate (EBacc)

### Origins and Purpose

The English Baccalaureate (EBacc) was introduced by the Coalition government in 2010 as a performance measure for schools, not a qualification for pupils. It recognises pupils who achieve grade 5 or above (formerly grade C or above) in five academic subject areas:

1. English
2. Mathematics
3. Science (including computer science)
4. Humanities (history or geography)
5. Languages (modern or ancient)

The EBacc was explicitly designed to counter what the government perceived as the inappropriate narrowing of the Key Stage 4 curriculum, particularly the shift towards vocational qualifications of variable quality. By measuring the proportion of pupils entered for this academic core, policymakers sought to incentivise schools to maintain broad and balanced curricula.

The inclusion of a language within the EBacc represented a deliberate attempt to reverse the decline in language uptake that followed the 2004 decision to make languages non-statutory at KS4. The government reasoned that schools would prioritise language provision to maximise their EBacc performance figures, thereby increasing language entries without reimposing compulsory status.

### The 90% Target and Current Uptake

In 2017, the Department for Education set ambitious targets for EBacc entry:
- 75% of pupils studying the EBacc subject combination by 2022
- 90% of pupils studying the EBacc subject combination by 2025

These targets were described as government "ambitions" rather than formal requirements, but they have been consistently referenced in policy documents and accountability frameworks.

The 2025 target of 90% has not been achieved and is widely acknowledged to be unattainable under current arrangements. Department for Education data for 2023/24 indicates that only 40.4% of students were entered into the full EBacc including a language. This represents a significant gap from the 90% target and demonstrates the persistent challenges in language uptake.

The EBacc performance measure is structured as follows:
- **EBacc entry**: The proportion of pupils entered for qualifications in all five EBacc pillars
- **EBacc attainment**: The proportion of pupils achieving grade 5 or above in all five pillars (or grade 4 or above for the basic EBacc measure)

Analysis of entry patterns reveals that the language component is the primary barrier to achieving high EBacc entry rates. While the overwhelming majority of pupils are entered for English, mathematics, science and a humanities subject (approximately 85% in each case), only around 46% are entered for a language.

### EBacc and Accountability

The EBacc is incorporated into the school accountability system through several mechanisms:

**Floor Standards**: The EBacc forms part of the floor standards against which school performance is judged. Schools falling below minimum EBacc entry thresholds may face intervention from regional commissioners or Ofsted scrutiny.

**Progress 8**: Whilst the EBacc is distinct from Progress 8, the overlap is substantial. The EBacc subjects align with the "EBacc bucket" within Progress 8 calculations. Schools maximising EBacc entries typically also maximise their Progress 8 scores, creating a dual incentive.

**Ofsted Inspection**: The Education Inspection Framework (EIF) 2019 explicitly references the EBacc in its evaluation of curriculum quality. Inspectors consider whether schools are making appropriate progress towards the 90% ambition and whether curriculum decisions are made in pupils' best interests.

**League Tables**: EBacc entry rates are published prominently in performance tables and are widely reported in media coverage of school results.

### Critiques and Tensions

The EBacc has been subject to extensive critique from educational researchers, subject associations and professional bodies. Key concerns include:

**The Progress 8 Tension**: Researchers have identified a fundamental tension between the EBacc and Progress 8 accountability measures. Because Progress 8 counts a pupil's best eight qualifications, including three from the open group, schools can maximise their scores by allowing pupils to take subjects in which they are likely to achieve high grades, even if this means not entering them for a language. This creates a perverse incentive that works against EBacc policy objectives.

**Socio-Economic Disparities**: Analysis consistently shows that EBacc uptake, and particularly language uptake, varies dramatically by socio-economic status. Pupils in disadvantaged areas, those eligible for free school meals, and those attending schools with low prior attainment intakes are significantly less likely to study languages. This raises equity concerns about the EBacc's impact on curriculum narrowing for already disadvantaged pupils.

**Viability and Class Sizes**: In schools with low language uptake, maintaining viable class sizes becomes challenging. When only small numbers of pupils opt for languages, schools may be unable to timetable language classes economically, leading to withdrawal of provision and further reducing uptake in subsequent years—a vicious cycle of decline.

**Appropriateness for All Pupils**: Critics question whether academic EBacc subjects are appropriate for all pupils, particularly those with significant learning difficulties or those whose strengths lie in practical, vocational or creative areas. The pressure to maximise EBacc entry rates may lead to inappropriate curriculum placements for some pupils.

**Ancient vs Modern Languages**: The EBacc accepts either ancient or modern languages, meaning that schools can achieve EBacc entry through Latin or Classical Greek rather than modern foreign languages. Whilst this supports classical education, it does not address the policy objective of increasing competence in languages relevant to international business and diplomacy.

## Ofsted Expectations for MFL at Key Stage 4

### The Education Inspection Framework (EIF) 2019

Ofsted's Education Inspection Framework, introduced in September 2019, places significant emphasis on curriculum quality and breadth. The framework introduced the concept of the "three Is" of curriculum—Intent, Implementation and Impact—and requires inspectors to evaluate whether schools' curriculum decisions are made in the best interests of pupils.

The EIF explicitly references the EBacc in its inspection handbook. Paragraph 197 states that inspectors will consider:

"How well leaders' curriculum decisions have resulted in a suitably broad and balanced curriculum at key stage 4, including considering how well leaders have followed the government's EBacc ambition."

This creates an expectation that schools should be working towards the 90% EBacc entry target, including the language component, unless they can demonstrate compelling reasons for lower uptake rates.

### The 2021 Research Review

In June 2021, Ofsted published a comprehensive research review on languages education in schools. This document provides the most detailed articulation of Ofsted's expectations for high-quality language provision, including at Key Stage 4.

The research review identified several key features of effective languages education:

**The Three Pillars**: Ofsted emphasised that high-quality language education is built on three pillars—phonics, vocabulary and grammar. These pillars provide the foundation for developing communicative competence and should be explicitly taught and systematically revisited throughout the curriculum.

**Curriculum Sequencing**: Effective language curricula carefully sequence content, ensuring that pupils encounter new linguistic elements in manageable increments and have sufficient opportunities to revisit and consolidate prior learning. The review criticised curricula that simply progress through topic-based units without attending to linguistic progression.

**Explicit Grammar Teaching**: The review supported explicit, deductive grammar instruction, arguing that pupils need conscious understanding of grammatical structures to develop accuracy and complexity in their language use.

**Assessment and Feedback**: Effective assessment practices in languages identify specific gaps in phonological, lexical and grammatical knowledge and provide targeted feedback to address these gaps.

**Curriculum Time**: The review noted that insufficient curriculum time is a significant barrier to achieving depth of linguistic competence. Schools that allocate minimal time to languages at KS3 or compress KS3 into two years create foundations that cannot support success at GCSE.

### Implications for Key Stage 4

The research review has specific implications for MFL provision at Key Stage 4:

**Curriculum Continuity**: Ofsted expects to see clear continuity between KS3 and KS4 programmes of study. The KS3 curriculum should provide the linguistic foundations—vocabulary knowledge, grammatical understanding, phonological competence—that enable pupils to access GCSE content successfully. Inspectors are critical of schools where KS3 curricula are disconnected from GCSE requirements.

**Early Specialisation**: The review expressed concern about the reduction of KS3 to two years in some schools, followed by three-year GCSE programmes. Ofsted argues that this approach limits pupils' exposure to broad curriculum content and may lead to premature specialisation in subjects that should remain optional until Year 10.

**Pupil Progression**: At KS4, inspectors evaluate whether the curriculum enables pupils to make progress towards the ambitious standards of the reformed GCSEs. This includes examining schemes of work, assessment materials and pupil work to verify that teaching is addressing the requirements of the specification at an appropriate level of challenge.

**Options Processes**: Ofsted is interested in how schools manage their options processes and the guidance provided to pupils. Inspectors may question schools where language uptake is low, seeking to understand whether this reflects genuine pupil choice or systemic factors that are limiting access to language study.

### Inspection Practice

In practice, Ofsted inspectors evaluate MFL provision at Key Stage 4 through several mechanisms:

**Deep Dives**: Under the EIF, inspectors conduct "deep dives" into particular subjects. MFL may be selected for deep dive in schools where it forms part of the identified areas of focus, or where inspection planning identifies particular strengths or concerns.

**Curriculum Review**: Inspectors review curriculum documentation, including schemes of work, curriculum maps and resources, to evaluate intent and implementation. For KS4, this includes examination specifications, assessment materials and internal tracking systems.

**Lesson Observation**: Inspectors observe language lessons, focusing on the quality of teaching and its relationship to the planned curriculum. The research review's three pillars framework informs inspection judgements about teaching quality.

**Pupil Voice**: Inspectors speak to pupils about their experiences of language learning, including their perceptions of curriculum organisation, progression, and the support they receive. At KS4, inspectors are particularly interested in pupils' understanding of how their language study connects to examination requirements.

**Progression Data**: Inspectors examine progression data to evaluate whether pupils are making appropriate progress from their starting points. This includes analysing value-added measures, comparing language outcomes to other EBacc subjects, and evaluating the performance of different pupil groups.

## Curriculum Leadership and Strategic Decision-Making

### The Role of Senior Leaders

The non-statutory status of MFL at
The non-statutory status of MFL at KS4 places significant responsibility on senior leaders to make principled decisions about language provision. These decisions have long-term implications for departmental staffing, resource allocation, and the school's ability to meet accountability benchmarks.

Senior leaders must balance multiple competing pressures when designing the KS4 curriculum:

**Accountability Pressures**: The EBacc and Progress 8 measures create strong incentives to maximise language entries. Schools with low language uptake face challenging conversations with Ofsted inspectors and may appear disadvantaged in published performance tables.

**Pupil Choice and Engagement**: The rationale for making languages non-statutory was to respect pupil choice and avoid forcing pupils to study subjects in which they struggle. Senior leaders must consider whether compelling pupils to continue languages against their wishes serves their best interests.

**Resource Constraints**: Maintaining language provision requires specialist teachers, often in multiple languages. In an era of teacher recruitment challenges, particularly for languages, some schools find it difficult to staff language departments adequately.

**Attainment Optimisation**: Schools may calculate that some pupils are more likely to achieve strong grades in alternative subjects than in languages. The Progress 8 system rewards schools for maximising grades across the best eight subjects, creating complex calculations about optimal subject combinations.

### Strategic Approaches

Schools have adopted various strategic approaches to managing these tensions:

**The Compulsory Route**: Some schools maintain languages as compulsory for all or most pupils, regardless of the non-statutory status. This approach aligns with the EBacc ambition and ensures that all pupils continue language study. Schools adopting this approach typically have strong departmental leadership, stable staffing, and a school culture that values academic breadth.

**The Differentiated Route**: Schools make languages compulsory for higher-attaining pupils whilst allowing others to opt out. This approach recognises that the demands of the reformed GCSEs may be inappropriate for some pupils, particularly those with literacy difficulties or Special Educational Needs. However, it raises equity concerns and may reinforce socio-economic disparities in language uptake.

**The Incentivised Route**: Schools maintain optional status but implement strong incentives for language study. These may include:
- Restricting access to certain desirable subjects or pathways unless a language is taken
- Providing extensive guidance during options processes emphasising the value of languages
- Creating "EBacc pathways" that pre-select appropriate subject combinations
- Celebrating and promoting language success prominently

**The Responsive Route**: Schools monitor uptake patterns carefully and adjust their approach in response to emerging trends. This may involve piloting compulsory language study in particular bands, reviewing option block structures to facilitate language choices, or investing in targeted interventions to improve the experience of pupils who struggle with languages.

## Implications for Curriculum Design

### Building KS3 Foundations

The non-statutory status of KS4 languages makes the quality of KS3 provision particularly critical. Schools that wish to maintain strong language uptake must ensure that the KS3 curriculum builds secure foundations and fosters pupil confidence and enthusiasm.

Ofsted's research review identified several features of effective KS3 language provision:

**Substantial Curriculum Time**: Schools achieving strong language outcomes typically allocate at least 2 hours per week to languages throughout KS3. Compressed KS3 models that reduce language time make it difficult to cover the necessary content adequately.

**Clear Linguistic Progression**: Effective curricula move beyond topic-based organisation to focus on the systematic development of phonological, lexical and grammatical knowledge. Pupils should understand how their learning is building towards GCSE requirements.

**Engagement and Motivation**: Given that pupils will have the option to drop languages at the end of Year 9, it is essential that the KS3 experience is engaging and success-oriented. Schools with high uptake rates typically invest in cultural enrichment, international partnerships, and celebratory activities that make language learning enjoyable.

**Transparent Assessment**: Pupils and parents should understand the progress being made and how this relates to likely GCSE performance. Schools that hide language assessment data or fail to communicate progress concerns until options time often experience sharp declines in uptake.

### Managing Options Processes

The options process represents a critical moment for language uptake. Schools that manage this process effectively typically:

**Start Early**: Discussions about language options begin in Year 8 or earlier, not just before the options deadline. This allows time to address concerns, provide additional support, and change perceptions.

**Provide Individual Guidance**: Rather than relying solely on assemblies and option booklets, effective schools provide individual guidance conversations that address each pupil's specific circumstances and aspirations.

**Use Data Transparently**: Schools should show pupils how their prior attainment and current performance in languages predict likely GCSE outcomes. This enables informed decision-making.

**Address Barriers Proactively**: Schools should identify pupils who are considering dropping languages and understand their reasons. Sometimes simple interventions—extra support, confidence-building, clarification about requirements—can change decisions.

**Engage Parents**: Parental attitudes significantly influence pupil choices. Schools should ensure parents understand the value of language study, the requirements of the EBacc, and the school's rationale for its recommendations.

## Conclusion

The non-statutory status of Modern Foreign Languages at Key Stage 4 creates a complex policy environment that shapes curriculum decisions in every English secondary school. The tension between the government's EBacc ambition—which presumes language study for 90% of pupils—and the reality of optional status creates ongoing challenges for senior leaders.

Understanding this landscape is essential for MFL subject leaders seeking to protect and enhance language provision. Key insights include:

1. **The policy context matters**: Decisions about language provision cannot be made in isolation from accountability pressures. Schools need strategies that balance principled educational values with pragmatic responses to Progress 8, EBacc and Ofsted expectations.

2. **KS3 is the foundation**: With languages optional at KS4, the quality of KS3 provision becomes critical. Schools must invest in strong KS3 programmes that build confidence, competence and enthusiasm.

3. **The options process is pivotal**: How schools manage the transition from KS3 to KS4 significantly shapes uptake patterns. Effective processes are early, transparent, individualised and parent-inclusive.

4. **Accountability creates both pressure and opportunity**: While the EBacc and EIF create pressure to maintain language provision, they also provide leverage for subject leaders arguing for resources, staffing and curriculum time.

5. **The reformed GCSE raises the stakes**: The increased demands of the 2016 specifications mean that pupils need stronger foundations and more teaching time to succeed. Schools cannot simply continue previous approaches in a more demanding environment.

For schools committed to providing a broad and balanced curriculum, MFL remains an essential component of the Key Stage 4 offer. Navigating the non-statutory context successfully requires clear strategic thinking, robust KS3 provision, and careful management of the options process. The goal is not simply to maximise entries, but to ensure that every pupil who studies a language at KS4 does so with appropriate preparation, genuine choice, and a realistic prospect of success.
