# Key Stage 2 Languages: Statutory Requirements

## Introduction

The study of a modern foreign language at Key Stage 2 became a statutory requirement for all maintained primary schools in England in September 2014, as part of the new National Curriculum. This represented a significant policy shift, reintroducing compulsory language learning at primary level for the first time since the 1970s. The rationale behind this change was recognition that early exposure to language learning enhances linguistic competence, intercultural understanding, and cognitive development, while also preparing pupils for the more rigorous demands of language study at Key Stage 3 and beyond.

The Key Stage 2 languages programme of study sets out the statutory requirements that all pupils must be taught during Years 3, 4, 5, and 6. Unlike at Key Stages 1 and 2 for other subjects, schools have considerable autonomy in deciding which language to teach, though the programme of study is designed to be applicable to any modern or ancient spoken language. This flexibility allows schools to build on staff expertise, community languages, or feeder secondary school arrangements.

This document provides a comprehensive examination of the statutory requirements for Key Stage 2 languages, drawing upon the official National Curriculum documentation, guidance from the Association for Language Learning, Ofsted research, and practical insights from primary language teaching. It addresses the structure of the programme of study, the requirements for the four language skills, approaches to implementation, and the transition to Key Stage 3.

## The Statutory Framework

### Policy Context

The inclusion of languages in the statutory National Curriculum at Key Stage 2 emerged from growing concern about the decline in language learning in England. Despite the expansion of language teaching in primary schools during the 2000s through various initiatives, provision had remained patchy and non-statutory. The 2014 National Curriculum sought to ensure universal entitlement to language learning from age 7, establishing the foundations for improved language competence nationally.

The policy rationale draws on research indicating:

- **Younger learners' aptitude**: Younger children are generally more receptive to language learning, with greater flexibility in pronunciation and lower anxiety about speaking
- **Cognitive benefits**: Language learning enhances cognitive development, including problem-solving, critical thinking, and memory
- **Foundation for future learning**: Early exposure provides a stronger foundation for the more intensive study required at Key Stage 3
- **Intercultural awareness**: Language learning fosters understanding of other cultures and perspectives, contributing to global citizenship

### Programme of Study Structure

The Key Stage 2 languages programme of study is structured around twelve aims organised into four attainment targets:

1. **Listening** (interpretation of spoken language)
2. **Speaking** (spoken production and interaction)
3. **Reading** (interpretation of written language)
4. **Writing** (written production)

Unlike some other National Curriculum subjects, the languages programme of study does not specify content (vocabulary or grammar points) that must be taught. Instead, it sets out broad competencies that pupils should develop, giving schools flexibility in how they achieve these outcomes. This approach recognises that different languages have different grammatical structures and that schools may teach different languages.

## The Four Attainment Targets

### Listening

Pupils should be taught to:

- Listen attentively to spoken language and show understanding by joining in and responding
- Explore the patterns and sounds of language through songs and rhymes and link the spelling, sound and meaning of words

The listening requirements emphasise active engagement with spoken language. "Joining in and responding" indicates that listening is not a passive activity but involves interaction and participation. The reference to songs and rhymes recognises that these are powerful tools for language learning, helping pupils to internalise pronunciation, rhythm, and intonation patterns.

The requirement to "link the spelling, sound and meaning of words" addresses the phoneme-grapheme correspondence in the target language, which may differ significantly from English. This is particularly important for languages with different writing systems or sound-spelling relationships.

### Speaking

Pupils should be taught to:

- Engage in conversations; ask and answer questions; express opinions and respond to those of others; seek clarification and help
- Speak in sentences, using familiar vocabulary, phrases and basic language structures
- Develop accurate pronunciation and intonation so that others understand when they are reading aloud or using familiar words and phrases
- Present ideas and information orally to a range of audiences

The speaking requirements establish a progression from formulaic language use towards more spontaneous communication. Early stages focus on speaking "in sentences" using "familiar vocabulary, phrases and basic language structures"—formulaic language that builds confidence. The requirement to "engage in conversations" with questions, answers, opinions, and clarification moves towards more authentic interaction.

The emphasis on "accurate pronunciation and intonation" recognises that the primary years offer a window of opportunity for developing pronunciation that may close later. The requirement to present "to a range of audiences" encourages authentic communication beyond the classroom.

### Reading

Pupils should be taught to:

- Read carefully and show understanding of words, phrases and simple writing
- Appreciate stories, songs, poems and rhymes in the language
- Broaden their vocabulary and develop their ability to understand new words that are introduced into familiar written material, including through using a dictionary

The reading requirements focus initially on comprehension of familiar language, with progression towards understanding new vocabulary in context. The reference to "stories, songs, poems and rhymes" recognises the importance of accessible, engaging texts that provide cultural insights alongside language learning.

The requirement to use a dictionary introduces a tool for independent learning, though the limitations of dictionary use (selecting appropriate meanings, understanding grammatical information) need to be taught explicitly.

### Writing

Pupils should be taught to:

- Write phrases from memory, and adapt these to create new sentences, to express ideas clearly
- Describe people, places, things and actions orally and in writing

The writing requirements are modest, reflecting both the limited time typically available for language teaching in primary schools and the cognitive demands of writing in a new language. The focus is on writing "phrases from memory" and adapting them, rather than producing entirely original writing. This approach scaffolds writing by providing models that pupils can manipulate.

The requirement to describe "people, places, things and actions" provides a framework for content, ensuring that pupils develop the language for everyday communication about their immediate world.

## Cross-Cutting Themes

### Grammar

While the programme of study does not specify grammatical content, it requires that pupils be taught to:

- Understand basic grammar appropriate to the language being studied, including (where relevant): feminine, masculine and neuter forms and the conjugation of high-frequency verbs; key features and patterns of the language; how to apply these, for instance, to build sentences; and how these differ from or are similar to English

This requirement acknowledges that different languages have different grammatical features. For French, this would include gender and verb conjugations; for German, case endings; for Spanish, verb forms and gender; for Mandarin, tones and character formation. Schools must ensure that grammar is taught explicitly, but with flexibility appropriate to the language.

The comparison with English is important, helping pupils to understand language as a system and to develop metalinguistic awareness.

### Intercultural Understanding

The programme of study requires that teaching should:

- Enable pupils to understand and communicate ideas, facts and feelings in speech and writing, focused on familiar and routine matters, using their knowledge of phonology, grammatical structures and vocabulary

While not explicitly labelled as "intercultural understanding" in the programme of study document, the requirement to develop knowledge of "phonology, grammatical structures and vocabulary" implies engagement with the cultural context of the language. Effective language teaching integrates cultural learning, helping pupils understand the societies where the language is spoken.

## Implementation: Choosing a Language

### School Autonomy

Schools have considerable autonomy in deciding which language to teach. The statutory programme of study states that pupils should be taught a "modern or ancient spoken language," giving schools flexibility to choose from a wide range of possibilities including:

- **Modern European languages**: French, German, Spanish, Italian, etc.
- **Community languages**: Urdu, Polish, Bengali, Punjabi, etc.
- **Heritage languages**: Languages with particular relevance to the local community
- **Ancient languages**: Latin, Classical Greek (though these are less commonly taught at KS2)

### Factors Influencing Choice

Schools consider various factors when choosing a language:

**Staff expertise**: The most common approach is to teach a language in which staff have competence, typically French, Spanish, or German.

**Secondary school links**: Many primary schools choose the language taught by their feeder secondary schools to ensure progression.

**Community context**: Schools may choose languages relevant to their local community, valuing the linguistic capital that pupils bring and fostering home-school connections.

**Resources**: Availability of teaching materials, training, and support may influence choice.

**Pupil and parent preference**: Some schools consult pupils and parents about language choice.

### Mixed Economy Approaches

Some schools adopt mixed approaches:

- **Language awareness**: Teaching about different languages and language diversity rather than focusing on one language
- **Taster courses**: Introducing pupils to multiple languages before they specialise
- **Multi-language programmes**: Teaching different languages in different year groups

While these approaches have value in developing language awareness, they may provide less depth in any one language.

## Pedagogical Approaches

### The Primary Context

Language teaching at Key Stage 2 occurs within specific contextual constraints:

**Time allocation**: Most schools allocate 30-60 minutes per week to language teaching, though this varies considerably.

**Non-specialist teaching**: Many primary teachers are non-specialists in languages, though this is changing with the growth of primary language specialists.

**Integration with other subjects**: Languages are often taught through cross-curricular approaches, integrating language learning with topics from other subjects.

**Focus on oracy**: Given time constraints and the age of learners, many primary programmes emphasise listening and speaking over reading and writing.

### Effective Pedagogy

Research and practice suggest several principles for effective primary language teaching:

**High-quality input**: Pupils need extensive exposure to the spoken language, from teachers, recordings, and multimedia resources.

**Interaction**: Opportunities for meaningful communication, even at simple levels, are essential.

**Multisensory approaches**: Combining auditory, visual, and kinaesthetic approaches supports memory and engagement.

**Repetition and recycling**: Vocabulary and structures need to be encountered multiple times in different contexts.

**Cultural embedding**: Language learning should include cultural learning, helping pupils understand the contexts in which the language is used.

**Fun and enjoyment**: Primary language learning should be engaging and enjoyable, building positive attitudes towards language learning.

### The Role of the Specialist Teacher

While many primary schools use class teachers to deliver languages, others employ specialist language teachers. Each model has advantages:

**Class teacher model**:
- Languages can be integrated throughout the curriculum
- Class teachers know their pupils well
- Builds capacity across the school
- Challenges: May lack language proficiency; requires significant training

**Specialist teacher model**:
- High-quality language modelling
- Specialist pedagogical knowledge
- Can teach across multiple classes
- Challenges: May not know pupils as well; integration with class work may be weaker

Many schools use hybrid models, with specialist teachers supporting class teachers or teaching specific year groups.

## Assessment and Progression

### Assessing without Levels

Following the removal of National Curriculum levels, schools have developed their own approaches to assessing progress in languages. Common approaches include:

- **Competency frameworks**: Assessing against the four attainment targets (listening, speaking, reading, writing)
- **Progress descriptors**: Describing what pupils can do at different stages
- **Portfolio approaches**: Collecting evidence of achievement over time
- **Can-do statements**: Using "I can..." statements to describe capabilities

### Monitoring Progress

Effective assessment focuses on what pupils can do with the language:

- Can they understand familiar spoken language?
- Can they respond appropriately in familiar situations?
- Can they read and understand simple texts?
- Can they write phrases from memory and adapt them?

Assessment should be low-stakes and focused on supporting learning rather than making high-stakes judgments.

### Identifying Gaps

Teachers monitor for:

- Pronunciation difficulties
- Limited vocabulary retention
- Difficulties with grammatical concepts
- Lack of confidence in speaking
- Gaps in cultural knowledge

Early identification allows for targeted support.

## Transition to Key Stage 3

### The Challenge of Transition

The transition from Key Stage 2 to Key Stage 3 is a critical point for language learning. Research indicates that progress often stalls at this point, with pupils experiencing:

- **Repetition of content**: KS3 teachers may not trust KS2 assessment and repeat beginner content
- **Loss of momentum**: The intensity of KS3 language study may not match the enthusiasm developed at primary
- **Different approaches**: Secondary teaching may differ significantly from primary approaches
- **Motivation issues**: Some pupils feel they are not making progress or cannot see the relevance

### Ensuring Effective Transition

Effective practice for transition includes:

**Information sharing**: Primary schools sharing detailed information about what pupils have learned and can do

**Assessment on entry**: Secondary schools assessing pupils' capabilities on entry to ensure appropriate placement

**Differentiated provision**: Ensuring that pupils with strong KS2 foundations are challenged, while those with weaker foundations are supported

**Curriculum continuity**: KS3 schemes of work building on KS2 content rather than starting from scratch

**Positive messaging**: Emphasising the value of prior learning and the opportunities for development at KS3

### The Role of the Secondary Teacher

Secondary language teachers play a crucial role in ensuring that primary language learning is valued and built upon. This requires:

- Understanding of what is taught at KS2
- Assessment approaches that identify prior learning
- Flexibility in curriculum planning to accommodate different starting points
- Positive attitudes towards primary language provision

## Common Challenges

### Time Constraints

The most commonly cited challenge is lack of time. With competing pressures on the primary curriculum, languages may receive limited time allocation. Strategies to address this include:

- Integrating languages into other subjects (cross-curricular approaches)
- Using incidental opportunities (classroom routines, greetings, etc.)
- Maximising the impact of allocated time through effective pedagogy

### Teacher Confidence and Competence

Many primary teachers lack confidence in their own language skills. Support strategies include:

- High-quality training and professional development
- Resources with good audio support
- Collaboration with specialist teachers
- Networking with other schools

### Sustainability

Maintaining language provision over time can be challenging, particularly when key staff leave. Building sustainable provision requires:

- Whole-school commitment to languages
- Distributed expertise across multiple staff
- Clear policies and documentation
- Links with secondary schools and other partners

### Inclusion

Ensuring that all pupils, including those with special educational needs or English as an additional language, can access language learning requires:

- Differentiated activities
- Multi-sensory approaches
- Recognition of the linguistic resources that EAL pupils bring
- Support for pupils with speech and language difficulties

## Resources and Support

### National Resources

Several organisations support primary language teaching:

- **The Association for Language Learning (ALL)**: Professional association providing resources, training, and networking
- **The British Council**: International partnerships and cultural resources
- **The Goethe-Institut, Institut Français, Instituto Cervantes**: Cultural institutes providing resources for specific languages

### Online Resources

Numerous online resources support primary language teaching:

- **Language learning apps**: Duolingo, Memrise, etc.
- **Video resources**: BBC Bitesize, YouTube channels
- **Interactive materials**: Websites with games, songs, and activities
- **Virtual exchanges**: Opportunities for communication with pupils in other countries

### Training and Professional Development

Effective primary language teaching requires ongoing professional development:

- Subject knowledge enhancement for non-specialists
- Pedagogical training for language teaching
- Opportunities for immersion and study visits
- Networking and sharing practice with other teachers

## Conclusion

The statutory requirement for language learning at Key Stage 2 represents a significant opportunity to improve language education in England. By establishing foundations in the primary years, pupils are better prepared for the demands of Key Stage 3 and beyond, while also gaining cognitive benefits and intercultural understanding.

Effective implementation requires:

- Adequate time allocation
- High-quality teaching, whether by specialists or confident class teachers
- Appropriate resources and support
- Attention to transition and progression
- Whole-school commitment

While challenges remain, particularly around time and teacher expertise, the statutory framework provides a foundation for universal entitlement to language learning. As schools develop their practice and build capacity, the quality and consistency of primary language provision continue to improve, realising the vision of the 2014 National Curriculum.

The flexibility of the programme of study—allowing schools to choose which language to teach and how to achieve the attainment targets—enables schools to develop provision that suits their context while ensuring that all pupils develop the foundational language skills that will serve them throughout their education and beyond.
