# Key Stage 3 Languages: Statutory Requirements

## Introduction

The study of a modern foreign language is a statutory requirement at Key Stage 3 (KS3) for all pupils in maintained schools in England. This requirement, established in the 2014 National Curriculum, represents a commitment to ensuring that all pupils continue their language learning journey from primary education into secondary school. The KS3 languages programme of study builds upon the foundations laid at Key Stage 2 (or begins language learning for those who did not study a language at primary school) and prepares pupils for the more rigorous demands of GCSE language study.

The Key Stage 3 languages programme of study is designed to provide a solid foundation in the target language, developing pupils' ability to communicate effectively in speech and writing, understand spoken and written language, and appreciate the culture of countries where the language is spoken. The curriculum emphasises practical communication skills while also introducing pupils to the grammatical structures and linguistic features of the language.

This document provides a comprehensive account of the statutory requirements for Key Stage 3 languages, drawing upon the official National Curriculum documentation, guidance from the Department for Education, and insights from language education research and practice.

## The Statutory Framework

### Legal Requirements

The National Curriculum for Languages at Key Stage 3 requires that:

- All pupils in maintained schools must study a modern foreign language during Years 7, 8, and 9
- The language studied may be one that pupils have learned at primary school or a new language
- Teaching should build on the foundations of language learning laid at Key Stage 2, whether pupils continue with the same language or take up a new one

### Programme of Study Structure

The Key Stage 3 languages programme of study is organised around three attainment targets:

1. **Listening**: Understanding and responding to spoken language
2. **Speaking**: Communicating effectively in speech
3. **Reading**: Understanding and responding to written language
4. **Writing**: Communicating effectively in writing

Unlike Key Stage 2, where schools may choose which language to teach, at Key Stage 3 schools typically offer one or more languages, with pupils usually continuing with the language they studied at primary school or beginning a new language in Year 7.

### Aims of the Programme of Study

The Key Stage 3 languages programme of study aims to ensure that all pupils:

- Understand and respond to spoken and written language from a variety of authentic sources
- Speak with increasing confidence, fluency and spontaneity, finding ways of communicating what they want to say, including through discussion and asking questions, and continually improving the accuracy of their pronunciation and intonation
- Can write at varying length, for different purposes and audiences, using the variety of grammatical structures that they have learnt
- Discover and develop an appreciation of a range of writing in the language studied

## The Four Attainment Targets

### Listening

Pupils should be taught to:

- **Listen to a variety of forms of spoken language** to obtain information and respond appropriately
- **Transcribe words and short sentences** that they hear with increasing accuracy

The listening requirements at Key Stage 3 demand that pupils engage with authentic spoken language, including language spoken at near-native speed. Pupils learn to extract meaning from spoken sources even when they do not understand every word, developing strategies for coping with unknown vocabulary and unfamiliar accents.

Listening activities at KS3 include:
- Understanding the main points and specific details of spoken passages
- Identifying gist, attitude, and opinion in spoken language
- Following extended passages that include unfamiliar language
- Responding appropriately to spoken instructions and information

### Speaking

Pupils should be taught to:

- **Initiate and develop conversations**, coping with unfamiliar language and unexpected responses, making use of important social conventions such as formal modes of address
- **Express and develop ideas clearly and with increasing accuracy**, both orally and in writing
- **Speak coherently and confidently**, with increasingly accurate pronunciation and intonation

Speaking at Key Stage 3 moves beyond the formulaic language of primary years towards more spontaneous communication. Pupils learn to:
- Participate in conversations on a range of topics
- Express opinions and justify them
- Ask questions to clarify meaning or obtain information
- Adapt their language to different social situations
- Use a range of discourse markers and conversational strategies

### Reading

Pupils should be taught to:

- **Read and show comprehension of original and adapted materials** from a range of different sources, understanding the purpose, important ideas and details, and provide an accurate English translation of short, suitable material
- **Read literary texts** in the language (such as stories, songs, poems and letters) to stimulate ideas, develop creative expression and expand understanding of the language and culture

Reading at Key Stage 3 involves engagement with a range of text types:
- Authentic texts (signs, notices, advertisements, brochures)
- Adapted texts written for learners
- Literary texts (extracts from stories, poems, songs)
- Extended passages that develop reading stamina

Pupils develop strategies for understanding texts, including:
- Identifying cognates and near-cognates
- Using context to deduce meaning
- Recognising text type conventions
- Extracting specific information (scanning)
- Understanding gist (skimming)

### Writing

Pupils should be taught to:

- **Write prose using an increasingly wide range of grammar and vocabulary**, write creatively to express their own ideas and opinions, and translate short written text accurately into the foreign language

Writing at Key Stage 3 develops from simple sentences to connected prose:
- Producing short texts on a range of familiar topics
- Writing for different purposes (informing, describing, narrating, expressing opinions)
- Using an increasing range of grammatical structures
- Adapting language for different audiences
- Translating from English into the target language

## Grammar and Vocabulary

### Grammatical Content

The Key Stage 3 programme of study requires teaching of grammatical structures and vocabulary appropriate to the language being studied. While the specific grammar points vary by language, the programme of study identifies areas that should be covered:

**Key grammatical concepts include**:

- **Nouns and articles**: Gender (in languages such as French, Spanish, German), number (singular and plural), articles (definite, indefinite, partitive)

- **Adjectives**: Agreement with nouns, position (before or after nouns), comparative and superlative forms

- **Verbs**: Subject pronouns, present tense (regular and common irregular verbs), past tenses (perfect and/or imperfect as appropriate), future tense, imperative mood, modal verbs

- **Sentence structure**: Word order, negation, questions (interrogative words, inversion, intonation), complex sentences with subordination

- **Other structures**: Adverbs, prepositions, pronouns (direct and indirect object, relative, demonstrative), possessives, quantifiers

### Vocabulary Development

Pupils should develop vocabulary across a range of topic areas, including:

- Self, family and friends
- Home and local area
- School and education
- Free time and leisure activities
- Food and drink
- Shopping and money
- Travel and transport
- Health and illness
- The environment
- Current affairs and social issues (at an appropriate level)

Vocabulary learning at Key Stage 3 emphasises:
- Learning words in context
- Developing strategies for learning and remembering vocabulary
- Recognising cognates and patterns
- Understanding multiple meanings and uses
- Expanding vocabulary through reading and listening

## Cultural Understanding

### Intercultural Awareness

While not specified as a separate attainment target, cultural understanding is integral to language learning at Key Stage 3. Pupils should:

- **Learn about the countries where the language is spoken**: Geography, history, daily life, customs and traditions
- **Understand cultural conventions**: Appropriate forms of address, social customs, attitudes and values
- **Compare cultures**: Recognising similarities and differences between their own culture and the target language culture
- **Develop positive attitudes**: Towards language learning and speakers of other languages

### Authentic Materials

The programme of study emphasises the use of authentic materials—real texts and recordings produced for native speakers. These might include:
- Websites and social media from target language countries
- Songs, films, and television programmes
- Newspapers, magazines, and brochures
- Literary texts adapted for learners

Authentic materials:
- Expose pupils to language as it is really used
- Develop strategies for coping with unfamiliar language
- Increase motivation through engagement with "real" language
- Provide cultural insights

## Transition and Continuity

### From Key Stage 2

Key Stage 3 teaching should build on the foundations of language learning laid at Key Stage 2. This presents challenges because:

- Not all pupils have studied a language at primary school
- Those who have may have learned different languages
- Experience of language learning at primary school varies widely in quality and quantity

Effective practice for transition includes:
- **Assessment on entry**: Finding out what pupils know and can do
- **Differentiated provision**: Providing support for beginners and challenge for those with prior learning
- **Revisiting and consolidating**: Ensuring all pupils have secure foundations before moving forward
- **Building confidence**: Valuing what pupils have learned while addressing gaps

### To Key Stage 4

Key Stage 3 should prepare pupils for the demands of GCSE language study:

- **GCSE requirements**: Understanding spoken and written language, speaking and writing with increasing spontaneity and accuracy
- **Themes**: The GCSE themes (Identity and culture; Local, national, international and global areas of interest; Current and future study and employment) should be introduced at KS3
- **Skills**: The skills required for GCSE (translation, understanding authentic texts, spontaneous speaking) should be developed
- **Motivation**: Maintaining enthusiasm for language learning so that pupils choose to continue to GCSE

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Communicative Language Teaching

The Key Stage 3 programme of study supports a communicative approach:

- **Focus on communication**: The goal is to communicate meaning, not just to produce grammatically correct sentences
- **Authentic tasks**: Activities reflect real-world uses of language
- **Interaction**: Pair and group work promotes communication
- **Fluency and accuracy**: Both are important, with increasing emphasis on fluency as pupils progress

### Grammar-Integrated Teaching

Grammar is taught explicitly but integrated into communicative activities:

- **Contextualised grammar**: Grammar is taught in context, not as isolated rules
- **Inductive approaches**: Pupils discover patterns through exposure to language
- **Practice**: Controlled practice leads to freer production
- **Recycling**: Grammar is revisited regularly in different contexts

### Developing Independence

Key Stage 3 should develop pupils as independent language learners:

- **Learning strategies**: Teaching strategies for vocabulary learning, dealing with unknown language, and self-correction
- **Reference materials**: Using dictionaries, verb tables, and grammar references effectively
- **Self-assessment**: Encouraging pupils to reflect on their own learning
- **Homework and independent study**: Developing habits of independent practice

## Assessment at Key Stage 3

### Formative Assessment

Ongoing formative assessment is essential:

- **Monitoring progress**: Regular checking of understanding and skills
- **Feedback**: Providing specific feedback on how to improve
- **Self and peer assessment**: Developing pupils' ability to assess their own and others' work
- **Questioning**: Using questions to probe understanding and develop thinking

### Summative Assessment

Schools use various approaches to summative assessment:

- **End-of-unit tests**: Assessing vocabulary, grammar, and skills
- **Common assessments**: Shared assessments across classes or year groups
- **Assessment of the four skills**: Listening, speaking, reading, and writing
- **Progress tracking**: Monitoring progress against expectations

### Standards and Expectations

While there are no national standards for Key Stage 3 languages, schools typically expect that by the end of Year 9, pupils should:

- Understand the main points and specific details of spoken and written texts on familiar topics
- Participate in conversations on familiar topics, expressing opinions and responding to others
- Write coherent texts on familiar topics, using a range of grammatical structures
- Have a sufficient vocabulary for everyday communication
- Have a basic understanding of grammar appropriate to the language

## Challenges and Considerations

### Managing Mixed-Experience Groups

The varying experience pupils bring from primary school creates challenges:

- **Differentiation**: Providing appropriate challenge and support for all
- **Grouping**: Decisions about setting, mixed-ability teaching, or other grouping arrangements
- **Materials**: Using materials that can be accessed by pupils with different starting points

### Maintaining Motivation

Some pupils lose enthusiasm for language learning at Key Stage 3:

- **Relevance**: Making language learning relevant to pupils' interests and future goals
- **Success**: Ensuring all pupils experience success
- **Variety**: Using a range of activities and approaches
- **Culture**: Engaging pupils with the culture of target language countries

### Time Allocation

Time for languages varies between schools:

- **Recommended time**: 2-3 hours per week is typical
- **Timetabling**: The position of languages on the timetable affects learning
- **Continuity**: Regular, frequent lessons are more effective than sporadic longer sessions

### Teacher Expertise

The quality of language teaching depends on teacher expertise:

- **Language proficiency**: Teachers need strong language skills, particularly for speaking
- **Pedagogical knowledge**: Understanding how to teach languages effectively
- **Subject knowledge**: Understanding the grammar and culture of the target language
- **Professional development**: Ongoing development to maintain and enhance skills

## Conclusion

The Key Stage 3 languages programme of study provides a framework for ensuring that all pupils continue their language learning journey into secondary education. By the end of Year 9, pupils should have developed the foundational skills and knowledge that enable them to continue to GCSE and beyond, or to use the language in practical situations even if they do not pursue formal qualifications.

Effective Key Stage 3 language teaching balances the development of practical communication skills with grammatical knowledge and cultural understanding. It builds on prior learning while recognising that not all pupils have the same starting point. It maintains motivation by making language learning relevant and enjoyable, while also preparing pupils for the demands of GCSE study.

The statutory requirement for language study at Key Stage 3 ensures that all pupils have the opportunity to develop this important skill, contributing to their educational, personal, and future professional development. In an increasingly interconnected world, the ability to communicate in another language is a valuable asset, and the Key Stage 3 programme of study provides the foundation for this capability.
