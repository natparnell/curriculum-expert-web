# MFL National Curriculum: Statutory Overview

## Purpose and Context

### Purpose of Study

Learning a foreign language is described in the National Curriculum as "a liberation from insularity" that provides "an opening to other cultures." The statutory framework positions high-quality languages education as fostering pupils' curiosity and deepening their understanding of the world. Teaching should enable pupils to express their ideas and thoughts in another language, understand and respond to its speakers in speech and writing, communicate for practical purposes, learn new ways of thinking, and read great literature in the original language. Language teaching should provide the foundation for learning further languages, equipping pupils to study and work in other countries.

### Statutory Status Across Key Stages

Modern Foreign Languages occupy a unique position in the National Curriculum — compulsory at Key Stage 2 (ages 7–11) and Key Stage 3 (ages 11–14), but not statutory at Key Stage 4 (14–16) or Key Stage 5 (16–18). This creates significant curriculum planning challenges, particularly around transition and progression.

| Key Stage | Ages | Status | Subject Title |
|-----------|------|--------|---------------|
| EYFS | 3–5 | Non-statutory | n/a (Communication and Language ELG) |
| KS1 | 5–7 | Non-statutory | n/a |
| KS2 | 7–11 | **Statutory** (since 2014) | Foreign Language |
| KS3 | 11–14 | **Statutory** | Modern Foreign Language |
| KS4 | 14–16 | Non-statutory (but EBacc) | Modern Foreign Language |
| KS5 | 16–18 | Non-statutory | Modern Foreign Language |

At Key Stage 2, the subject is titled "Foreign Language" (not "Modern Foreign Language") because schools may teach either a modern or ancient language. At Key Stage 3, only modern foreign languages are statutory.

## National Curriculum Aims

The National Curriculum for languages aims to ensure that all pupils:

- Understand and respond to spoken and written language from a variety of authentic sources
- Speak with increasing confidence, fluency and spontaneity, finding ways of communicating what they want to say, including through discussion and asking questions, and continually improving the accuracy of their pronunciation and intonation
- Can write at varying length, for different purposes and audiences, using the variety of grammatical structures that they have learnt
- Discover and develop an appreciation of a range of writing in the language studied

### Attainment Target

The single attainment target applies across both key stages: "By the end of each key stage, pupils are expected to know, apply and understand the matters, skills and processes specified in the relevant programme of study."

Schools are not required by law to teach the example content shown in square brackets in the programmes of study.

## Key Stage 2: Programme of Study

### Overview

KS2 languages became statutory in September 2014. Teaching may address any modern or ancient foreign language and should focus on enabling pupils to make substantial progress in one language. The curriculum should provide an appropriate balance of spoken and written language and lay the foundations for further foreign language teaching at Key Stage 3.

The focus for modern languages is on practical communication. If an ancient language is chosen, the focus shifts to providing a linguistic foundation for reading comprehension and an appreciation of classical civilisation.

### Statutory Content — Pupils Should Be Taught To:

**Listening and Speaking:**
- Listen attentively to spoken language and show understanding by joining in and responding
- Explore the patterns and sounds of language through songs and rhymes and link the spelling, sound and meaning of words
- Engage in conversations; ask and answer questions; express opinions and respond to those of others; seek clarification and help
- Speak in sentences, using familiar vocabulary, phrases and basic language structures
- Develop accurate pronunciation and intonation so that others understand when they are reading aloud or using familiar words and phrases
- Present ideas and information orally to a range of audiences

**Reading:**
- Read carefully and show understanding of words, phrases and simple writing
- Appreciate stories, songs, poems and rhymes in the language
- Broaden their vocabulary and develop their ability to understand new words that are introduced into familiar written material, including through using a dictionary

**Writing:**
- Write phrases from memory, and adapt these to create new sentences, to express ideas clearly
- Describe people, places, things and actions orally and in writing

**Grammar:**
- Understand basic grammar appropriate to the language being studied, including (where relevant): feminine, masculine and neuter forms and the conjugation of high-frequency verbs; key features and patterns of the language; how to apply these, for instance, to build sentences; and how these differ from or are similar to English

### Common Misconceptions and Challenges at KS2

- **"Any exposure is good exposure"** — Ofsted has found that variable quality of provision at KS2 undermines progression. Brief, unfocused sessions without structured curriculum planning do not build the foundation KS3 requires.
- **"Cultural activities replace language learning"** — While intercultural understanding is valuable, it should not displace systematic teaching of phonics, vocabulary and grammar.
- **Staff expertise** — Many primary teachers lack confidence and subject knowledge in MFL. The Association for Language Learning (ALL) and the National Centre for Excellence in Language Pedagogy (NCELP) provide CPD resources.
- **Time allocation** — Schools vary enormously in time given to languages, from 30 minutes weekly to dedicated daily sessions. Research suggests a minimum of 60 minutes per week for meaningful progress.
- **Transition to KS3** — Without clear communication between primary and secondary schools, pupils often experience the "restart culture" where KS3 begins from scratch regardless of KS2 learning.

## Key Stage 3: Programme of Study

### Overview

KS3 MFL should build on the foundations laid at Key Stage 2, whether pupils continue with the same language or take up a new one. Teaching should focus on developing the breadth and depth of pupils' competence in listening, speaking, reading and writing, based on a sound foundation of core grammar and vocabulary. It should enable pupils to understand and communicate personal and factual information that goes beyond their immediate needs and interests, developing and justifying points of view in speech and writing, with increased spontaneity, independence and accuracy.

### Statutory Content — Grammar and Vocabulary

Pupils should be taught to:
- Identify and use tenses or other structures which convey the present, past, and future as appropriate to the language being studied
- Use and manipulate a variety of key grammatical structures and patterns, including voices and moods, as appropriate
- Develop and use a wide-ranging and deepening vocabulary that goes beyond their immediate needs and interests, allowing them to give and justify opinions and take part in discussion about wider issues
- Use accurate grammar, spelling and punctuation

### Statutory Content — Linguistic Competence

Pupils should be taught to:
- Listen to a variety of forms of spoken language to obtain information and respond appropriately
- Transcribe words and short sentences that they hear with increasing accuracy
- Initiate and develop conversations, coping with unfamiliar language and unexpected responses, making use of important social conventions such as formal modes of address
- Express and develop ideas clearly and with increasing accuracy, both orally and in writing
- Speak coherently and confidently, with increasingly accurate pronunciation and intonation
- Read and show comprehension of original and adapted materials from a range of different sources, understanding the purpose, important ideas and details, and provide an accurate English translation of short, suitable material
- Read literary texts in the language (such as stories, songs, poems and letters) to stimulate ideas, develop creative expression and expand understanding of the language and culture
- Write prose using an increasingly wide range of grammar and vocabulary, write creatively to express their own ideas and opinions, and translate short written text accurately into the foreign language

### Common Misconceptions and Challenges at KS3

- **"Start from scratch"** — The restart culture persists in many schools. Effective KS3 teaching should build on assessed KS2 knowledge, not repeat beginner content.
- **"Grammar can wait"** — The NC requires explicit grammar teaching from KS2. Delaying formal grammar instruction reduces the time available for developing complexity at KS3.
- **"Textbook = curriculum"** — A published scheme provides resources but is not a curriculum. Departments need a clear progression model that sequences phonics, vocabulary and grammar deliberately.

## Key Stage 4 and the EBacc

### Non-Statutory but Incentivised

MFL is not a compulsory subject at KS4, but it forms one of the five pillars of the English Baccalaureate (EBacc), alongside English, mathematics, sciences, and humanities. The government's stated ambition was for 90% of pupils to be entering the EBacc combination by 2025, though actual uptake remains far below this target.

### GCSE Uptake Data

The British Council's Language Trends surveys provide the most comprehensive data on MFL uptake:

- Teachers report that on average 53% of their Year 11 pupils are currently learning a language for GCSE — well short of the 90% EBacc target (Language Trends 2024)
- GCSE language take-up is significantly lower in less affluent state schools, with a gap of more than 20 percentage points compared to the most affluent schools (Language Trends 2025)
- 68% of the least affluent schools face difficulties recruiting language teachers
- GCSE reforms introduced in 2024 have been broadly welcomed, with 34.2% of teachers expecting increased uptake as a result

### Languages Available at GCSE

The main exam boards (AQA, Edexcel/Pearson, OCR) offer GCSEs in French, German and Spanish as their primary MFL subjects. Additional languages available include Italian, Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, Urdu, Polish, and others, with availability varying by board.

## Ofsted Research Review: Languages (2021)

### The Three Pillars of Progression

Ofsted's 2021 Curriculum Research Review for Languages identifies three "pillars of progression" that underpin high-quality language education:

1. **Phonics** — The sound system of the language, including sound-spelling correspondences, pronunciation patterns, and intonation. Systematic phonics teaching helps pupils decode and produce language accurately.

2. **Vocabulary** — Deliberate, cumulative vocabulary building using high-frequency words, cognates, and retrieval practice. Vocabulary should be carefully sequenced and regularly revisited.

3. **Grammar** — Explicit teaching of grammatical structures, sequenced logically so pupils can build increasingly complex sentences. Grammar should be taught in context, not as isolated rules.

The review emphasises that these three pillars interact — effective curriculum design sequences content across all three simultaneously, showing pupils how sounds, words and rules combine.

### Key Findings

- A high-quality languages curriculum is carefully planned around logical pupil progression in phonics, vocabulary and grammar, and the interplay between them
- Explicit instruction is identified as highly effective, provided it is based on a carefully considered and sequenced curriculum
- Teachers' use of the target language should be carefully planned and tailored to pupils' ability and prior knowledge
- Teachers should create regular opportunities for pupils to practise using the target language in meaningful contexts
- The curriculum should make connections between the language being studied and English (and other languages pupils know), helping pupils identify patterns and transferable skills

### Implications for Curriculum Design

The review identifies that high-quality languages education may have the following features:
- A carefully sequenced curriculum that builds systematically on prior learning
- Regular, spaced retrieval practice for vocabulary and grammar
- Phonics taught explicitly, particularly at KS2 and early KS3
- A balance between receptive skills (listening, reading) and productive skills (speaking, writing)
- Assessment that checks pupils' developing competence across all three pillars
- Professional development that builds teachers' subject knowledge and pedagogical expertise

## Teacher Recruitment and Retention

### The Staffing Crisis

MFL faces acute recruitment challenges nationally:

- 63% of state secondary schools report difficulties hiring MFL teachers (Language Trends 2025)
- Retention is particularly poor in areas with high deprivation
- Primary schools often lack staff with MFL subject knowledge, leading to variable quality of KS2 provision
- The National Centre for Excellence in Language Pedagogy (NCELP) was established to improve pedagogy and provide CPD, but was defunded in 2024

### Impact on Curriculum

Staff shortages directly affect curriculum quality. Schools with recruitment difficulties may:
- Reduce the number of languages offered
- Reduce KS3 curriculum time for MFL
- Use non-specialist teachers
- Rely heavily on textbook-led approaches without structured curriculum thinking

## Key Professional Bodies and Resources

| Organisation | Role |
|-------------|------|
| **ALL** (Association for Language Learning) | Professional body for language teachers; publishes Language Learning Journal; runs annual Language World conference |
| **British Council** | Publishes annual Language Trends survey; runs school partnerships and international opportunities |
| **NCELP** (National Centre for Excellence in Language Pedagogy) | Produced phonics, vocabulary and grammar resources aligned to Ofsted review; defunded 2024 |
| **Ofsted** | Publishes research reviews and conducts deep dives during inspection |
| **AQA, Edexcel, OCR** | Main exam boards for GCSE and A Level MFL specifications |

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Effective MFL Teaching Strategies

Based on the Ofsted research review and wider evidence base:

- **Systematic phonics instruction** — Explicitly teach sound-spelling correspondences in the target language, particularly at KS2 and early KS3
- **Spaced retrieval practice** — Regularly revisit previously taught vocabulary and grammar using low-stakes testing, flashcards, and interleaved practice
- **Modelling and scaffolding** — Demonstrate target language use, gradually removing support as pupils gain confidence
- **Target language use** — Maximise meaningful use of the target language in lessons, with careful planning to ensure comprehensibility
- **Translation** — Use both directions (L1→L2 and L2→L1) as a tool for deepening grammatical understanding
- **Extensive reading and listening** — Expose pupils to a range of authentic and adapted materials
- **Grammar as a tool** — Teach grammar explicitly but in service of communication, not as an end in itself

### Progression Across Key Stages

Effective MFL provision sequences learning so that:
- **KS2** establishes basic phonics, core vocabulary (~500-800 words), and foundational grammar (gender, articles, present tense of common verbs)
- **KS3** builds on KS2 foundations, extending to past and future tenses, more complex sentence structures, wider vocabulary (~1,500-2,000 words), and greater spontaneity
- **KS4** (for those continuing) develops accuracy, complexity, and the ability to discuss abstract topics, justify opinions, and engage with literary and cultural texts

## The EBacc Debate and MFL Policy

### Policy Context

The English Baccalaureate was introduced in 2010 as a school accountability measure. By including a modern or ancient foreign language as one of its five pillars, the government sought to reverse the decline in MFL entries that accelerated after languages became optional at KS4 in 2004.

### Arguments For the EBacc Approach

- Provides a clear signal that languages matter and should be studied by all pupils
- Counteracts the post-2004 decline that saw GCSE language entries fall dramatically
- Aligns England with most European countries where multiple languages are studied to 16
- Supports social mobility — pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds are least likely to study languages without external incentive

### Arguments Against

- The 90% target is unrealistic without addressing teacher supply
- Forcing reluctant learners into MFL GCSE risks high failure rates and disengagement
- The current grading system makes languages GCSEs statistically harder to achieve top grades in, discouraging uptake
- Time pressures on the KS4 curriculum mean something else must be dropped

### The Grading Debate

Research consistently shows that MFL GCSEs are among the most "severely graded" subjects. A pupil achieving grade 7 in French would, statistically, have been likely to achieve grade 8 or 9 in many other subjects. Ofqual has acknowledged this discrepancy. The reformed GCSEs introduced in 2024 aim to address some of these concerns, and early teacher responses have been cautiously positive.

## KS2 to KS3 Transition

### The Persistent Challenge

The transition from primary to secondary MFL teaching remains one of the most significant challenges in the system. Despite KS2 languages being statutory since 2014, secondary schools frequently report that:

- Pupils arrive with vastly different levels of prior knowledge
- Different primary schools teach different languages (French, Spanish, German, or even Mandarin)
- Quality of KS2 provision is highly variable — some schools offer systematic, well-taught programmes; others provide minimal or tokenistic coverage
- Secondary departments often lack information about what has been taught at feeder primaries

### Effective Transition Strategies

Evidence from Ofsted inspections and the ALL identifies several approaches that support effective transition:

- **Liaison with feeder primaries** — Secondary language departments that visit their feeder primaries, share curriculum plans, and assess incoming pupils can build on existing knowledge rather than restarting
- **Baseline assessment** — Formal assessment at the start of Year 7 helps identify what pupils already know and can do
- **Bridging units** — Curriculum materials designed to acknowledge prior learning while establishing a common foundation for the whole cohort
- **Shared curriculum frameworks** — Where secondary and primary schools collaborate on a common language and progression model (e.g., through a multi-academy trust), transition is significantly smoother
- **Celebration of prior learning** — Explicitly valuing what pupils learned at primary school maintains motivation and avoids the demoralising "back to square one" experience
