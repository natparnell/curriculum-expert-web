# KS2-KS3 Transition in Modern Foreign Languages

## Introduction: The Transition Challenge

The transition from Key Stage 2 to Key Stage 3 represents one of the most critical and challenging junctures in a pupil's language learning journey. Since the introduction of statutory languages teaching at Key Stage 2 in 2014, England has witnessed a significant expansion of primary language provision. However, as Ofsted's Research Review Series: Languages (2021) makes clear, "the lack of effective transition in languages from primary to secondary school means that many pupils across England 'start again' in Year 7." This phenomenon—often referred to as the "restart culture"—has profound implications for learner motivation, progression, and long-term outcomes in language learning.

The challenge is multifaceted. Primary schools may teach any modern or ancient foreign language, with French, Spanish, and German being the most common choices. Secondary schools, meanwhile, make their own decisions about which language to offer in Year 7. This often results in pupils changing languages at the point of transition, compounding the difficulty of building coherent progression. Furthermore, even where the same language continues, wide variation exists in the quantity and quality of primary language provision, leading to significant disparities in what pupils know and can do when they arrive in secondary school.

This document examines the theoretical foundations of effective transition, practical strategies for bridging the gap between primary and secondary phases, approaches to baseline assessment, and methods for avoiding the demotivating restart culture that undermines so many pupils' language learning experiences.

## Understanding the Research Evidence

### The Scope of the Problem

Research consistently demonstrates that primary-age learners begin their language learning journey with enthusiasm and high levels of intrinsic motivation. As the Research in Primary Languages (RIPL) project notes, young learners "value and enjoy language learning for its own sake, and also for the opportunities it brings for communication with, and learning about, people from other countries." This positivity should, theoretically, provide fertile ground for continued engagement at secondary level.

However, the reality is often starkly different. Multiple studies have documented a decline in motivation during Year 7, with some learners experiencing this drop from the very beginning of secondary school. Ofsted's research review identifies poor transition as "likely to be the most significant aspect in pupils not seeing the benefit of learning a language at primary school." When pupils feel their prior learning is unacknowledged or that they are simply repeating content they have already encountered, their motivation suffers accordingly.

### The Restart Culture

The "restart culture" in MFL refers to the common practice in secondary schools of treating all Year 7 pupils as complete beginners, regardless of their prior language learning experience. There are understandable reasons why this approach persists: teachers face classes with vastly disparate experiences, ranging from pupils who have had four years of regular French lessons to those who have had minimal or no language teaching. In this context, "starting from scratch" can seem like the only practicable solution.

However, the consequences of this approach are significant. For pupils who have engaged with language learning at primary school, repeating basic vocabulary and phrases feels like a waste of time. They may conclude that their primary learning was worthless, leading to disengagement and the perception that language lessons lack challenge. As one pupil told researchers: "We did all this in primary school. It's boring doing it again."

Moreover, the restart culture sends an implicit message that language learning is fragmented and non-cumulative, rather than a coherent progression where each stage builds upon the last. This fundamentally undermines the concept of progression that is central to effective curriculum design.

### Continuity of Language vs. Continuity of Learning

A crucial distinction emerges from the research literature between continuity of language (studying the same language at both phases) and continuity of learning (building systematically on prior knowledge and skills, regardless of whether the language changes).

While studying the same language throughout provides obvious advantages for curriculum continuity, the Ofsted research review and subsequent guidance from organisations such as HFL Education emphasise that successful transition "does not have to be dependent on studying the same language in both primary and secondary phase." Instead, it "can be enabled by being clear about the knowledge and skills that are applicable across languages and highlighting these to both staff and pupils."

This insight is particularly important given the practical realities of language provision in England. Many secondary schools cannot match the languages taught in all their feeder primaries due to staffing constraints, examination requirements, or strategic decisions about which languages to prioritise. In these circumstances, the focus must shift from maintaining the same language to ensuring that transferable skills and knowledge are recognised, valued, and built upon.

## Core Components of Effective Transition

### Language-Learning Skills

Certain competencies developed in primary language learning transfer readily to any new language. These transferable skills form the foundation of effective cross-language transition:

**Phonological Awareness and Sound-Spelling Correspondences**

Pupils who have learned to associate sounds with written forms in one language have developed a foundational skill that applies to any language. While specific sound-spelling relationships differ between languages, the meta-linguistic awareness that letters represent sounds—and that these relationships must be learned—is transferable. Furthermore, many phonemes are shared across European languages, particularly those most commonly taught in English schools.

Primary language programmes that explicitly teach phonics provide pupils with analytical tools they can apply to new languages. For instance, a pupil who has learned to read Spanish phonetically can apply the same decoding strategies to French, even though the specific correspondences differ. Secondary teachers can accelerate progress by explicitly acknowledging these transferable skills and showing pupils how their prior learning applies in the new context.

**Grammatical Concepts**

Exposure to grammatical concepts in any language prepares pupils to encounter similar concepts in other languages. Key areas of transferable grammatical knowledge include:

- **Noun gender**: Pupils who have encountered the concept that nouns have gender in French or Spanish understand this fundamental feature of Romance languages. This conceptual understanding transfers even when learning a new language with different gender markers.

- **Agreement systems**: Understanding that articles, adjectives, and verbs must agree with nouns represents a significant conceptual leap for monolingual English speakers. Pupils who have grappled with this in one language bring valuable prior knowledge to a second language.

- **Verb conjugation**: The recognition that verb endings change according to person and tense, unfamiliar in English but central to most languages taught in schools, develops through primary language learning and transfers across languages.

- **Formal and informal address**: The distinction between formal and informal "you" (tu/vous, tú/usted, du/Sie) represents a cultural and linguistic concept that pupils encountering for the first time in any language can apply to others.

**Language Learning Strategies**

Beyond specific linguistic knowledge, primary language learning develops general strategies for approaching new languages. These include techniques for memorising vocabulary, strategies for working out meaning from context, confidence in attempting pronunciation of unfamiliar words, and experience in using reference materials such as dictionaries. These meta-cognitive and meta-linguistic skills represent perhaps the most valuable transferable legacy of primary language learning.

### Core Vocabulary and High-Frequency Language

Even when pupils change languages at transition, certain vocabulary items and structures represent high-frequency, highly transferable language that pupils may have encountered in different forms. Personal information (name, age, family), descriptions (colours, sizes, characteristics), classroom language, and everyday activities appear across language curricula regardless of the specific language being taught.

The ASCL Transition Toolkits for French, Spanish, and German identify core linguistic content that pupils should have encountered by the end of Key Stage 2. While individual pupils' experience varies, this core provides a reference point for secondary teachers planning Year 7 curricula. The toolkits emphasise that pupils should have developed capacity in areas including:

- Personal identification and basic biographical information
- Numbers, dates, and time expressions
- Classroom objects and instructions
- Family and relationships
- Food and drink
- Leisure activities and interests

Secondary teachers who audit pupils' prior knowledge in these domains can identify what has already been learned and plan accordingly, rather than assuming universal ignorance.

## Bridging Strategies: Practical Approaches

### Communication Between Phases

Effective transition requires deliberate communication between primary and secondary schools. This communication should address both logistical and pedagogical dimensions:

**Information Transfer**

Secondary schools need detailed information about incoming pupils' language learning experiences. This includes:

- Which language(s) pupils have studied
- The amount of curriculum time devoted to languages
- The approaches and methodologies used
- Specific content and topics covered
- Attainment levels achieved

The ASCL/ALL KS2/KS3 Transition Toolkit recommends structured transition forms that primary teachers complete and secondary teachers use for planning. These forms capture information about pupils' linguistic competence as well as their experiences of language learning, including their confidence levels and attitudes.

**Professional Dialogue**

Beyond formal information transfer, opportunities for professional dialogue between primary and secondary practitioners enable deeper understanding of each phase's challenges and approaches. Joint training sessions, transition working groups, and shared planning exercises build mutual understanding and break down the artificial barriers that often separate primary and secondary phases.

Some schools have established innovative practices such as secondary teachers visiting primary classes, primary teachers contributing to Year 7 planning, or joint professional development focused specifically on transition. These initiatives recognise that effective transition is a shared responsibility requiring collaboration across phase boundaries.

### Curriculum Bridging

**The Bridge Unit Approach**

Many schools have developed explicit "bridge units" designed specifically for the Year 6-7 transition period. These units serve multiple purposes:

- Acknowledging and valuing pupils' prior learning
- Assessing what pupils know and can do
- Introducing secondary language learning expectations
- Building continuity whether or not the language changes

Effective bridge units begin by explicitly referencing prior learning. Pupils might review what they learned in primary school, create portfolios of their primary language work, or teach their new classmates phrases from their primary language. These activities signal that primary learning is valued and provide starting points for secondary teaching.

**Language-Specific Continuity**

Where pupils continue with the same language, curriculum planning must ensure genuine progression rather than repetition. This requires secondary teachers to understand what has been taught at primary level and to design learning that extends prior knowledge into new contexts.

For example, if pupils have learned to describe their family in French at primary school, secondary teaching might revisit this topic but introduce more complex relationships, additional adjectives, compound sentences, and different time frames. The topic provides continuity while the linguistic demands increase appropriately.

**Cross-Language Bridge Activities**

Where pupils change languages, bridge activities can explicitly focus on transferable skills. Pupils might:

- Compare sound-spelling correspondences between their primary language and the new language
- Identify cognates and false friends
- Apply vocabulary-learning strategies from their primary language to the new one
- Use their knowledge of grammatical concepts to predict patterns in the new language
- Reflect on their experience as language learners and set goals for secondary language learning

These activities make transferability explicit, helping pupils see that their primary language learning was not wasted even when the specific language changes.

### The Summer Bridge

The long summer holiday between Year 6 and Year 7 represents both a challenge and an opportunity. Without maintenance, language skills atrophy during this period. Some schools have addressed this through:

- **Transition homework**: Light-touch activities that maintain engagement with language during the summer, such as cultural exploration tasks, vocabulary games, or media consumption in the target language
- **Summer schools**: Intensive language programmes offered during the summer break, particularly valuable for pupils changing languages who need to establish foundations before Year 7 begins
- **Online resources**: curated collections of websites, apps, and materials that pupils can access independently to maintain their language skills

While summer activities cannot be compulsory, making them engaging and accessible encourages participation and helps maintain momentum through the transition period.

## Baseline Assessment: Purpose and Practice

### Principles of Effective Baseline Assessment

Baseline assessment in Year 7 serves diagnostic purposes: establishing what pupils know and can do, identifying areas for development, and informing curriculum planning. Effective baseline assessment in MFL must navigate several challenges:

**Accounting for Variable Prior Experience**

Unlike subjects with statutory curriculum requirements at both key stages, MFL exhibits enormous variation in primary provision. Some pupils arrive with four years of regular teaching from specialist teachers; others have had minimal exposure from non-specialists. Baseline assessment must accommodate this range without either patronising experienced learners or overwhelming beginners.

**Assessing Transferable Skills**

When pupils have studied different languages or had varying experiences, assessment should identify transferable skills and knowledge as well as specific linguistic competence. This might include:

- Phonological awareness and decoding skills
- Recognition of grammatical concepts
- Language learning strategies and meta-linguistic awareness
- Attitudes toward and confidence in language learning

**Formative Purpose**

Baseline assessment should be genuinely formative, designed to inform teaching rather than to label or stream pupils. The information gathered should directly influence curriculum planning, differentiation strategies, and individual support.

### Approaches to Baseline Assessment

**Portfolio and Self-Assessment**

Some schools use pupil portfolios from primary school, combined with self-assessment questionnaires, to establish baseline competence. Pupils might bring examples of their best primary language work, complete checklists of what they can do, and set personal targets for Year 7. This approach values pupils' own perspectives on their learning and engages them actively in the assessment process.

**Diagnostic Testing**

More formal diagnostic tests can identify specific linguistic competence, particularly where pupils continue with the same language. These assessments might cover listening, reading, speaking, and writing, mirroring the four skills framework that will structure their secondary language learning. However, such tests must be designed carefully to avoid the demotivation that comes from facing material that is either trivially easy or impossibly difficult.

**Language Aptitude Assessment**

For pupils changing languages, aptitude tests that focus on language-learning capability rather than specific knowledge offer an alternative approach. The Pimsleur Language Aptitude Battery and similar instruments assess abilities such as phonemic coding, grammatical sensitivity, and inductive language learning. However, these tools require specialist administration and interpretation.

More practically, classroom-based activities can assess language-learning aptitude through tasks involving:

- Recognising patterns in unfamiliar languages
- Remembering new vocabulary
- Reproducing unfamiliar sounds
- Working out rules from examples

These activities provide insights into pupils' readiness for language learning while engaging them in the kind of analytical thinking that successful language learning requires.

**Attitudes and Motivation Assessment**

Given the critical importance of motivation for language learning outcomes, some baseline assessment approaches explicitly probe pupils' attitudes, beliefs, and motivations. Questionnaires exploring pupils' enjoyment of primary language learning, their confidence in their abilities, their beliefs about the usefulness of languages, and their goals for secondary language learning provide valuable information for teachers seeking to maintain engagement through the challenging transition period.

### Using Baseline Assessment Data

The value of baseline assessment lies in its impact on teaching. Data gathered should inform:

**Curriculum Planning**

Baseline assessment reveals what needs to be taught and what can be assumed. Teachers can identify topics, structures, and skills that require attention and those that can be addressed more quickly due to pupils' prior knowledge.

**Differentiation Strategies**

Wide variation in prior attainment necessitates sophisticated differentiation. Baseline data enables teachers to group pupils flexibly, provide targeted support, and design activities with appropriate challenge levels.

**Setting Realistic Expectations**

Understanding pupils' starting points enables teachers to set realistic yet challenging targets. Progress measures should recognise distance travelled from individual starting points rather than comparing all pupils against uniform standards.

**Tracking Progress**

Baseline data provides the starting point for tracking progress through Key Stage 3. Regular assessment against clearly defined criteria enables teachers and pupils to monitor development and identify when interventions are needed.

## Avoiding the Restart Culture: Pedagogical Strategies

### The "Not Starting from Scratch" Narrative

Language teachers must explicitly communicate to pupils that their prior learning is valued and will be built upon. This messaging should permeate all aspects of Year 7 teaching:

- **Explicit acknowledgement**: Teachers should regularly reference what pupils learned at primary school, whether in the same or a different language
- **Progression framing**: Units and lessons should be framed as "extending" or "developing" prior learning rather than "starting"
- **Pupil expertise**: Opportunities should be created for pupils to share their prior learning with peers, positioning them as knowledgeable contributors to the classroom community
- **Making transfer visible**: When teaching new content, teachers should explicitly connect it to prior learning, helping pupils see how their knowledge is growing

### Differentiation for Mixed Experience Classes

The reality of mixed-experience Year 7 classes requires thoughtful differentiation:

**Tiered Activities**

Tasks can be designed with multiple tiers, allowing more experienced learners to work at greater depth while less experienced learners focus on foundations. For example, a writing task might require all pupils to produce simple sentences, with extension challenges involving compound sentences, additional details, or different time frames for those with prior knowledge to draw upon.

**Expert Grouping**

Strategic grouping can leverage the expertise of more experienced learners while supporting those with less prior knowledge. Pairing pupils with complementary experiences enables peer teaching and collaborative learning. However, such grouping must be managed carefully to avoid stigmatising less experienced learners or creating excessive demands on those with more knowledge.

**Choice and Pathways**

Offering pupils choices within tasks allows them to work at appropriate challenge levels. A menu of activities, options for extension, or alternative routes through material enables self-directed differentiation based on pupils' assessment of their own capabilities.

### Acceleration Pathways

For pupils with substantial primary language learning, acceleration pathways may be appropriate:

- **Fast-track groups**: Some schools organise Year 7 classes by experience, allowing those with strong foundations to progress more rapidly
- **Extension activities**: Regular extension challenges provide additional depth for those ready to go beyond core expectations
- **Vertical grouping**: In some schools, experienced Year 7 pupils join Year 8 or even Year 9 classes for language lessons
- **Early entry**: Pupils with exceptional prior attainment might be entered for GCSE early, freeing curriculum time for additional languages or enrichment

However, acceleration approaches must be implemented cautiously. Social and emotional factors, as well as linguistic competence, must be considered when placing pupils in groups with older students or pushing them through examinations prematurely.

### Revisiting and Extending

When prior content must be revisited, pedagogical approaches should ensure that pupils experience this as extension rather than repetition:

**New Contexts**

Known vocabulary and structures should be applied in unfamiliar contexts. If pupils have learned colours to describe objects, secondary teaching might apply the same colours to describe abstract art, sports team kits, or
