# A Level Modern Foreign Languages: Literary Texts, Film Study, and the Independent Research Project

## Overview

A Level Modern Foreign Languages (MFL) represents a significant transition from GCSE, requiring students to engage deeply with authentic cultural materials including literary texts, films, and independent research. The specifications from AQA, Pearson Edexcel, and OCR share common structural elements while offering distinct approaches to assessment and content selection.

The current A Level MFL specifications were introduced for first teaching in September 2016, following the DfE's GCE AS and A Level Subject Content for Modern Foreign Languages (July 2023 revision). These qualifications require students to study either one literary text and one film, or two literary texts, alongside conducting an independent research project (IRP) that forms a substantial component of the speaking assessment.

## The DfE Subject Content Requirements

### Statutory Framework

The Department for Education's subject content document (DFE-00694-2014, revised July 2023) establishes the mandatory requirements that all awarding organisations must follow. The content is designed to build upon GCSE foundations while introducing greater intellectual challenge and cultural depth.

**Key requirements include:**

- **Cultural knowledge**: Students must demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the society, culture, and history of countries where the target language is spoken
- **Literary and cinematic study**: All students must engage with works of literature and film in the target language
- **Independent research**: Students must conduct independent research on a subject of their choice relating to target-language countries
- **Language skills**: Development of sophisticated linguistic competence across listening, speaking, reading, and writing

The DfE's revised guidance (July 2023) clarified grammar requirements and added an annex detailing exceptions for Chinese AS and A Level qualifications, reflecting the specific challenges of teaching and assessing non-European languages.

## Literary Texts and Film Study

### Selection Requirements

All major exam boards (AQA, Pearson Edexcel, OCR) require students to study either:

- **Option A**: One literary text and one film
- **Option B**: Two literary texts

This requirement occupies approximately one-third of teaching time during the A Level course. Most departments choose Option A, typically teaching the film in Year 12 and the literary text in Year 13, though practice varies.

### AQA Set Texts and Films

**French (7652)**

Literary texts include classic and contemporary works:
- Molière: *Le Tartuffe* (1664)
- Voltaire: *Candide* (1759)
- Guy de Maupassant: *Boule de Suif et autres contes de la guerre* (1880)
- Albert Camus: *L'Étranger* (1942)
- Françoise Sagan: *Bonjour tristesse* (1954)
- Claire Etcherelli: *Élise ou la vraie vie* (1967)
- Joseph Joffo: *Un sac de billes* (1973)
- Faïza Guène: *Kiffe kiffe demain* (2004)
- Philippe Grimbert: *Un secret* (2004)
- Delphine de Vigan: *No et moi* (2007)

Films include landmark works of French and Francophone cinema:
- *Les 400 coups* (François Truffaut, 1959)
- *Au revoir les enfants* (Louis Malle, 1987)
- *La Haine* (Mathieu Kassovitz, 1995)
- *L'Auberge espagnole* (Cédric Klapisch, 2002)
- *Un long dimanche de fiançailles* (Jean-Pierre Jeunet, 2004)
- *Entre les murs* (Laurent Cantet, 2008)

**Spanish and German**

AQA offers comparable lists for Spanish and German, including works such as:
- Spanish: *La casa de Bernarda Alba* (Lorca), *Volver* (Pedro Almodóvar, 2006), *Mar adentro* (Alejandro Amenábar, 2004)
- German: *Der Vorleser* (Bernhard Schlink), *Die Verwandlung* (Kafka), *Good Bye, Lenin!* (Wolfgang Becker, 2003), *Das Leben der Anderen* (Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, 2006)

### Pearson Edexcel Specifications

Edexcel's specifications follow similar principles while offering a distinct range of texts and films. Their approach emphasises:

- Critical and analytical response development
- Selection of relevant material from studied works
- Presentation and justification of viewpoints
- Development of arguments with evidence from texts
- Drawing conclusions based on understanding
- Evaluation of thematic and cultural issues

### Pedagogical Approaches to Film Study

#### Selecting Films

When selecting a film, experienced practitioners recommend considering:

**Linguistic accessibility**: The film should provide comprehensible input. Students benefit from clear dialogue and the ability to follow narrative without excessive reliance on visual cues. English subtitles are essential for independent viewing.

**Thematic connections**: While not mandatory, linking films to specification themes can deepen understanding. For example, *La Haine* connects naturally to themes of marginalisation and urban violence, while *Entre les murs* addresses education and multiculturalism.

**Scope for analysis**: Films should offer rich material for cinematographic analysis including:
- *Mise-en-scène* (setting, costume, lighting)
- Camera techniques (angles, shots, movement)
- Sound design and musical score
- Editing and narrative structure
- Symbolism and visual metaphors

**Cultural significance**: Films that illuminate aspects of target-language societies offer valuable cultural learning opportunities. The French New Wave (*Les 400 coups*), post-war German identity (*Good Bye, Lenin!*), or Spanish rural traditions (*Volver*) all provide cultural insights.

#### Planning and Organisation

Most departments allocate 10–12 weeks to film study, assuming approximately two hours of classroom contact plus two hours of homework weekly. Steve Smith (frenchteacher.net) recommends the following preparation:

**Pre-teaching preparation**:
- Watch the film at least twice before teaching
- Create a scene-by-scene summary with timings, locations, characters, and musical cues
- Research film-making techniques and critical vocabulary
- Study the director's wider work and historical context
- Prepare approximately eight worksheets dividing the film into manageable sections

**Worksheet design** should balance language learning with critical analysis:
- Bilingual vocabulary glossaries for key terms
- True/false comprehension questions
- Target-language questions ranging from factual recall to open-ended analysis
- Occasional L1 questions for complex conceptual content
- Character identification and quotation attribution
- Film technique description exercises
- Gap-fill summaries
- Grammar exercises based on encountered structures
- Transcription of key dialogues

#### The Viewing Process

Effective film pedagogy typically follows this sequence:

1. **Pre-viewing**: Establish context, introduce key vocabulary, and preview themes
2. **First viewing**: Watch the complete film uninterrupted with captions, experiencing it as a film audience would
3. **Section-by-section study**: Work through the film in 8–10 sections over several weeks
4. **Pre-lesson preparation**: Students complete worksheet tasks before class discussion
5. **Classroom discussion**: Compare responses, develop analysis, and practise expressing ideas in the target language
6. **Consolidation**: Written summaries, technique analysis, and thematic exploration

#### Developing Essay Skills

The transition from comprehension to critical essay writing requires explicit instruction:

- **Modelling**: Show exemplary essays with analysis of their structure and argumentation
- **Scaffolding**: Provide sentence starters, essay frameworks, and planning templates
- **Practice**: Regular low-stakes writing tasks building to full essays
- **Feedback**: Targeted feedback on both language accuracy and analytical depth
- **Revision**: Opportunities to redraft based on feedback

### Teaching Literary Texts

#### Text Selection

When selecting literary texts, departments should consider:

**Linguistic challenge**: Texts must stretch students without overwhelming them. Abridged editions are explicitly prohibited by all exam boards.

**Thematic richness**: Texts should offer multiple angles for interpretation and connection to contemporary issues.

**Cultural authenticity**: Works by target-language authors provide authentic cultural perspectives.

**Teaching resources**: Availability of critical commentary, study guides, and teaching materials supports effective delivery.

#### Pedagogical Strategies

The British Film Institute (BFI) and experienced practitioners recommend:

**Contextual grounding**: Establish historical, social, and biographical context before deep textual study.

**Close reading**: Teach students to analyse language at word, sentence, and paragraph levels, noting stylistic features.

**Critical vocabulary**: Develop metalanguage for discussing narrative techniques, characterisation, symbolism, and themes.

**Comparative analysis**: Where two texts are studied, explicit teaching of comparison techniques is essential.

**Target language discussion**: While complex ideas may initially be explored in English, sustained practice in expressing analysis in the target language is crucial for examination success.

## The Independent Research Project (IRP)

### Purpose and Aims

The Independent Research Project (IRP) serves multiple educational purposes:

- Developing genuine research skills including source selection, information synthesis, and critical evaluation
- Encouraging intellectual curiosity and independent learning
- Preparing students for university-level study
- Providing a personalised element within the standardised specification
- Demonstrating ability to initiate and conduct individual research

The DfE and all exam boards emphasise that the IRP is not merely a presentation task but a research project requiring students to "analyse and summarise findings" and "present and discuss them in the speaking assessment."

### Requirements and Constraints

**Topic selection**:
- Must relate to a country or countries where the target language is spoken
- Can connect to specification themes or sub-themes
- Can relate to the literary text or film being studied
- **Critical restriction**: Students must not base their research on the same literary text or film they use for their written assessment

**Individuality requirements**:
- Each student within a school or college should choose a different subject
- If students select the same general area, their specific titles and approaches must differ substantially

**Research expectations**:
- Students must select relevant information from a range of sources
- Internet research is explicitly permitted and expected
- Sources should include target-language materials
- Students must demonstrate ability to analyse and summarise findings

### The A-Level Content Advisory Board (ALCAB) Guidance

ALCAB (now part of the Gatsby Charitable Foundation's education work) published indicative lists of research topics to guide teachers and students. These cover:

- Aspects of French/Spanish/German society
- Artistic culture
- Current trends and issues
- Political life
- Historical topics
- Regional studies

The ALCAB guidance stresses that these lists are illustrative, not restrictive, encouraging students to pursue genuine interests.

### Managing the IRP Process

#### Timeline and Milestones

Effective IRP management typically follows this pattern:

**Year 12, Summer Term**:
- Introduction to IRP requirements
- Exploration of potential topics
- Initial research and source gathering
- Topic approval and refinement

**Year 13, Autumn Term**:
- Sustained research period
- Regular monitoring meetings with teachers
- Development of presentation materials
- Practice presentations and feedback

**Spring Term**:
- Final preparation for speaking examination
- Mock examinations incorporating IRP
- Refinement based on mock feedback

#### Teacher Support and Monitoring

The AQA Teaching Guide for the Individual Research Project recommends:

**Structured guidance**: Provide clear frameworks for topic selection, research planning, and presentation preparation.

**Regular monitoring**: Schedule individual meetings to review progress, challenge assumptions, and suggest additional sources.

**Research skills instruction**: Explicitly teach:
- Source evaluation and credibility assessment
- Note-taking and information synthesis
- Citation and avoiding plagiarism
- Developing arguments from evidence

**Presentation preparation**: Guide students in:
- Structuring a coherent two-minute presentation
- Anticipating follow-up questions
- Expanding on points with evidence
- Using appropriate register and discourse markers

**Assessment criteria familiarisation**: Ensure students understand how their work will be assessed, particularly:
- Knowledge and understanding of the target-language culture
- Ability to present viewpoints and arguments
- Quality of language
- Responsiveness to questions

### Common Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge**: Students select topics that are too broad
**Solution**: Require focused research questions with clear parameters. "German cinema" becomes "The representation of East German identity in post-reunification cinema."

**Challenge**: Over-reliance on English sources
**Solution**: Set expectations for minimum proportions of target-language sources; teach strategies for accessing and comprehending authentic materials.

**Challenge**: Presentation becomes mere description
**Solution**: Emphasise analytical depth; require clear arguments and conclusions rather than information summaries.

**Challenge**: Nervousness in the speaking examination
**Solution**: Provide extensive practice opportunities; conduct mock examinations; teach stress management techniques; focus on genuine engagement with the topic rather than rehearsed responses.

## Assessment Structures

### AQA Assessment

**Paper 1: Listening, Reading and Writing** (2 hours 30 minutes, 50% of A Level)
- Listening comprehension
- Reading comprehension and translation into English
- Translation into the target language

**Paper 2: Writing** (2 hours, 20% of A Level)
- Two essays: one on the literary text, one on the film (or two on literary texts if Option B selected)
- Critical and analytical responses of approximately 300 words each

**Paper 3: Speaking** (21–23 minutes including supervised preparation, 30% of A Level)
- Part 1: Discussion of a stimulus card relating to specification themes (5–6 minutes)
- Part 2: Presentation (2 minutes) and discussion (9–10 minutes) of the Independent Research Project

### Pearson Edexcel Assessment

Edexcel structures assessment similarly:
- **Paper 1**: Translation and written response to works
- **Paper 2**: Written response to film/literature and translation
- **Paper 3**: Speaking examination including IRP

The key distinction lies in the specific works available and certain assessment rubric details.

## Pedagogical Best Practice

### Integrating Language and Content

The most effective A Level MFL teaching integrates linguistic development with cultural and intellectual content:

- **Vocabulary development**: Systematically build topic-specific lexis while teaching texts and films
- **Grammar in context**: Use literary and cinematic materials to illustrate advanced grammatical structures
- **Register awareness**: Help students distinguish between formal academic register and conversational language
- **Discourse competence**: Teach cohesive devices and argumentation structures necessary for essay writing

### Developing Critical Thinking

The specification's emphasis on analysis requires explicit critical thinking instruction:

- **Question formulation**: Teach students to formulate productive analytical questions
- **Evidence evaluation**: Develop ability to assess source credibility and select appropriate supporting evidence
- **Argument construction**: Model how to build coherent arguments with claims, evidence, and reasoning
- **Multiple perspectives**: Encourage consideration of alternative interpretations and viewpoints

### Using Technology and Resources

**Online resources**:
- Exam board websites provide specifications, past papers, and teaching guides
- The BFI offers CPD and teaching resources for film study
- Frenchteacher.net, dolanguages.com, and similar sites provide ready-to-use materials
- Streaming services enable flexible film viewing with subtitle options

**Professional development**:
- Subject association conferences (ALL, ISMLA)
- Exam board training events
- University outreach programmes
- Online communities and social media groups for resource sharing

### Differentiation and Support

**For students requiring additional support**:
- Modified worksheets with additional scaffolding
- Extended timelines for independent work
- Alternative assessment formats where appropriate
- Focused vocabulary pre-teaching

**For more able students**:
- Extension reading beyond set texts
- Opportunities for independent research beyond the IRP
- Engagement with critical theory and secondary literature
- Participation in external competitions and cultural events

## Transition and Progression

### From GCSE to A Level

The transition from GCSE to A Level MFL requires careful management:

- **Expectation setting**: Make explicit the increased demands and different nature of A Level study
- **Skill building**: Focus initial Year 12 work on developing necessary analytical and linguistic foundations
- **Confidence building**: Start with accessible materials before progressing to challenging texts
- **Study skills**: Explicitly teach note-taking, essay planning, and independent research skills

### Progression to Higher Education

A Level MFL provides excellent preparation for:
- Modern Languages degrees
- Combined degrees (Language and Business, Language and Law, etc.)
- International relations and politics
- Translation and interpreting courses
- Teaching qualifications

The research, analytical, and presentational skills developed through the IRP, literary study, and film analysis are highly transferable to university-level work.

## Conclusion

A Level Modern Foreign Languages specifications present a coherent and challenging framework that balances linguistic development with cultural engagement. The requirements to study literary texts, films, and conduct independent research ensure that students develop not only language proficiency but also critical thinking, research skills, and cultural understanding.

Successful implementation requires careful planning, resource development, and sustained attention to both language acquisition and intellectual challenge. Departments that invest in teacher expertise, build systematic schemes of work, and foster genuine student engagement with target-language cultures achieve the best outcomes.

The specification's structure—combining prescribed works with independent research—offers a productive balance between standardisation (ensuring comparability) and personalisation (allowing students to pursue genuine interests). When well taught, A Level MFL develops knowledgeable, linguistically capable, and culturally aware young people prepared for global citizenship.
