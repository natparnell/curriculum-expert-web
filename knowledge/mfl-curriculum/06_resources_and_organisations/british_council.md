# The British Council: Languages Programmes and School Partnerships

## Introduction

The **British Council** stands as the United Kingdom's principal cultural relations organisation, playing a pivotal role in supporting language education across England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. For modern foreign language (MFL) teachers, the British Council offers an extensive portfolio of resources, research, accreditation schemes, and partnership opportunities that directly impact classroom practice and curriculum development.

This knowledge file provides a comprehensive overview of the British Council's key language education initiatives, with particular focus on three flagship programmes: the **Language Trends research series**, which tracks the health of language teaching across the UK; the **International School Award (ISA)**, which accredits schools for their international work; and the **Language Assistants programme**, which brings native speakers into UK classrooms.

## The Language Trends Research Series

### Overview and Purpose

The **Language Trends** survey represents the most extensive annual research into language teaching in UK schools. Conducted by the British Council in collaboration with the Association for Language Learning (ALL) and other partners, this research provides essential intelligence about the state of MFL education, tracking patterns over time and identifying emerging challenges and opportunities.

The survey series now covers all four UK nations:
- **Language Trends England** (annual since 2002)
- **Language Trends Wales** (annual since 2015)
- **Language Trends Northern Ireland** (biennial since 2019)
- **Language Trends Scotland** (first survey in 2024)

### Key Findings from Language Trends England 2024

The 2024 report revealed several critical trends affecting language education in English schools:

#### The Teacher Recruitment Crisis

Perhaps the most alarming finding from the 2024 survey was that **60% of schools in England reported challenges hiring qualified language teachers**. This figure represents a significant barrier to expanding or even maintaining language provision. The British Academy described this as a "vicious circle": university language departments have closed (14 in the last decade alone), reducing the pool of graduates entering teacher training.

MFL recruitment to initial teacher training reached only **33% of its target in 2024/25**, placing languages among the most severely affected secondary subjects alongside physics (17% of target).

#### Curriculum Narrowing at Secondary Level

The 2023 research found that **two-thirds of secondary state schools were teaching just one modern foreign language**. This narrowing of provision limits student choice and reflects the pressure schools face when qualified staff are scarce. Spanish has overtaken French as the most popular A-level language for the fourth consecutive year.

#### Primary Language Provision

At primary level, nearly **nine out of ten primary schools have pupils for whom English is an additional language**, representing a significant linguistic resource. However, the quality and consistency of language provision varies considerably.

### Using Language Trends in Schools

Language Trends reports serve multiple purposes for school leaders and MFL teachers:

**Strategic Planning**: The data helps schools benchmark their provision against national trends and make informed decisions about language offerings.

**Advocacy**: Language departments can use Language Trends data to make the case for additional resources, demonstrating the national context for local challenges.

**Professional Development**: Understanding sector-wide trends helps teachers contextualise their experiences and identify successful approaches used elsewhere.

## The International School Award (ISA)

### Accreditation Framework

The **International School Award** is a British Council accreditation scheme that recognises schools having a notable global dimension in their curriculum. Established in 1999, the programme has accredited over 1,000 schools worldwide, providing a structured framework for embedding international education.

The ISA operates through three entry points:

#### Foundation Certificate

The entry-level accreditation requires schools to demonstrate initial engagement with international activities. Schools must complete at least one collaborative international activity with a partner school abroad.

#### Intermediate Certificate

Schools at this level show sustained commitment to international education, with multiple collaborative activities across different subject areas. The intermediate level requires evidence of how international partnerships have impacted teaching and learning.

#### Full Accreditation (Top Level)

The highest level of accreditation recognises schools where international education is fully embedded across the curriculum and whole-school ethos. Top-level accredited schools receive:
- An award logo for website and communications
- A branded ISA plaque
- Recognition at British Council events
- Case study opportunities showcasing best practice

### Benefits for Language Teaching

The ISA offers particular value for MFL departments:

**Authentic Communication**: Partnerships with schools in target language countries provide authentic contexts for language use. Pupils communicate with peers for real purposes, dramatically increasing motivation and engagement.

**Cultural Understanding**: International partnerships develop intercultural competence alongside linguistic skills, addressing the cultural dimension of the National Curriculum programmes of study.

**Professional Development**: Teachers involved in international partnerships often report renewed enthusiasm for language teaching and opportunities to develop their own language skills through collaboration with colleagues abroad.

### Application Process

Schools apply for ISA accreditation through the British Council's online portal. The application requires:
- Evidence of international activities (photographs, pupil work, testimonials)
- Descriptions of collaborative projects with partner schools
- Reflection on impact on teaching and learning
- Plans for sustaining and developing international work

The British Council provides guidance documents, webinars, and template materials to support applications. Accreditation lasts for three years.

## The Language Assistants Programme

### Programme Overview

The **Language Assistants programme**, established in 1905, is one of the British Council's longest-running and most impactful initiatives. It brings native speakers of French, German, Spanish, Italian, Mandarin Chinese, and other languages into UK schools, colleges, and universities to support language teaching and provide authentic linguistic and cultural input.

#### Scale and Reach

In 2024, the British Council's Language Assistants programme:
- Sent 1,800 English Language Assistants from 85 UK universities to teach English to over 400,000 pupils abroad
- Welcomed foreign Language Assistants into UK schools to support MFL teaching
- Placed assistants in primary schools, secondary schools, colleges, and universities across all four UK nations

### Benefits for UK Schools

Hosting a Language Assistant offers multiple benefits:

**Authentic Language Model**: Pupils hear native pronunciation and natural speech patterns, developing listening skills and phonological awareness.

**Cultural Insights**: Assistants bring first-hand knowledge of their countries' cultures, traditions, and contemporary life, enriching the cultural dimension of language teaching.

**Small Group Support**: Assistants can work with small groups or individuals, providing focused speaking practice that is difficult to achieve in whole-class settings.

**Professional Development**: Working alongside native speakers develops teachers' own language skills and provides insights into target language cultures.

**Pupil Motivation**: The presence of a young, enthusiastic native speaker often increases pupil interest in continuing language study.

### Employing a Language Assistant

Schools interested in hosting a Language Assistant should contact the British Council at **LanguageAssistants.UK@BritishCouncil.org**. The process involves:

1. **Application**: Schools specify their requirements (language, level, timing)
2. **Matching**: The British Council matches schools with suitable candidates
3. **Preparation**: Assistants receive pre-departure training; schools receive guidance on integration
4. **Support**: Ongoing support throughout the placement from British Council staff

#### Cost Considerations

Schools contribute to the assistant's salary, though costs are subsidised. The British Council provides detailed cost information and can advise on funding sources.

### Best Practice for Language Assistant Integration

To maximise the impact of a Language Assistant, schools should consider:

**Clear Role Definition**: Establish clear expectations about the assistant's role, including teaching, small group work, cultural activities, and resource development.

**Induction**: Provide thorough induction covering school policies, safeguarding procedures, curriculum context, and practical matters.

**Timetable Integration**: Build the assistant into the timetable strategically, ensuring they work across year groups and ability ranges.

**Collaborative Planning**: Involve the assistant in planning, allowing them to contribute cultural context and authentic materials.

## Languages for the Future Report

### Identifying Priority Languages

The British Council's **Languages for the Future** report identifies the ten languages most important for the UK's future prosperity, security, and global influence. The 2017 update confirmed the findings of the 2013 original report, with the same five languages topping the list:

1. **Spanish**
2. **Mandarin Chinese**
3. **French**
4. **Arabic**
5. **German**

These five appear "some way ahead" of the next five: Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Japanese, and Russian.

### Criteria for Selection

The report uses a balanced scorecard approach, weighing:
- **Current UK export markets**: Languages spoken in countries where the UK does significant business
- **Emerging markets**: Languages of growing economies with future trading potential
- **Diplomatic and security priorities**: Languages relevant to UK foreign policy and security needs
- **Public and cultural engagement**: Languages that facilitate cultural exchange and soft power
- **Education and research**: Languages supporting academic collaboration and research partnerships
- **UK diaspora communities**: Languages spoken by significant communities within the UK

### Implications for Schools

The Languages for the Future report provides valuable guidance for schools making decisions about their language provision:

**Curriculum Planning**: While schools must work within staffing constraints, the report helps identify which languages offer the greatest long-term value to pupils.

**Resource Allocation**: When investing in new resources or equipment, schools can prioritise materials supporting priority languages.

**Partnership Development**: Schools seeking international partners might prioritise connections with countries where priority languages are spoken.

**Careers Guidance**: The report provides evidence for careers advisers discussing the benefits of language study with pupils and parents.

### The UK Languages Deficit

The Languages for the Future report highlights an "alarming shortage" of language skills in the UK workforce. With 70% of UK businesses surveyed expressing demand for language skills, and particular shortages in the priority languages, the report makes a compelling case for expanding language education at all levels.

## Challenges and Considerations

### Managing Partnerships

International partnerships require significant investment of teacher time. Schools must balance the benefits against the demands of:
- **Communication**: Coordinating with partners across time zones
- **Planning**: Developing joint activities that meet both schools' curriculum needs
- **Administration**: Managing logistics, safeguarding, and funding

### Safeguarding

All international school partnerships must comply with safeguarding requirements:
- Secure communication platforms (eTwinning provides this)
- Appropriate teacher supervision of pupil interactions
- Clear protocols for sharing images and personal information
- Safeguarding checks on visiting teachers or host families

The British Council provides detailed safeguarding guidance for all its programmes.

### Sustainability

The most common challenge in international partnerships is sustaining activity beyond initial enthusiasm. Strategies for sustainability include:
- Embedding partnerships in curriculum planning
- Involving multiple teachers to spread workload
- Building relationships at leadership level, not just between individual teachers
- Securing dedicated time and resources for international work

### Equity and Access

Schools should consider how international opportunities are distributed:
