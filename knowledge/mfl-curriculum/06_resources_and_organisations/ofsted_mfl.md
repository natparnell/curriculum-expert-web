# Ofsted and Modern Foreign Languages

## Introduction

Ofsted's approach to evaluating Modern Foreign Languages (MFL) provision in English schools has undergone significant transformation since the introduction of the Education Inspection Framework (EIF) in 2019. The move toward a 'quality of education' focus, assessed through subject deep dives, has fundamentally changed how MFL departments prepare for and experience inspection. This knowledge base examines the three pillars of Ofsted's approach to MFL: the research reviews that underpin inspection methodology, the curriculum quality indicators that inspectors seek, and the deep dive framework through which evidence is gathered.

Understanding Ofsted's approach to MFL matters profoundly for curriculum leaders and teachers because the framework shapes not only inspection experiences but broader curriculum decision-making. The research reviews, in particular, have been influential in promoting particular approaches to curriculum design—particularly the emphasis on explicit instruction in phonics, vocabulary, and grammar—while the deep dive methodology requires departments to articulate their curriculum rationale with clarity and precision.

## The Ofsted Research Reviews: Foundations of Quality

### Purpose and Methodology

In June 2021, Ofsted published its Curriculum Research Review for Languages, the first in a series of subject-specific reviews exploring the literature relating to foreign languages education. The purpose was to identify factors contributing to high-quality languages curriculum, assessment, pedagogy, and systems. Unlike statutory guidance, the research review does not prescribe an 'Ofsted curriculum'; rather, it identifies features that "high-quality languages education may have."

The research review draws on extensive academic literature spanning cognitive science, linguistics, and language education research. It synthesises evidence about how languages are learned, what supports effective instruction, and what barriers impede progress. The review has proved influential—some would argue controversial—in shaping discourse about MFL curriculum design, particularly through its emphasis on the 'three pillars of progression': phonics, vocabulary, and grammar.

### The Three Pillars of Progression

The Ofsted research review identifies phonics, vocabulary, and grammar as the foundational building blocks of language learning. These are presented not as reductivist simplifications but as the essential components that enable the broader goals of language education: fluent communication, cultural understanding, and economic opportunity.

#### Phonics

The review emphasises that explicit phonics instruction is essential, particularly given the differences between English and target language sound systems. Key recommendations include:

- Curriculums should have clear, logical plans for phonics progression, including explicit attention to differences between the target language and English
- Planned practice and review of grapheme-phoneme correspondences should be built into the curriculum
- Small differences in sounds that affect meaning should be explicitly taught
- Phonics should be embedded from the earliest stages of language learning

The research evidence suggests that knowledge of the target language's phonetic code positively impacts pupil self-efficacy—their belief in their ability to learn the language. Without secure phonics knowledge, pupils struggle to decode spoken and written language, creating a barrier to all subsequent learning.

#### Vocabulary

The relationship between vocabulary knowledge and language proficiency is well-established in research. The Ofsted review highlights that the 2,000 most frequent words in a language comprise more than 80% of words in most written and spoken discourse. Curriculum implications include:

- Vocabulary selection should be based on frequency and utility rather than topic coverage alone
- Thematic vocabulary should be selected for its capacity to be used across multiple contexts
- Pupils need opportunities to practise vocabulary in both reception and production, in both written and spoken modes
- Vocabulary knowledge includes not just recognition but depth—understanding synonyms, antonyms, figurative meanings, and grammatical function

Milton's framework for assessing vocabulary knowledge provides a useful structure: how many words do pupils know (breadth), how well can they adapt their usage (depth), and how automatic is their recall (fluency)?

#### Grammar

Grammar enables pupils to manipulate language creatively rather than relying solely on fixed phrases. The review emphasises:

- Progress in grammar needs careful sequencing from simpler to more complex structures
- The Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) provides useful guidance for grammatical progression
- Grammar should be taught explicitly, though incidental learning also contributes
- Systematic practice in a range of contexts is essential for mastery

Curriculum leaders should consider several factors when sequencing grammar: how easily the structure can be spotted, how easy it is to understand its function, how useful/frequent it is, how different it is from English, and how generalisable and regular it is.

### Principles of Curriculum Design

Beyond the three pillars, the Ofsted research review articulates several principles for effective curriculum design:

**Progress means knowing more and remembering more:** The curriculum should be structured to build knowledge systematically over time, with clear progression in what pupils know and can do.

**Working memory limitations:** Overloading learners with content negatively affects learning quality. Less can be more. Distributed practice (short, regular sessions) is more effective than massed practice (longer, less frequent sessions).

**Retrieval practice:** Regular retrieval of previously learned content supports long-term memory development and should be built into curriculum planning.

**Explicit instruction:** Research suggests explicit teaching is particularly effective for novice learners, though this does not preclude opportunities for implicit learning and creative language use as proficiency develops.

**Automaticity:** Initial language learning is effortful and error-prone. Through practice, knowledge becomes automatic, freeing cognitive capacity for higher-order processing such as inference-making and nuanced comprehension.

## Curriculum Quality Indicators

### The Three Is: Intent, Implementation, Impact

Ofsted's evaluation of MFL, like other subjects, is structured around the 'three Is'—intent, implementation, and impact. These provide a framework for inspectors to gather evidence about curriculum quality.

#### Intent

Intent refers to what schools intend pupils to learn and why. For MFL, strong curriculum intent is evidenced by:

**Clear rationale:** A coherent explanation of why particular languages are taught, why particular content is selected, and how the curriculum addresses the school's context and pupils' needs. The rationale should address questions such as: Why French rather than Spanish? Why this vocabulary rather than that? How does the curriculum build toward defined endpoints?

**Ambitious endpoints:** Clear understanding of what pupils should know and be able to do by the end of each key stage. The National Curriculum programmes of study provide minimum expectations, but ambitious curriculums go further, building toward GCSE-level proficiency or higher.

**Sequenced content:** Content logically ordered to build knowledge cumulatively. This includes sequencing of phonics, vocabulary, and grammar, as well as consideration of how receptive skills (listening, reading) support productive skills (speaking, writing).

**Cultural context:** Recognition that language learning is inseparable from cultural understanding. Intent should include how pupils will develop knowledge of the cultures where the target language is spoken.

#### Implementation

Implementation concerns how the intended curriculum is put into practice. Quality indicators include:

**Teaching quality:** Lessons that effectively convey new content, provide opportunities for practice, and check for understanding. Ofsted research suggests explicit instruction is particularly effective for novice learners, though this should be balanced with opportunities for communicative practice.

**Use of target language:** There is debate about the appropriate balance of target language use. Ofsted guidance suggests target language should be used where it supports learning and builds systematically on prior knowledge. It should not be used if it hinders comprehension—explaining grammar in the target language may confuse rather than clarify. The focus should be on pupils' use of target language, not just teachers'.

**Practice and consolidation:** Sufficient time allocated to practising new language in varied contexts. This includes structured practice of phonics, vocabulary, and grammar before expecting independent production.

**Assessment:** Regular, planned assessment that checks what has been taught and informs subsequent teaching. Assessment should evaluate phonics, vocabulary, and grammar separately as well as in integrated language use.

**Resources:** Appropriate resources including authentic and adapted texts that contain approximately 95% familiar vocabulary. Materials should be age-appropriate and aligned to curriculum sequencing.

#### Impact

Impact refers to the outcomes pupils achieve as a result of the curriculum. Evidence includes:

**Attainment:** What pupils know and can do in comparison to curriculum expectations. This includes assessment data but also qualitative evidence from lesson observations and work scrutiny.

**Progress:** Whether pupils are building knowledge cumulatively over time. Inspectors look for evidence that pupils remember previously taught content and can apply it in new contexts.

**Retention:** The proportion of pupils continuing with languages beyond the compulsory key stages. Low retention rates may indicate issues with curriculum design, teaching quality, or pupil motivation.

**Destinations:** For older pupils, progression to further study or employment using languages. High-quality MFL provision opens doors to international opportunities.

### Specific Quality Indicators for MFL

Beyond the generic three Is framework, Ofsted's research identifies specific quality indicators for MFL:

**Transition:** Quality of transition from Key Stage 2 to Key Stage 3 is a particular focus. Research indicates that many pupils experience languages as 'starting again' at secondary school, which is highly demotivating. Strong provision involves secondary schools building on primary foundations rather than assuming no prior knowledge.

**Phonics instruction:** Secure systems for teaching and assessing phonics from the earliest stages. This includes regular practice of sound-spelling relationships and attention to sounds that do not exist in English.

**Vocabulary selection:** Strategic selection of vocabulary based on frequency and utility rather than arbitrary topic lists. High-frequency vocabulary that can be used across multiple contexts should be prioritised.

**Grammar progression:** Logical sequencing of grammatical concepts with sufficient practice opportunities before introducing new structures.

**Assessment alignment:** Assessment that genuinely evaluates what has been taught rather than generic GCSE-style tasks. Formative assessment should inform teaching; summative assessment should evaluate curriculum impact.

**Professional development:** Access to language-specific CPD, particularly important given the challenges of recruiting and retaining MFL specialists. Most primary teachers have not accessed language-specific CPD in the previous year, representing a significant barrier to quality.

## The Deep Dive Framework

### Purpose and Structure

The deep dive is Ofsted's methodology for gathering rich evidence about the quality of education in specific subjects. During an inspection, inspectors typically conduct deep dives in three to six subjects, including reading and mathematics plus others selected based on the school's context. For MFL, being selected for a deep dive means inspectors will gather detailed evidence about curriculum intent, implementation, and impact.

The deep dive serves to "establish a coherent evidence base on quality of education." Rather than relying on isolated lesson observations, deep dives triangulate evidence from multiple sources to build a comprehensive picture of subject provision.

### Evidence Gathering Activities

An MFL deep dive typically involves several evidence-gathering activities:

**1. Leadership Discussion**

Inspectors meet with curriculum leaders to explore intent. Typical questions include:
- What is the rationale for your curriculum choices?
- How is content sequenced, and why?
- What are your end points for each key stage?
- How do you ensure progression?
- How do you address the three pillars of phonics, vocabulary, and grammar?
- What is the quality of transition from Key Stage 2 to Key Stage 3?

Leaders should be prepared to articulate their curriculum with precision, explaining not just what is taught but why. Generic responses about 'covering the National Curriculum' are insufficient; inspectors look for thoughtful, subject-specific rationale.

**2. Work Scrutiny**

Inspectors examine pupils' books or digital work to evaluate:
- Whether curriculum content is being taught in the sequence intended
- Whether pupils are practising phonics, vocabulary, and grammar regularly
- The quality of pupil work and whether it demonstrates progress
- Whether feedback is addressing specific language points

Work scrutiny is not about presentation or quantity but about evidence of learning and progress over time.

**3. Lesson Observations**

While individual lesson grades have been abolished, inspectors observe lessons to gather evidence about:
- How curriculum intent is being realised in classrooms
- Whether teaching methods are likely to deliver curriculum objectives
- How pupils are responding and engaging
- The quality of teacher subject knowledge

Observations are viewed in the context of the wider evidence base rather than judged in isolation.

**4. Pupil Discussions**

Inspectors talk to pupils about their learning, seeking to understand:
- What pupils know and remember from previous teaching
- Whether pupils can articulate what they are learning and why
- Pupils' attitudes toward language learning
- Whether pupils feel they are making progress

These discussions provide valuable triangulation of evidence from work scrutiny and observations.

**5. Curriculum Documentation Review**

Inspectors review curriculum documentation including:
- Long-term plans showing curriculum sequencing
- Schemes of work demonstrating how content builds over time
- Assessment policies and practices
- Evidence of how assessment informs curriculum adaptation

Documentation should be concise and purposeful rather than voluminous. Inspectors want to see that curriculum thinking has taken place, not that paperwork has been generated.

### Deep Dive Focus Areas

While each deep dive is tailored to the school's context, certain areas receive particular attention in MFL:

**Primary MFL provision:** Given the statutory requirement for Key Stage 2 languages, inspectors examine how primary schools are meeting this obligation. Challenges include sufficient curriculum time, teacher expertise, and quality of provision. Only 16% of primary schools carry out formal assessment of each child's language learning, representing a significant gap.

**Key Stage 3 continuation:** Inspectors note the high rate of disapplication from languages at Key Stage 3—only 68% of schools responding to the Language Trends survey reported that all Year 7 pupils access a language. This raises questions about curriculum breadth and the status of MFL.

**Curriculum time:** Sufficient time is essential for language learning to be effective. Inspectors note where curriculum time for MFL has been reduced or where rotations prevent sustained study.

**Teacher expertise:** The quality of teaching is fundamentally linked to teacher subject knowledge and proficiency. Inspectors consider how schools support non-specialist teachers and what CPD is available for specialists.

**GCSE preparation:** Where pupils are entered for GCSE, inspectors examine whether the curriculum builds toward this endpoint appropriately, balancing the three pillars with development of communicative competence.

### Preparing for Deep Dives: Practical Implications

Schools can prepare for potential MFL deep dives by ensuring:

**Clear curriculum narrative:** Leaders can articulate the curriculum story—what is taught, in what order, and why. This includes being able to explain decisions about language choice, content selection, and sequencing.

**Evidence of progression:** Documentation and pupil work demonstrate clear progression in phonics, vocabulary, and grammar. This might include phonics tracking, vocabulary lists showing cumulative development, and grammar progression maps.

**Assessment systems:** Assessment genuinely checks what has been taught and informs subsequent teaching. This includes regular low-stakes testing of phonics, vocabulary, and grammar alongside integrated skills assessment.

**Quality transition:** Where applicable, clear systems for transition from Key Stage 2 to Key Stage 3, including assessment of prior learning and curriculum building on primary foundations.

**Professional development:** Records of language-specific CPD and support for developing teacher expertise and proficiency.

**Pupil voice:** Systems for gathering and responding to pupil feedback about their language learning experience.

## Critiques and Controversies

### The Research Review Debate

Ofsted's languages research review has generated significant debate within the MFL community. Several critiques have been advanced:

**Narrow focus:** Some argue the emphasis on phonics, vocabulary, and grammar risks narrowing the curriculum, neglecting creativity, cultural understanding, and the joy of communication. The review explicitly addresses this concern, arguing that secure foundations in the three pillars actually enable rather than restrict these broader goals.

**Limited evidence base:** Critics note that some recommendations are based on limited research specific to foreign language education, drawing heavily on cognitive science and first language literacy research. The applicability of this research to MFL contexts has been questioned.

**Prescriptiveness:** Despite Ofsted's insistence that there is no 'Ofsted curriculum', some teachers report feeling pressured to adopt particular approaches—particularly explicit instruction and the three pillars structure—to satisfy inspectors.

**Primary challenges:** The review acknowledges the significant challenges facing primary MFL—limited time, lack of specialist teachers, poor CPD access—while arguably not fully addressing how these structural issues can be overcome.

### Deep Dive Methodology Concerns

The deep dive approach itself has generated discussion:

**Workload implications:** Preparing for deep dives can create significant workload, particularly where schools feel pressured to generate additional documentation to demonstrate curriculum thinking.

**Subject expertise:** The quality of deep dives depends on inspectors' subject expertise. While Ofsted has invested in subject-specific training, variability in inspector knowledge of MFL pedagogy remains a concern.

**Narrow focus:** Conducting deep dives in only three to six subjects means many subjects, potentially including MFL, may not be inspected in depth. This can lead to curriculum narrowing as schools focus on likely deep dive subjects.

**Primary challenges:** Deep dives into primary MFL are particularly challenging given the subject's variable provision. Inspectors need sensitivity to the context of non-specialist teaching.

## Conclusion

Ofsted's approach to MFL—through research reviews, quality indicators, and deep dive methodology—has significantly influenced curriculum thinking in recent years. The emphasis on phonics, vocabulary, and grammar as the three pillars of progression has shaped curriculum design, while the three Is framework provides a structure for evaluating provision.

For MFL leaders and teachers, understanding this framework is essential not merely for inspection preparation but for curriculum development. The research reviews contain valuable insights from language education research, even where practitioners may disagree with particular emphases. The deep dive methodology requires clarity about curriculum intent and the ability to articulate the rationale behind curriculum decisions.

The ultimate test of Ofsted's influence will be whether MFL outcomes improve—whether more pupils develop genuine proficiency, more continue with languages beyond compulsory study, and more recognize the value of language learning for their futures. The framework provides a structure; the profession must continue to develop the expertise and resources to deliver high-quality language education within it.
