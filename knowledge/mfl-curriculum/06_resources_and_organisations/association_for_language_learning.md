# Association for Language Learning (ALL)

## Overview

The **Association for Language Learning (ALL)** is the major professional subject association for language teachers in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1990 through the amalgamation of seven pre-existing language teacher associations, ALL now represents and supports language education professionals across all sectors—from early years and primary schools through to secondary, further education, higher education, and adult learning contexts. As a registered charity (number 1001826), ALL exists to promote and support the learning and teaching of natural languages and the development of languages education throughout the UK.

ALL occupies a unique position in the landscape of UK language education. Unlike subject associations focused on single languages, ALL embraces all languages and all levels of instruction, making it the most inclusive professional body for language educators in the country. Its membership spans teachers of modern foreign languages (MFL), community languages, classical languages, and English as an additional language (EAL), creating a diverse professional community united by a shared commitment to effective language pedagogy.

## Historical Development

### Formation and Early History (1990)

The Association for Language Learning was formally established in 1990, emerging from the consolidation of seven distinct UK associations of language teachers. This amalgamation represented a strategic response to the changing landscape of language education in the late 1980s, as the National Curriculum was being developed and the teaching of modern foreign languages was becoming increasingly formalised within the English education system.

The seven predecessor organisations that merged to form ALL brought together diverse communities of practice, each with its own history, publications, and areas of expertise. This amalgamation created a single, powerful voice for language teachers that could more effectively influence policy, represent the profession, and provide comprehensive support to practitioners across all contexts.

### Evolution Through Educational Reform

Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, ALL navigated significant changes in language education policy. The introduction of the National Curriculum for Modern Foreign Languages in 1991 established languages as a foundation subject at Key Stage 3, and ALL played a crucial role in supporting teachers through this transition. The association provided guidance on curriculum implementation, assessment, and the development of pedagogical approaches appropriate for the new statutory framework.

The decision in 2002 to allow students to drop languages at age 14 represented a significant challenge for the profession, and ALL actively campaigned against this policy change, arguing for the importance of language learning for all students. When the entitlement to language learning at Key Stage 2 was introduced in 2014, ALL again positioned itself at the forefront of supporting teachers through this major expansion of language education into primary schools.

### Contemporary Position

Today, ALL remains the largest and most comprehensive subject association for language teachers in the UK. It continues to adapt its services and priorities in response to changing educational contexts, including the challenges posed by declining language uptake at GCSE and A Level, the impact of Brexit on language learning motivations, and the increasing diversity of languages taught in UK schools beyond the traditional focus on French, German, and Spanish.

## Organisational Structure

### Governance and Management

ALL operates as a membership organisation governed by a Management Board responsible for strategic direction and oversight. The board comprises elected members who represent the diverse sectors and languages within ALL's membership, ensuring that decision-making reflects the needs and perspectives of the full professional community.

The association is supported by a small staff team based at its headquarters, which coordinates publications, events, and member services. However, much of ALL's activity is delivered through volunteer networks, reflecting the association's commitment to practitioner-led professional development and peer support.

### Membership Categories

ALL offers several membership categories designed to meet the needs of different practitioners:

**Individual Membership** is available to language teachers, teacher educators, and other professionals involved in language education. Individual members receive full access to ALL's publications, events, and resources, as well as voting rights in association elections.

**Student Membership** provides reduced-rate access for trainee teachers and students, supporting the development of the next generation of language educators.

**Institutional Membership** allows schools, colleges, and universities to join ALL as organisations, providing access for multiple staff members and supporting whole-department professional development.

**Corporate Membership** is available to organisations offering products or services to language educators, including publishers, technology providers, and examination boards. Corporate members support ALL's work while gaining access to the association's network of language teaching professionals.

### Local and Regional Networks

A defining feature of ALL's structure is its extensive network of local groups that deliver grassroots professional development and networking opportunities. These groups operate at different levels:

**Branches** are formal local groups with established committees and regular programmes of activity. They typically organise termly meetings, workshops, and networking events for members in their geographic area.

**Networks** operate more informally, often in areas where the nearest branch is geographically distant. Networks provide lighter-touch opportunities for teachers to connect and share practice without the formal structure of a branch.

**Primary Hubs** are specifically designed to support teachers involved in developing primary language teaching. These hubs recognise the unique challenges and opportunities of primary MFL and provide targeted support for non-specialist teachers who may be delivering language lessons as part of a broader primary curriculum.

**Language Networks** represent the major languages taught by ALL members, providing subject-specific communities of practice for teachers of particular languages. These networks enable language-specific pedagogical discussions and resource sharing.

**Special Interest Groups (SIGs)** bring together members with shared professional interests or working in particular contexts, such as early years languages, community languages, or languages for specific purposes.

## The Language Learning Journal

### Overview and Scope

The **Language Learning Journal (LLJ)** is the official academic journal of the Association for Language Learning, published by Taylor & Francis. As a peer-reviewed academic journal, the LLJ provides a forum for research and scholarly debate on all aspects of foreign and second language learning and teaching. The journal bridges the gap between research and practice, publishing work that is relevant and accessible to both academic researchers and classroom practitioners.

The LLJ covers a broad range of topics within language education, including:

- Second and foreign language pedagogy
- Language teacher education and professional development
- Curriculum development and syllabus design
- Assessment and evaluation in language learning
- Learner autonomy and independent learning
- Technology-enhanced language learning
- Intercultural competence and language education
- Bilingual and multilingual education
- Policy and planning in language education

### Peer Review and Editorial Standards

All research articles published in the Language Learning Journal undergo rigorous peer review, based on initial editor screening followed by anonymised refereeing by at least two anonymous referees. This process ensures that published work meets high standards of academic rigour while remaining accessible to the broader language teaching community.

The journal maintains a balance between theoretical research and practical applications, recognising that its readership includes both academic researchers and classroom teachers seeking evidence-based approaches to inform their practice. Articles typically include clear implications for pedagogy, ensuring that research findings can be translated into classroom practice.

### Contribution to the Field

The LLJ has established itself as a leading international journal in the field of language education. Its affiliation with ALL ensures that it maintains strong connections to classroom practice, while its partnership with Taylor & Francis provides the infrastructure and reach of a major academic publisher. The journal's commitment to practitioner relevance distinguishes it from more theoretically focused publications, making it a valuable resource for teachers seeking to engage with current research.

For ALL members, access to the Language Learning Journal represents a significant membership benefit, providing ongoing professional reading that supports reflective practice and continuous development. The journal also provides opportunities for members to disseminate their own research and practice, contributing to the collective knowledge base of the profession.

## Language World Conference

### Overview and Significance

**Language World** is the annual conference and professional learning event of the Association for Language Learning. Held over two days, typically in March or April, Language World has become a highlight of the professional calendar for language teachers across the UK.

**Media Representation**, ensuring that language teaching perspectives are included in public debates about education.

**Partnership Working** with other organisations to promote the value of language learning and address shared concerns.

**Campaigns** on specific issues, such as the association's ongoing work to reverse the decline in language examination entries and promote the importance of languages for all learners.

## Pedagogical Contributions and Influence

### Curriculum Development Support

ALL has played a significant role in supporting teachers through major curriculum changes. When the National Curriculum for Modern Foreign Languages was introduced in 1991, ALL provided guidance materials and training that helped teachers understand and implement the new requirements. Similarly, the association has supported the expansion of primary language teaching since 2014, producing resources and training specifically designed for non-specialist primary teachers.

The association's approach to curriculum support emphasises pedagogical principles over prescription, recognising that effective teaching requires professional judgment adapted to specific contexts. ALL's guidance materials typically present frameworks and approaches that teachers can adapt to their own circumstances, rather than rigid schemes of work.

### Assessment and Examination

ALL maintains active engagement with developments in language assessment, including the design of national examinations and the development of assessment approaches for classroom use. The association represents teacher perspectives to examination boards and policy makers, advocating for assessments that are valid, reliable, and supportive of effective teaching.

The association has also produced guidance on assessment for learning in languages, supporting teachers to develop classroom assessment practices that promote learner progress and engagement.

### Research-Practice Links

Through its publications, events, and advocacy, ALL has consistently promoted the importance of research-informed practice in language teaching. The association's unique position—encompassing both the academic Language Learning Journal and extensive practitioner networks—enables it to facilitate dialogue between researchers and teachers, helping to ensure that research findings reach classrooms and that practitioner perspectives inform research agendas.

## Current Challenges and Future Directions

### Responding to Declining Uptake

One of the most significant challenges facing ALL and the wider language teaching community is the long-term decline in language examination entries at GCSE and A Level since 2004. ALL has been at the forefront of efforts to understand and address this decline, commissioning research, advocating for policy changes, and supporting teachers to make language learning more engaging and successful for all students.

The association's response to this challenge has included emphasising the importance of primary language teaching as a foundation for continued study, promoting innovative pedagogical approaches that increase learner motivation, and arguing for the structural changes needed to make language learning an attractive option for all students.

### Supporting Diversity and Inclusion

ALL has increasingly focused on supporting the teaching of diverse languages beyond the traditional trio of French, German, and Spanish. The association's inclusive ethos embraces community languages, lesser-taught languages, and classical languages, recognising the value of all language learning for individuals and society.

This commitment to diversity extends to supporting teachers working in multilingual classrooms and developing inclusive pedagogies that recognise and value learners' diverse linguistic backgrounds.

### Technology and Innovation

The integration of technology in language teaching has been a consistent theme in ALL's work, with the association supporting teachers to evaluate and implement digital tools effectively. As technology continues to evolve rapidly, ALL faces the challenge of providing timely, evidence-based guidance on new developments while maintaining focus on the enduring principles of effective language pedagogy.

### Brexit and International Engagement

The UK's departure from the European Union has created both challenges and opportunities for language education. ALL has worked to maintain and develop international partnerships and to advocate for the continued importance of language skills in a post-Brexit context. The association has also supported teachers to develop global citizenship perspectives that extend beyond European contexts.

## Conclusion

The Association for Language Learning occupies a vital position in the landscape of UK language education. As the major subject association for language teachers, ALL provides comprehensive support for professional development, represents the profession to policy makers, and facilitates the exchange of ideas and resources that drive improvement in practice.

Through its diverse activities—from the academic rigour of the Language Learning Journal to the grassroots networking of local branches, from the inspirational gathering of Language World to the practical guidance of publications and resources—ALL serves the full range of language teaching professionals. The association's commitment to all languages, all levels, and all sectors makes it uniquely positioned to support the development of language education in all its diversity.

As language education faces ongoing challenges from policy changes, declining uptake, and shifting social attitudes, the role of a strong professional association becomes ever more important. ALL's continued work to support
