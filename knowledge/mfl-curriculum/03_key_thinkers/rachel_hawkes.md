# Rachel Hawkes: Target Language Pedagogy, Curriculum Design and Engagement

## Biography and Professional Background

Rachel Hawkes stands as one of the most influential figures in Modern Foreign Languages (MFL) education in England over the past two decades. She currently serves as **Director of International Education and Research** for The Cam Academy Trust, a multi-academy trust comprising 11 schools, where she also works as a Specialist Leader of Education (SLE) for languages. Her influence extends nationally through her role as **Co-Director of NCELP** (National Centre for Excellence in Language Pedagogy) from 2018 to 2023, England's first MFL Centre for Excellence.

Hawkes's academic credentials are substantial. She holds both an MEd and a **PhD from the University of Cambridge**, completed in 2012. Her doctoral thesis, titled "Learning to talk and talking to learn: how spontaneous teacher-learner interaction in the secondary foreign languages classroom provides greater opportunities for L2 learning," represents a significant contribution to understanding classroom discourse in language education. This research established the theoretical foundations that would later inform her practical approaches to curriculum design and pedagogy.

Beyond her trust and research roles, Hawkes has served as **President of the Association for Language Learning (ALL)**, the UK's largest subject association for language teachers. She is also a published author of several languages textbooks and serves as Languages Advisor for TES Resources. Her work has been recognised through her appointment to develop curriculum resources for the **Oak National Academy**, where her primary and secondary languages curricula are described as "culture-rich, research-led and practice-informed."

## Theoretical Foundations: Socio-Cultural Theory and Dialogic Teaching

### Vygotskian Foundations

Hawkes's pedagogical approach is grounded in **sociocultural theory (SCT)**, drawing particularly on Vygotsky's work on the relationship between language and cognitive development. This theoretical framework posits that learning occurs through social interaction and that language serves as the primary tool for cognitive development. For Hawkes, this means that the quality of classroom interaction directly influences the depth of language learning that occurs.

Her research takes sociocultural theory as its main point of departure, specifically drawing on the tenets of an **SCT-based dialogic teaching approach**. This perspective views the classroom not as a space for transmission of knowledge from teacher to learner, but as a collaborative environment where meaning is constructed through interaction. The teacher's role shifts from instructor to facilitator of learning conversations.

### Dialogic Teaching in Practice

Hawkes's work addresses a critical concern in MFL classrooms: the dominant **IRE/F pattern** (Initiation-Response-Evaluation/Follow-up) of classroom discourse. Research consistently shows that this traditional pattern, where the teacher asks a question, a student responds, and the teacher evaluates, does not provide learners with sufficient interactive space to develop their oral output optimally.

Her intervention programme was designed to **subvert this dominant pattern** through specific teacher talk and behaviour strategies. The goal is to promote higher levels of learner L2 output by creating more dialogic classroom spaces where students engage in extended discourse rather than minimal responses.

## The Three Language Knowledge Strands

### Phonics: The Foundation of Pronunciation

Hawkes was a **pioneer in teaching phonics** in MFL, beginning this work in the early 2000s when phonics instruction was primarily associated with English literacy rather than foreign language learning. Her approach recognises that explicit phonics instruction enables learners to decode unfamiliar words independently, building confidence and autonomy in pronunciation.

The phonics strand in Hawkes's curriculum design emphasises:

- **Systematic introduction** of sound-symbol correspondences
- **Regular practice** with phonics embedded across all units
- **Application to new vocabulary**, enabling learners to tackle unfamiliar words
- **Connection to spelling patterns**, supporting both receptive and productive skills

Schools adopting her schemes report that beginning each year with a phonics focus establishes foundational knowledge that supports subsequent vocabulary acquisition. The phonics work is not treated as a separate component but as an integral part of all language learning activities.

### Vocabulary: Building the Lexical Foundation

Vocabulary acquisition in Hawkes's framework is carefully structured and deliberately sequenced. Her approach recognises that **vocabulary knowledge underpins all communicative competence** and that learners need both breadth (quantity of words known) and depth (rich understanding of how words function).

Key principles of her vocabulary pedagogy include:

- **Careful introduction** of new vocabulary in meaningful contexts
- **Regular revisiting** and recycling of vocabulary across lessons and units
- **Building progressively**, with each year's curriculum extending and consolidating previous learning
- **Connection to phonics**, so learners can pronounce new words correctly
- **Integration with grammar**, showing how vocabulary functions within structures

The vocabulary strand is not treated as isolated word lists but as living language that learners encounter, practise, and apply in increasingly complex ways. This approach aligns with research on spaced repetition and the importance of encountering vocabulary in multiple contexts for durable learning.

### Grammar: Structuring Communication

Grammar instruction in Hawkes's curriculum is **explicit and systematic** rather than incidental. She argues that learners need conscious understanding of how the language works to develop genuine communicative competence. However, her approach avoids the traditional grammar-translation method, instead integrating grammar instruction with meaningful communication.

The grammar strand focuses on:

- **Core structures** that enable genuine communication
- **Progressive development** from simple to complex constructions
- **Explicit teaching** of rules and patterns
- **Immediate application** in communicative activities
- **Integration** with vocabulary and phonics to create complete utterances

This approach reflects the **MFL Pedagogy Review (2016)** recommendations, with which Hawkes's work is explicitly aligned. Grammar is taught as a tool for communication rather than as an abstract system to be memorised.

## Spontaneous Talk and Classroom Interaction

### The Challenge of Speaking

Hawkes's doctoral research focused specifically on **spontaneous talk** in the languages classroom—a persistent challenge in MFL education. While teachers and inspectors consistently identify speaking as a priority, research shows that many learners leave school unable to hold even basic conversations in the target language despite years of study.

Her research identified that the quality of **teacher-learner interaction** is crucial in developing spontaneous speaking capabilities. Traditional classroom patterns often limit students to short, rehearsed responses rather than genuine communication. Hawkes argues that learners need opportunities for extended, unscripted interaction to develop genuine fluency.

### Strategies for Promoting L2 Output

Based on her research, Hawkes developed specific **teacher talk strategies** to promote higher levels of learner L2 output:

**Open Questioning**: Moving beyond closed questions that require single-word answers to open questions that demand extended responses. Instead of "Do you like football?" (yes/no), teachers might ask "What do you think about football?" requiring opinion and explanation.

**Extensions of Exchanges**: Rather than the typical IRE pattern, teachers extend exchanges through follow-up questions, requests for clarification, and invitations to elaborate. This creates dialogic spaces where students engage in genuine conversation rather than scripted responses.

**Subverting Traditional Patterns**: Hawkes's intervention programme specifically targets the disruption of traditional classroom discourse patterns. This includes strategic silence (waiting for extended responses), echoing (repeating student contributions to value them), and redirecting (inviting other students to respond to peers).

**Fun and Engagement**: Hawkes emphasises the importance of creating reasons for students to talk. Her F-A-S framework (Fun, Achievement, Social) provides a structure for designing speaking activities that motivate genuine communication.

### The F-A-S Framework

Hawkes's **F-A-S framework** for promoting spontaneous talk emphasises three key dimensions:

**Fun**: Creating activities that students actually want to engage with. This includes noting and responding to what students want or need to say, exploiting and invoking humour, designing open-ended tasks, and subverting classroom norms to create unexpected and engaging scenarios.

**Achievement**: Ensuring that speaking activities provide appropriate challenge while remaining achievable. This involves careful scaffolding, clear success criteria, and progressive development of complexity.

**Social**: Recognising that language is inherently social and that speaking activities should leverage social motivation. This includes pair and group work, information-gap activities, and tasks that require genuine communication to complete.

## Curriculum Design Principles

### Language-Led, Knowledge-Rich, Practice-Based

Hawkes's approach to curriculum design is characterised by three interrelated principles:

**Language-Led**: The curriculum is organised around language development rather than thematic topics. While topics provide context, the progression is driven by the systematic development of linguistic knowledge and skills.

**Knowledge-Rich**: The curriculum is explicitly designed to build substantial linguistic knowledge across the three strands (phonics, vocabulary, grammar). This knowledge is specified, taught directly, and regularly assessed.

**Practice-Based**: Knowledge is developed through extensive practice in meaningful contexts. The curriculum provides numerous opportunities for learners to use language communicatively, with the goal of developing automaticity through repeated practice.

### Cultural Integration

While language knowledge provides the structural foundation, Hawkes's curricula are also **culture-rich**. Cultural content gives units their contexts and provides authentic reasons for communication. This cultural dimension is not treated as an add-on but as integral to meaningful language use.

The cultural content in her curricula:

- Provides **authentic contexts** for language use
- Develops **intercultural understanding**
- Reflects the **diversity** of target language communities
- Connects to **learners' interests** and experiences

This approach aligns with the **Ofsted languages research review**, which emphasises the importance of cultural understanding alongside linguistic competence.

### Sequenced Progression

Hawkes's curriculum design emphasises **finely sequenced progression** across key stages. Each unit builds deliberately on previous learning, with clear specification of what knowledge and skills are being developed. This sequencing applies across all three language knowledge strands:

- **Phonics progression** from basic sound-symbol correspondences to complex pronunciation patterns
- **Vocabulary progression** from high-frequency concrete words to abstract and specialised terms
- **Grammar progression** from simple sentences to complex structures and discourse patterns

This careful sequencing ensures that learners develop cumulative knowledge that enables increasingly sophisticated communication.

## The Language-Driven Pedagogy (LDP) Programme

### Partnership with University of York

The **Language-Driven Pedagogy (LDP)** programme represents Hawkes's most significant curriculum development initiative. Developed through a partnership between the University of York and The Cam Academy Trust, this programme brings together academic research and teaching practice to create resources informed by evidence.

The LDP programme was developed in response to several key policy developments:

- The **MFL Pedagogy Review (2016)** recommendations
- The **new subject content for GCSE French, German and Spanish**
- The **Ofsted languages research review**

This alignment ensures that the resources are not only theoretically sound but also practically relevant to current curriculum and assessment requirements.

### CPD and Resource Development

The LDP programme includes a **comprehensive programme of CPD** designed to support teachers in implementing the curriculum approach. This professional development:

- Explores the theoretical foundations of language-driven pedagogy
- Provides practical strategies for classroom implementation
- Offers examples of schemes of work and resources
- Supports teachers in adapting materials for their specific contexts

## Practical Applications for Teachers

### Implementing the Three Strands

Teachers seeking to apply Hawkes's approach in their classrooms should consider:

**Phonics Integration**: Begin each year, term, or unit with explicit phonics instruction. Ensure that phonics is revisited regularly and applied to new vocabulary. Use visual supports (colour-coded backgrounds for gender, for example) to reinforce phonics learning.

**Vocabulary Curriculum**: Develop a specified vocabulary curriculum with clear progression. Ensure regular revisiting of vocabulary across lessons and units. Connect vocabulary teaching to phonics and grammar to show how words function within the language system.

**Explicit Grammar**: Teach grammar explicitly but integrate it immediately with communicative activities. Avoid teaching grammar in isolation; instead, show learners how grammatical structures enable them to communicate more effectively.

### Promoting Spontaneous Talk

To develop spontaneous speaking capabilities:

- **Design activities that create genuine need for communication** (information-gap tasks, communicative games)
- **Use open questions** that require extended responses
- **Extend exchanges** beyond the IRE pattern through follow-up questions and invitations to elaborate
- **Create engaging contexts** that motivate students to communicate
- **Provide appropriate scaffolding** while gradually removing support to develop independence

### Curriculum Planning

When planning curriculum:

- **Specify the knowledge** to be developed (phonics, vocabulary, grammar)
- **Sequence learning deliberately** with clear progression
- **Integrate cultural content** authentically
- **Provide extensive practice opportunities**
- **Assess knowledge explicitly** to ensure learning has occurred

## Critical Perspectives and Debates

### Target Language Use

Hawkes's work sits within broader debates about **target language (TL) use** in the classroom. While she advocates for substantial TL use, her research also recognises the importance of comprehensibility. She tells the illustrative story of a student who developed the misconception that "everything had to be done in ten days" due to mishearing the French word "tend" (hold/stretch).

This story illustrates her nuanced position: maximum TL use is desirable, but it must be **comprehensible TL use**. Teachers need strategies to ensure that target language communication is genuinely understood, including visual supports, gesture, context, and occasional strategic use of English.

### Response to Critiques

Hawkes's work on spontaneous talk has generated productive debate within the MFL community. Some practitioners, while respecting her contributions, have questioned whether certain approaches to teaching spontaneous talk may overemphasise output at the expense of comprehensible input. These debates reflect the broader field's ongoing negotiation of the balance between input and output in language acquisition.

Hawkes's response to such critiques would likely emphasise that her approach is not about output instead of input, but about ensuring that the input learners receive is actively processed through meaningful interaction. The dialogic teaching strategies she advocates create conditions for comprehensible input to be engaged with deeply.

## Impact and Legacy

### National Influence

Hawkes's influence on MFL education in England extends through multiple channels:

- **NCELP**: As Co-Director, she shaped the work of England's first MFL Centre for Excellence, influencing policy and practice nationally
- **Oak National Academy**: Her curriculum resources are used by schools across the country
- **CPD Programmes**: Her professional development programmes have reached thousands of teachers
- **Textbook Authorship**: Her published materials are used in classrooms nationwide
- **Academic Research**: Her doctoral research contributes to the evidence base for language pedagogy

### Research-Practice Bridge

Perhaps Hawkes's most significant contribution is her demonstration that **rigorous academic research can inform practical classroom teaching**. Her work shows how sociocultural theory can be translated into specific teaching strategies, how doctoral research can address genuine classroom challenges, and how university-school partnerships can generate resources that are both theoretically sound and practically useful.

This bridging role is increasingly important in an educational landscape where teachers are often caught between competing demands: the pressure to be research-informed while also managing the daily realities of classroom teaching. Hawkes's work shows that these demands need not be in tension—that research can illuminate practice and practice can inform research.

### Future Directions

Hawkes's ongoing work, including her CPD sessions for 2025-2026, continues to develop her approach in response to changing contexts. The challenges facing MFL education in England—including declining uptake at GCSE and A Level, teacher recruitment difficulties, and the changing status of European languages post-Brexit—require continued innovation in curriculum design and pedagogy.

Her framework of language-led, knowledge-rich, practice-based curriculum provides a robust foundation for addressing these challenges. By ensuring that learners develop genuine linguistic competence through systematic instruction and extensive practice, Hawkes's approach offers a pathway to rebuilding confidence in language education.

## Key Takeaways for Practitioners

1. **The three language knowledge strands** (phonics, vocabulary, grammar) provide the foundation for all communicative competence and should be explicitly taught and systematically developed.

2. **Quality of classroom interaction** matters as much as quantity of target language use. Teachers should employ dialogic teaching strategies to promote extended learner output.

3. **Curriculum design** should be language-led and knowledge-rich, with careful sequencing of content across key stages.

4. **Spontaneous talk** develops through structured opportunities for meaningful communication, not through unfocused conversation practice.

5. **Research and practice** can and should inform each other. Teachers can engage with research evidence to develop their practice, and researchers can address questions of genuine classroom relevance.
