# Ernesto Macaro: Language Learning Strategies and Code-Switching

## Biography and Academic Background

Ernesto Macaro is Emeritus Professor of Applied Linguistics in the Department of Education at the University of Oxford, where he also served as founding director of the EMI Oxford Research Group (formerly the Centre for Research and Development in English Medium Instruction). His career trajectory reflects a deep commitment to understanding the practical realities of language classrooms: having become a second language learner at the age of eight and a foreign language learner at thirteen, Macaro built upon this personal experience through many years of teaching in secondary schools in England before transitioning to academic research and lecturing in Modern Languages Education at the University of Reading.

This dual identity as both practitioner and researcher has profoundly shaped Macaro's contribution to the field. Unlike theorists whose work remains at a distance from classroom realities, Macaro's research is grounded in the observable complexities of teaching and learning. His position at Oxford represents the culmination of a career dedicated to bridging the gap between second language research and pedagogical practice, with particular attention to the interaction between teachers and learners in second language classrooms and in classrooms where English is the medium of instruction (EMI).

## The Target Language Debate: Beyond Binary Thinking

### Macaro's Foundational Contribution

Macaro's most influential early work, *Target Language, Collaborative Learning and Autonomy* (1997), emerged at a critical moment in UK language education. The National Curriculum had imposed expectations about target language use without adequately addressing the methodological implications or teacher preparedness. Macaro's response was not simply to advocate for or against exclusive target language use, but to subject the concept itself to rigorous empirical investigation.

His research revealed a significant divergence between official policy and classroom reality. Macaro's investigation of secondary school learners' opinions about their teachers' English-only practices exposed a fundamental tension: while a small 'able' group of learners did not mind the 'use only English' attitude, a majority wanted their teachers to use some English to support their understanding. This finding challenged the assumption that maximum target language exposure necessarily equated to optimal learning.

### The Problem with 'Maximisation'

Macaro identified what he termed the "maximisation argument"—the belief that the more target language pupils hear, the more they learn. While intuitively appealing, this argument fails to account for:

- **Comprehensibility**: Input that exceeds learners' processing capacity becomes noise rather than learning material
- **Learner anxiety**: Excessive target language use can create affective barriers that inhibit acquisition
- **Strategic behaviour**: Learners develop coping mechanisms (some productive, others counterproductive) when faced with exclusive target language instruction
- **Quality of interaction**: The nature of teacher-learner exchange matters more than the quantity of target language used

Macaro's work demonstrated that blanket policies mandating target language use without attention to these variables are pedagogically unsound. His research provided teachers with evidence-based justification for principled code-switching rather than dogmatic adherence to target language exclusivity.

## Code-Switching as Communication and Learning Strategy

### Reframing Code-Switching

Macaro's 2005 chapter "Codeswitching in the L2 Classroom: A Communication and Learning Strategy" (published in *Non-Native Language Teachers*, edited by Enric Llurda) represents a pivotal reframing of how educators should understand language alternation in the classroom. Rather than viewing code-switching as a failure of methodology or evidence of teacher deficiency, Macaro positioned it as a rational, strategic response to the complex communicative demands of the language classroom.

His analysis distinguished between:

- **Inter-sentential code-switching**: Switching between complete sentences in different languages
- **Intra-sentential code-switching**: Embedding words or phrases from one language within sentences of another

Macaro observed that much of effective 'teacher speak' in the classroom is formed using intra-sentential code-switching, where a key word or phrase is switched to support comprehension. This might involve using high-frequency words from the learner's first language strategically placed within target language discourse.

### Strategic Functions of Code-Switching

Macaro's empirical work identified multiple legitimate functions of code-switching in the language classroom:

**Metalinguistic Function**: Teachers switch languages to draw explicit attention to linguistic features, to explain grammar points, or to make comparisons between the target language and the learners' first language. This function serves a direct pedagogical purpose that cannot be adequately fulfilled through target language alone.

**Classroom Management Function**: Instructions about behaviour, task procedures, and organisational matters may be more efficiently and effectively communicated in the shared language. The time saved and confusion avoided can be redirected toward meaningful target language use during actual learning activities.

**Affective Function**: Code-switching can reduce learner anxiety, build rapport, and create a supportive classroom climate. When learners feel overwhelmed by exclusive target language use, strategic switching can restore confidence and maintain engagement.

**Cognitive Scaffolding Function**: For complex cognitive tasks, temporary retreat to the first language can enable learners to process information, formulate ideas, and prepare for subsequent target language production. This represents a temporary support that is gradually withdrawn as proficiency develops.

### The Risk of Excessive Code-Switching

Macaro's balanced perspective acknowledges that code-switching is not without risks. His research (2001) warned that excessive code-switching may limit immersion and target language exposure, potentially hindering proficiency development. The key is strategic, principled use rather than habitual, unexamined alternation between languages.

Macaro's framework therefore does not legitimate random or excessive switching but provides criteria for evaluating when code-switching serves learning purposes and when it undermines them. Teachers are encouraged to make conscious, pedagogically informed decisions rather than defaulting to English through habit or anxiety.

## Language Learner Strategies: A Comprehensive Framework

### From Taxonomies to Strategic Behaviour

Macaro's contribution to learner strategy research extends beyond cataloguing techniques to understanding the cognitive and metacognitive processes underlying strategic behaviour. His 2006 article "Strategies for Language Learning and for Language Use: Revising the Theoretical Framework" (published in *The Modern Language Journal*) offered a sophisticated reconceptualisation of how strategies function.

Rather than treating strategies as discrete behaviours that can be simply trained, Macaro emphasised:

- The relationship between learner characteristics and strategy selection
- The importance of context in determining strategy effectiveness
- The dynamic nature of strategy deployment during tasks
- The distinction between strategies for learning and strategies for language use

### The Intersection of Strategies and Learner Autonomy

A consistent theme in Macaro's work is the connection between learner strategies and learner autonomy. His early work on collaborative learning and autonomy established that effective strategy use is a prerequisite for autonomous learning. Learners who cannot access and deploy appropriate strategies remain dependent on teacher scaffolding and cannot progress toward self-directed learning.

Macaro's framework identifies several domains of strategic competence:

**Cognitive Strategies**: Techniques for processing and manipulating language material, including rehearsal, organisation, and elaboration strategies.

**Metacognitive Strategies**: Higher-order processes for planning, monitoring, and evaluating learning. Macaro's research demonstrated that metacognitive awareness is a key differentiator between more and less successful language learners.

**Social and Affective Strategies**: Approaches for managing the social and emotional dimensions of language learning, including cooperation with others and anxiety management.

**Communication Strategies**: Techniques for maintaining communication when linguistic resources are insufficient, including paraphrase, approximation, and code-switching itself.

### Thirty Years of Research and Practice

Macaro's 2007 edited volume *Language Learner Strategies: Thirty Years of Research and Practice* (co-edited with Andrew D. Cohen and published in Oxford Applied Linguistics) represents a comprehensive stocktaking of the field. The contributions examine how language learner strategies intersect with the evolving landscape of language education, including the impact of technological advancements on autonomous learning.

This volume established Macaro's position as a leading authority on learner strategies while also demonstrating his commitment to making research accessible to practitioners. The collection addressed questions of immediate classroom relevance: Can strategies be taught? Does strategy instruction improve outcomes? How do strategies vary across different learning contexts and learner populations?

## Intervention Research and Strategy Instruction

### Evidence for Strategy Instruction

Macaro's *Learning Strategies in Foreign and Second Language Classrooms: The Role of Learner Strategies* (2001) reported detailed intervention studies examining whether learners can be trained to use strategies more effectively. This work moved beyond descriptive research to test the pedagogical hypothesis that strategy instruction enhances learning outcomes.

The book's contents reflect Macaro's comprehensive approach:

1. The relationship between learner strategies and teacher strategies
2. Methodologies for investigating learners in classrooms
3. Studies describing strategy use in naturalistic settings
4. Intervention studies and "learning to learn" programmes
5. Detailed case studies of intervention
6. Learner training in language classrooms
7. Follow-up studies tracking the long-term impact of strategy instruction

Macaro's findings supported the conclusion that strategy instruction can be effective, but with important caveats. Strategy training must be integrated with language content rather than taught as decontextualised skills. Teachers need professional development to deliver strategy instruction effectively. And the relationship between strategy use and proficiency is complex—more strategy use does not automatically equate to better outcomes if the strategies are poorly chosen or inappropriately deployed.

## English Medium Instruction and Beyond

### Extending the Framework

In recent years, Macaro has applied his insights about target language use, code-switching, and classroom interaction to the rapidly expanding field of English Medium Instruction (EMI). His definition of EMI as "the use of the English language to teach academic subjects (other than English itself) in countries or jurisdictions where the first language of the majority of the population is not English" has become widely adopted.

Macaro's research on EMI, including his 2020 article with colleagues on first and second language use in EMI contexts, applies his earlier insights about code-switching to higher education settings. The same principles—strategic rather than habitual alternation between languages, attention to learner processing capacity, the legitimacy of L1 use for certain functions—prove equally relevant in university classrooms where English is the medium of instruction.

This body of work includes a significant interview published in 2021 in *RELC Journal*, where Macaro discussed the implications of EMI research for language education policy and practice. His insights about the interaction between teachers and learners in second language classrooms have informed debates about EMI quality assurance, teacher preparation, and student support.

## Pedagogical Implications for UK Classrooms

### For Secondary MFL Teachers

Macaro's research offers several direct applications for UK secondary modern foreign language classrooms:

**Principled Target Language Use**: Teachers should aim for high target language use while recognising that 100% target language is neither achievable nor necessarily desirable. The goal is strategic use of English to support learning, not its elimination.

**Code-Switching Awareness**: Teachers should monitor their own code-switching patterns to distinguish between strategic, pedagogically justified alternation and habitual retreat to English. This awareness enables more deliberate practice.

**Strategy Instruction Integration**: Rather than treating learner strategies as an add-on, teachers should embed strategy awareness into regular language instruction. This includes making strategies explicit, modelling their use, and providing opportunities for practice and reflection.

**Learner Voice**: Macaro's research demonstrates the value of attending to learner perspectives. Teachers should create opportunities for pupils to express preferences and difficulties, using this feedback to inform decisions about target language use.

### For Primary MFL

Macaro's insights are equally relevant for primary settings, where the cognitive and affective demands of language learning must be carefully calibrated to young learners' developmental levels:

**Scaffolded Target Language Exposure**: Primary teachers should provide rich but comprehensible target language input, using gesture, visual support, and strategic code-switching to maintain understanding.

**Metacognitive Foundations**: Even young learners can begin developing awareness of how they learn. Simple strategy instruction ("What do you do when you don't know a word?") builds foundations for later autonomy.

### For Teacher Education

Macaro's work should inform initial teacher education and continuing professional development:

**Evidence-Based Target Language Policies**: Trainee teachers need access to research evidence about target language use rather than simplistic 'rules' that ignore classroom complexity.

**Code-Switching as Skill**: Rather than presenting code-switching as a failure, teacher educators should help trainees develop skill in strategic language alternation.

**Strategy Instruction Methods**: Teachers need practical training in how to integrate strategy instruction into their language teaching.

## Critiques and Limitations

### Contextual Specificity

While Macaro's research was conducted primarily in UK secondary school contexts, practitioners should consider how findings might transfer to different settings. The specific dynamics of code-switching may vary across languages with different linguistic distance from English, and across educational cultures with different attitudes toward target language use.

### Individual Differences

Macaro's work acknowledges significant individual variation in learner responses to target language use and in strategy preferences. Teachers must balance general principles from research with attention to the specific learners in their classrooms.

### Changing Landscape

The language education context has evolved since much of Macaro's foundational research. Increased linguistic diversity in UK classrooms, technological developments affecting language exposure, and shifting policy priorities all require ongoing application and testing of Macaro's insights.

## Conclusion

Ernesto Macaro has made a distinctive and lasting contribution to modern foreign language education through his research on code-switching, learner strategies, and target language use. His work stands out for its empirical rigour, its grounding in classroom realities, and its practical relevance for teachers.

Macaro's key legacy is the shift from dogmatic prescriptions about target language use to evidence-based, strategic thinking about classroom language choices. Rather than simply telling teachers to maximise target language use, he provided frameworks for understanding when and why code-switching occurs, how it can serve learning purposes, and how to develop learners' strategic competence.

For UK language teachers, Macaro offers permission to be realistic and strategic rather than dogmatic. His research validates the complexity teachers experience while providing tools for navigating that complexity more effectively. In a field often characterised by pendulum swings between methodological extremes, Macaro's nuanced, evidence-based approach provides a model for principled professional practice.
