# Michael Byram: Intercultural Communicative Competence and the Council of Europe

## Biographical Overview

Michael Byram is one of the most influential scholars in modern foreign language education, whose work on intercultural communicative competence has fundamentally shaped how languages are taught across Europe and beyond. Born in 1945, Byram studied Modern and Medieval Languages at the University of Cambridge before embarking on a career that would bridge the worlds of school teaching, teacher education, and international language policy.

Byram's early career involved teaching French and German in secondary schools and adult education, grounding his theoretical work in practical classroom experience. He subsequently moved into teacher education at the University of Durham, where he became Professor of Education and eventually Emeritus Professor. His position at Durham established him as a leading figure in UK language education while providing a platform for his international influence.

From the 1990s until recently, Byram served as **Adviser to the Language Policy Division of the Council of Europe** and as a member of expert groups developing the organisation's language education policy. This role placed him at the centre of European efforts to promote plurilingualism, intercultural understanding, and democratic citizenship through language education. His work with the Council of Europe directly influenced the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and associated policy documents.

Byram's influence extends through his extensive publications, including seminal works such as *Teaching and Assessing Intercultural Communicative Competence* (1997) and *From Foreign Language Education to Education for Intercultural Citizenship* (2008). His 2021 book *Teaching and Assessing Intercultural Communicative Competence – Revisited* updates and extends his earlier work in response to contemporary challenges.

## The Concept of Intercultural Communicative Competence

### Historical Context and Development

Byram's work emerged from a recognition that foreign language teaching in the late twentieth century was insufficiently addressing the cultural dimensions of language learning. While communicative language teaching had revolutionised language classrooms by focusing on meaningful communication rather than grammatical analysis alone, Byram identified a significant gap: the communicative approach treated culture as secondary, often reduced to isolated facts about "target cultures" rather than as an integral part of what it means to communicate across linguistic and cultural boundaries.

In his seminal 1997 work *Teaching and Assessing Intercultural Communicative Competence*, Byram argued that "communicative competence" as traditionally conceived was inadequate for preparing learners for interaction in a globalised world. The native speaker had long been held as the ideal model for language learners, but Byram challenged this assumption, proposing instead the concept of the **"intercultural speaker"**—a person who can communicate effectively across cultural boundaries while recognising their own cultural identity and that of their interlocutors.

This reconceptualisation was significant because it shifted the goal of language education from imitation of native speakers to the development of a distinct competence: the ability to navigate between cultures, to communicate effectively and appropriately while maintaining one's own identity, and to act as a mediator between different cultural perspectives.

### The Five Savoirs: Components of ICC

Byram's model of Intercultural Communicative Competence (ICC) identifies five interconnected components, drawing on the French terminology of "savoirs" (knowings) to distinguish different types of knowledge and ability:

#### Savoirs (Knowledge)

**Savoirs** refers to knowledge of social groups and their products and practices in one's own country and in the country of the target language, as well as knowledge of the processes of interaction at individual and societal levels. This includes:

- Knowledge of history, geography, and political systems
- Understanding of social institutions and practices
- Awareness of artistic, literary, and cultural products
- Knowledge of how cultures interact and influence each other historically

Importantly, Byram emphasises that this knowledge is not merely factual but involves understanding the perspectives—values, beliefs, meanings—that underlie cultural practices. It is not enough to know *that* people in a particular culture celebrate certain festivals; learners must understand *why* these celebrations matter and what they signify to members of that culture.

#### Savoir Comprendre (Skills of Interpreting and Relating)

**Savoir comprendre** involves the ability to interpret a document or event from another culture, to explain it and relate it to documents or events from one's own culture. This skill includes:

- Identifying ethnocentric perspectives in one's own and others' interpretations
- Recognising and analysing phenomena that may be misunderstood or misinterpreted
- Comparing and contrasting cultural phenomena across cultures
- Explaining cultural practices to others

Byram describes this as the ability to "decouple" meaning from language and culture, to recognise that the same word or behaviour may carry different meanings in different contexts, and to mediate between these different interpretations.

#### Savoir Apprendre/Faire (Skills of Discovery and Interaction)

**Savoir apprendre/faire** encompasses the ability to acquire new knowledge of a culture and cultural practices and the ability to operate knowledge, attitudes and skills under the constraints of real-time communication and interaction. This involves:

- Using existing knowledge to discover new cultural information
- Asking questions appropriately to elicit cultural knowledge
- Interacting with people from other cultures in real-time
- Managing the unpredictability of authentic intercultural encounters

This dimension acknowledges that intercultural competence is not merely academic knowledge but involves practical skills that must function under the pressure of real communication.

#### Savoir Être (Attitudes)

**Savoir être**—attitudes—forms what Byram describes as the **"foundation of ICC."** Without appropriate attitudes, knowledge and skills cannot function effectively. The essential attitudes are:

- **Curiosity** and openness, readiness to suspend disbelief about other cultures and belief about one's own
- **Readiness to see other cultures as legitimate and equal** to one's own
- **Willingness to question** the assumptions and values of one's own culture
- **Tolerance of ambiguity** and uncertainty in intercultural situations

Byram emphasises that these attitudes must be genuine, not merely simulated. Developing them involves more than cognitive learning; it requires experiences that challenge learners' existing perspectives and encourage them to see the world from different viewpoints.

#### Savoir S'engager (Critical Cultural Awareness)

**Savoir s'engager**—critical cultural awareness or political education—involves the ability to evaluate critically and on the basis of explicit criteria perspectives, practices and products in one's own and other cultures and countries. This represents the highest level of ICC, where learners:

- Make informed evaluations of cultural practices and products
- Articulate their own values and how these influence their perspectives
- Engage with issues of social justice, human rights, and ethical questions across cultures
- Act as informed and responsible citizens in an intercultural world

This dimension connects language education explicitly with citizenship education and preparation for participation in democratic, culturally diverse societies.

## The Intercultural Speaker vs. The Native Speaker

### Critique of Native Speaker Norms

One of Byram's most significant contributions was his challenge to the native speaker ideal that had dominated language teaching. He argued that attempting to produce imitation native speakers was both unrealistic and undesirable:

**Unrealistic** because the vast majority of language learners will never achieve native-like proficiency, and defining success in these terms leads to inevitable failure and demotivation.

**Undesirable** because the goal of language education should not be to produce replicas of native speakers but to enable learners to communicate effectively as themselves, bringing their own perspectives and identities to intercultural encounters.

Byram proposed instead the concept of the **"intercultural speaker"**—a person who:
- Can communicate effectively and appropriately with people from other linguistic and cultural backgrounds
- Can act as a mediator between different cultural perspectives
- Maintains their own identity while engaging respectfully with others
- Can critique cultural practices and assumptions from an informed position

This reconceptualisation has profound implications for how success in language learning is defined and assessed. Rather than measuring learners against an impossible native speaker standard, educators can assess the development of intercultural competence in its own terms.

### Pedagogical Implications

The shift from native speaker to intercultural speaker as the goal of language education has significant pedagogical implications:

**Curriculum Design:** Language curricula must explicitly incorporate intercultural learning objectives alongside linguistic objectives. Culture cannot be treated as an optional extra or occasional enrichment activity.

**Materials Development:** Textbooks and learning materials must present culture not as static facts about "target countries" but as dynamic, contested, and diverse. They must provide opportunities for comparison and critical reflection.

**Assessment:** Traditional tests of grammatical accuracy and vocabulary knowledge are insufficient. Assessment must include measures of intercultural attitudes, skills of interpreting and relating, and critical cultural awareness.

**Teacher Development:** Teachers need preparation not only in language and linguistics but in intercultural theory, methods for developing intercultural competence, and their own intercultural development.

## The Council of Europe and Language Policy

### Byram's Role and Influence

Byram's work with the Council of Europe represents a significant example of the relationship between educational research and international policy. As adviser to the Language Policy Division and member of expert groups, he contributed to key documents that have shaped language education across Europe.

The Council of Europe's language education policy aims to:
- Protect linguistic and cultural diversity in Europe
- Promote plurilingual and intercultural education
- Develop democratic citizenship through language learning
- Ensure equitable access to quality language education

Byram's concept of intercultural communicative competence provided a theoretical foundation for these policy objectives, translating abstract goals into concrete educational outcomes.

### The Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR)

The CEFR, first published in 2001 and updated in a companion volume in 2018 and 2020, represents the most influential language education document in European history. Byram's influence is evident in several aspects:

**Plurilingualism:** The CEFR explicitly promotes plurilingualism—the development of a communicative repertoire including partial competences in several languages—rather than the traditional focus on separate monolingualisms.

**Mediation:** The 2018 Companion Volume significantly expands the concept of mediation, recognising that language users frequently act as mediators between languages and cultures, not merely as communicators in one language.

**Intercultural Competence:** The Framework explicitly addresses intercultural competence, drawing on Byram's work, and includes descriptors for pluricultural competence—the ability to navigate between different cultural contexts.

**Democratic Citizenship:** The connection between language learning and preparation for democratic citizenship, a central theme in Byram's later work, is embedded in the CEFR's underlying philosophy.

### The European Language Portfolio

The European Language Portfolio (ELP), developed under Council of Europe auspices, operationalises many of Byram's ideas. The Portfolio serves three functions:

**Pedagogical:** It supports learner reflection and self-assessment, encouraging metacognitive awareness of intercultural as well as linguistic development.

**Documentation:** It provides a record of linguistic and intercultural experiences and achievements.

**Reporting:** It offers a standardised format for reporting language qualifications and experiences.

Byram contributed to the theoretical foundation of the ELP, particularly its approach to intercultural experiences and self-assessment of intercultural competence.

## From Foreign Language Education to Intercultural Citizenship

### The Evolution of Byram's Thought

In his later work, particularly *From Foreign Language Education to Education for Intercultural Citizenship* (2008), Byram extended his earlier thinking to address broader questions of citizenship and democratic participation. He argued that language education could and should contribute to preparing young people for citizenship in culturally diverse democratic societies.

This represents an evolution from his earlier focus on communication competence to a broader educational vision. The goal is no longer simply to enable communication across cultural boundaries but to develop citizens who can:

- Participate actively in democratic processes at local, national, and international levels
- Engage critically with questions of social justice, human rights, and environmental responsibility
- Act as mediators between different cultural and linguistic communities
- Contribute to the development of inclusive, democratic societies

### The Intercultural Citizen

Byram's concept of the intercultural citizen builds on his earlier model of the intercultural speaker but adds explicitly political dimensions:

**Political Knowledge:** Understanding of political systems, processes, and issues at multiple levels from local to global.

**Political Skills:** Ability to engage in political processes, including advocacy, debate, and collaborative action.

**Political Values:** Commitment to democratic values, human rights, and social justice across cultural boundaries.

**Political Action:** Willingness and ability to act as a citizen, not merely to observe political processes.

This reconceptualisation positions language education as a form of citizenship education, with significant implications for curriculum content and pedagogy.

### Pedagogical Approaches for Intercultural Citizenship

Byram and his collaborators have developed and tested pedagogical approaches for developing intercultural citizenship:

**Intercultural Exchanges:** Technology-mediated exchanges between learners in different countries, enabling authentic intercultural communication and collaboration.

**Service Learning:** Integration of community service with language learning, engaging learners with linguistically and culturally diverse communities in their local areas.

**Critical Incident Analysis:** Systematic analysis of intercultural encounters—both real and hypothetical—to develop skills of interpreting and relating.

**Comparative Analysis:** Structured comparison of social and political issues across cultures, developing knowledge and critical awareness.

**Action Projects:** Learner-initiated projects addressing intercultural or social issues, combining language use with active citizenship.

## Critiques and Developments

### Critiques of Byram's Model

Byram's model has been subject to various critiques and has evolved in response:

**Complexity of Assessment:** The five savoirs are difficult to assess, particularly attitudes (savoir être) and critical awareness (savoir s'engager). Byram has acknowledged these challenges and proposed various assessment approaches, including portfolio assessment and dialogue-based evaluation.

**Cultural Essentialism:** Some critics have suggested that discussing "cultures" as distinct entities risks essentialising and stereotyping. Byram's later work emphasises the fluid, contested nature of culture and the importance of recognising diversity within cultural groups.

**Power and Inequality:** Critics from critical pedagogy perspectives have argued that Byram's model insufficiently addresses questions of power, inequality, and colonial legacy in intercultural relations. His later work increasingly engages with these questions, particularly through the lens of critical cultural awareness.

**Assessment Constraints:** Traditional examination systems often struggle to accommodate the holistic, developmental nature of intercultural competence. Byram has advocated for assessment reform while recognising the constraints within which teachers operate.

### Recent Developments

Byram's 2021 book *Teaching and Assessing Intercultural Communicative Competence – Revisited* updates his model in several respects:

**Critical Intercultural Competence:** Greater emphasis on critical perspectives, power relations, and social justice.

**Linguaculture:** Engagement with the concept of "linguaculture"—the inseparability of language and culture in communicative practice.

**Assessment Innovation:** New approaches to assessment including technology-mediated observation and portfolio-based evaluation.

**Teacher Education:** Enhanced attention to the intercultural development of teachers themselves, recognising that teachers cannot develop intercultural competence in learners that they have not developed themselves.

## Implications for UK MFL Teaching

### National Curriculum and GCSE Specifications

Byram's work has influenced UK language education policy, though often implicitly. The National Curriculum for Languages references intercultural understanding as a key strand, and GCSE specifications require engagement with cultural contexts. However, the operationalisation of intercultural competence in assessment remains limited, with examinations focusing primarily on linguistic accuracy and transactional communication.

Teachers seeking to implement Byram's vision face challenges:

**Assessment Pressure:** The dominance of high-stakes examinations can marginalise intercultural learning in favour of linguistic accuracy.

**Time Constraints:** The packed curriculum leaves limited time for the extended activities and reflection that intercultural development requires.

**Teacher Preparation:** Many teachers have not received preparation in intercultural theory and pedagogy during their initial training.

**Resource Limitations:** Authentic intercultural exchange requires resources—technology, partnerships with schools abroad, travel opportunities—that are not equally available to all schools.

### Practical Applications

Despite these challenges, teachers can incorporate Byram's principles:

**Embedding Culture:** Ensuring that cultural content is integrated throughout teaching rather than treated as occasional enrichment.

**Comparison and Reflection:** Regular activities that encourage learners to compare cultures and reflect on their own perspectives.

**Authentic Materials:** Using authentic materials from target language communities, including diverse voices and perspectives.

**Critical Analysis:** Encouraging critical analysis of cultural products and practices, including stereotypes and representations.

**Virtual Exchange:** Participating in virtual exchange programmes that enable authentic intercultural communication.

**Assessment of Attitudes:** Including self-assessment and reflection on intercultural attitudes alongside traditional language assessment.

## Legacy and Continuing Relevance

Michael Byram's contribution to language education extends far beyond his specific publications. He has:

- **Established intercultural competence** as a central objective of language education
- **Challenged the native speaker ideal** and proposed the intercultural speaker as a more appropriate goal
- **Connected language education** to broader educational purposes including citizenship and social justice
- **Influenced international policy** through his work with the Council of Europe
- **Developed practical frameworks** that teachers can use to design, implement, and assess intercultural learning

His work remains highly relevant in the contemporary context of:

**Globalisation:** Increasing connectedness across cultural boundaries makes intercultural competence more essential than ever.

**Migration and Diversity:** Schools across Europe are becoming more culturally diverse, requiring all teachers—not just language teachers—to engage with intercultural education.

**Digital Communication:** Online communication creates new opportunities and challenges for intercultural interaction.

**Political Polarisation:** The need for citizens who can engage critically and constructively across cultural and political differences is increasingly urgent.

Byram's model of intercultural communicative competence provides a robust theoretical framework and practical guidance for language educators seeking to prepare learners for participation in an intercultural world. While implementation challenges remain, his work offers a vision of language education that goes far beyond transactional communication to encompass the development of knowledgeable, skilled, and critically aware intercultural citizens.

## Key Concepts for Teachers

### The Intercultural Speaker in Practice

Understanding what the "intercultural speaker" looks like in practice helps teachers translate Byram's theory into classroom reality. An intercultural speaker:

**In a restaurant abroad:** Does not simply order correctly using appropriate vocabulary and grammar, but notices differences in dining customs, responds appropriately to unfamiliar service styles, and can discuss these differences with dining companions from different backgrounds.

**In a classroom discussion:** Can present their own cultural perspective on a topic (e.g., school systems, family structures, environmental attitudes) while acknowledging that this is one perspective among many, and can engage respectfully with perspectives that differ from their own.

**When encountering stereotypes:** Can recognise stereotypes in media representations and everyday discourse, understand their origins and functions, and respond critically rather than simply accepting or rejecting them uncritically.

**When misunderstandings occur:** Can analyse the cultural dimensions of miscommunication, recognise their own contribution to the problem, and work toward resolution rather than assigning blame.

### Developing the Five Savoirs in the Classroom

Teachers can address each of Byram's five savoirs through specific classroom activities:

**Developing Savoirs (Knowledge):**
- Comparative analysis of news coverage of the same event in different countries
- Investigation of historical events from multiple national perspectives
- Analysis of how cultural products (films, music, literature) reflect and shape cultural values
- Study of migration patterns and their cultural impacts

**Developing Savoir Comprendre (Skills of Interpreting and Relating):**
- Analysis of cultural "false friends"—words or behaviours that seem similar but carry different meanings
- Interpretation of culturally specific references in texts
- Comparison of how different cultures conceptualise abstract concepts (time, family, individual vs. collective responsibility)
- Role-play activities requiring explanation of cultural practices to outsiders

**Developing Savoir Apprendre/Faire (Skills of Discovery and Interaction):**
- Research projects where learners investigate cultural topics using target language sources
- Virtual exchanges with partner schools abroad
- Interviews with speakers of the target language in the local community
- Simulation activities requiring real-time problem-solving in unfamiliar cultural contexts

**Developing Savoir Être (Attitudes):**
- Structured reflection activities following cultural encounters
- Discussion of "culture shock" experiences and strategies for managing them
- Analysis of ethnocentric perspectives in media and everyday discourse
- Mindfulness activities that develop openness to uncertainty and ambiguity

**Developing Savoir S'engager (Critical Cultural Awareness):**
- Analysis of social issues (education, environment, inequality) from multiple cultural perspectives
- Evaluation of cultural practices against explicit ethical criteria
- Discussion of human rights and their cultural interpretation
- Projects that connect classroom learning to active citizenship

### Byram's Model and Differentiation

Byram's framework supports differentiation across the ability range:

**For Less Confident Learners:**
- Focus on savoirs (knowledge) and basic savoir comprendre through guided activities
- Structured support for interpreting cultural information
- Emphasis on openness and curiosity (foundational attitudes)

**For More Advanced Learners:**
- Greater emphasis on savoir apprendre/faire through independent research and authentic interaction
- Development of sophisticated savoir comprendre through analysis of complex texts
- Engagement with savoir s'engager through critical analysis and citizenship projects

### Connecting to Other Educational Frameworks

Byram's work connects productively with other influential frameworks:

**Bloom's Taxonomy:** The five savoirs align with higher-order thinking skills, particularly analysis, evaluation, and creation.

**Social and Emotional Learning (SEL):** The emphasis on attitudes, self-awareness, and responsible decision-making connects to SEL competencies.

**Global Citizenship Education:** Byram's later work on intercultural citizenship directly contributes to global citizenship frameworks.

**Critical Pedagogy:** The emphasis on critical cultural awareness and questioning power relations connects to critical pedagogical traditions.

## Assessment Strategies

### Assessing Intercultural Competence

Byram acknowledges the challenges of assessing intercultural competence, particularly its attitudinal and developmental dimensions. He proposes several approaches:

**Portfolio Assessment:**
Learners compile evidence of their intercultural development over time, including:
- Reflections on intercultural experiences
- Analysis of cultural products
- Documentation of intercultural interactions
- Self-assessment against the five savoirs

**Dialogic Assessment:**
Assessment through structured dialogue between teacher and learner, exploring the learner's intercultural development through conversation rather than written tests.

**Observation:**
Structured observation of learners during intercultural activities, with assessment criteria aligned to Byram's framework.

**Critical Incident Analysis:**
Presentation and analysis of critical intercultural incidents, demonstrating skills of interpreting and relating.

### Challenges in Formal Assessment

Traditional examination systems present challenges for assessing intercultural competence:

**Attitudes are difficult to examine:** Paper-based examinations struggle to assess genuine attitudes rather than rehearsed responses.

**Cultural knowledge dates quickly:** Factual knowledge about countries changes rapidly, making examination questions quickly obsolete.

**Skills require authentic contexts:** Skills of discovery and interaction require authentic intercultural situations, difficult to recreate in examination conditions.

**Critical awareness is sensitive:** Assessment of critical cultural awareness may touch on controversial topics, requiring sensitive handling.

Byram advocates for assessment reform while recognising that teachers must work within existing systems. He suggests that portfolio and coursework components can complement traditional examinations, providing space for intercultural development to be recognised and rewarded.

## The Future of Intercultural Language Education

### Emerging Challenges

Byram's work continues to evolve in response to emerging challenges:

**Digital Communication:** New forms of online communication create novel intercultural situations requiring new competencies.

**Transcultural Flows:** Increasing mobility and connectivity mean that cultures are no longer tied to specific geographical locations, requiring new ways of thinking about intercultural encounter.

**Political Polarisation:** Rising nationalism and xenophobia challenge the values underlying intercultural education.

**Climate Change:** Global environmental challenges require unprecedented levels of intercultural cooperation and understanding.

**Artificial Intelligence:** Machine translation raises questions about the purposes of language learning, potentially freeing space for greater emphasis on intercultural dimensions.

### Continuing Relevance

Despite these challenges—and partly because of them—Byram's work remains essential for language educators. His insistence that language teaching serves broader educational purposes, his recognition of the centrality of culture in language, and his practical frameworks for curriculum and assessment development provide resources for teachers navigating the complexities of twenty-first century education.

The intercultural speaker, mediating between perspectives, questioning assumptions, and engaging critically yet respectfully with difference, represents an educational ideal that transcends the specifics of language teaching to address fundamental questions of how we prepare young people for life in a diverse, interconnected world.
