# Vicky Gough: British Council MFL Policy and Advocacy

## Overview and Professional Background

Vicky Gough serves as Schools Adviser at the British Council, where she has established herself as one of the most influential voices in modern foreign languages (MFL) education policy in England. In her role, Gough leads the British Council's extensive research and advocacy work on language learning in UK schools, overseeing the annual Language Trends survey series that has become the definitive barometer of MFL provision across the country. Her work bridges the gap between academic research, classroom practice, and national policy, making her insights essential reading for curriculum leaders, head teachers, and policy makers.

Gough's position at the British Council places her at the intersection of educational policy and international cultural relations. The British Council, as the United Kingdom's international organisation for cultural relations and educational opportunities, provides Gough with a unique platform to influence both domestic language policy and the UK's international standing in language education. Through her leadership of the Language Trends research programme, Gough has amassed over a decade of longitudinal data on MFL provision, making her one of the foremost authorities on the state of language learning in English schools.

Her advocacy extends beyond research publication to active engagement with government, professional associations, and school leaders. Gough frequently presents at major education conferences, contributes to parliamentary inquiries, and works directly with the Department for Education on language policy initiatives. Her collaborative approach has seen her partner with examination boards, subject associations such as the Association for Language Learning (ALL), and international bodies including the Council of Europe and the European Union on language education working groups.

## The Language Trends Research Programme

### Methodology and Scope

Under Vicky Gough's direction, the Language Trends survey has evolved into the most comprehensive annual study of language provision in English schools. The 2025 edition surveyed over 1,500 primary, secondary, and independent schools, providing robust data on uptake, provision, teacher recruitment, and pupil attitudes. Conducted in partnership with Queen's University Belfast and led by Dr Ian Collen, the research employs rigorous quantitative and qualitative methods to track trends over time and identify emerging challenges.

The survey's methodology has been refined over successive iterations to capture the complex realities of language education. Primary school responses focus on curriculum time allocation, specialist teacher availability, and transition arrangements to secondary school. Secondary data encompasses GCSE and A-level uptake across different language combinations, teacher recruitment difficulties, and the impact of accountability measures such as the English Baccalaureate (EBacc) and Progress 8. This multi-dimensional approach enables Gough and her team to identify correlations between policy changes and classroom outcomes.

### Key Findings and Trends

The Language Trends reports authored and overseen by Gough have documented a persistent crisis in language education that has worsened over the past decade. The 2024 survey revealed that six in ten secondary schools faced significant challenges recruiting qualified language teachers, a figure that represents a substantial barrier to improving MFL provision. This recruitment crisis disproportionately affects schools in areas of social deprivation, creating what Gough has termed a "widening gap" in language education.

Perhaps most concerning are the stark socio-economic inequalities that Gough's research has exposed. The Language Trends England 2025 report found that students at the most affluent state schools are more than 20 percentage points more likely to take a language GCSE than those at the least affluent schools. This finding represents not merely an educational inequality but what Gough describes as a "social divide" that threatens to lock disadvantaged pupils out of the cultural and economic benefits of language learning.

Gough's research has also tracked the uneven impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on language learning. The 2022 Language Trends report documented how the pandemic disrupted teaching and learning, with particular impact on speaking skills and oral examination preparation. Gough noted that "the past couple of years have been extremely challenging for schools," with language learning suffering from reduced curriculum time and the difficulties of remote instruction for communicative language teaching.

### International Comparative Dimension

Beyond domestic findings, Gough's work positions English language education within a broader European and global context. The British Council's research consistently shows that the UK's language deficit is exceptional among comparable developed nations. While pupils in many European countries routinely study two or more languages to a high level, English pupils increasingly drop languages after Key Stage 3, with only 46% taking a language GCSE as of recent data.

Gough has been particularly vocal about the economic and cultural consequences of this decline. Her research highlights employer demand for language skills and the UK's underperformance in international trade and diplomacy linked to monolingualism. This international perspective strengthens her advocacy for policy intervention, framing language education not merely as a curriculum issue but as a matter of national competitiveness and global engagement.

## MFL Uptake Crisis: Analysis and Advocacy

### The Post-2004 Decline

Vicky Gough's analysis of MFL uptake traces the roots of the current crisis to the 2004 decision to make languages optional at Key Stage 4. Following this policy change, GCSE language entries plummeted, with uptake falling from approximately 80% of pupils to below 50% within a decade. Gough's research documents how this decline has continued despite subsequent policy interventions, creating a structural weakness in English education that successive governments have failed to reverse.

The introduction of the English Baccalaureate (EBacc) in 2010 represented the most significant attempt to halt this decline. By including a language within the EBacc performance measure, the government sought to incentivise schools to increase language uptake. Gough's research confirms that the EBacc initially succeeded in this aim: following its introduction, the proportion of pupils studying a language at GCSE rose from 40% to a peak of 49% in 2014. However, Gough has documented how this recovery stalled and then reversed, with uptake falling back to 46% by 2018 and remaining stubbornly below government targets.

### The Social Divide in Language Learning

Perhaps the most significant contribution of Gough's research has been to expose and quantify the social inequalities embedded within language provision. Her analysis consistently demonstrates that access to language learning in England is determined by socio-economic status, creating what she describes as a "two-tier system" that privileges pupils in affluent areas and independent schools.

The Language Trends England 2025 report provided stark evidence of this divide. Pupils at independent schools are significantly more likely to take language GCSEs than their state school peers, and within the state sector, there exists a more than 20 percentage point gap between the most and least affluent schools. Gough has emphasised that "the opportunity to learn a language should be open to everyone, regardless of what kind of school they attend," framing this inequality not merely as an educational issue but as a matter of social justice.

Gough's analysis links this divide to differential teacher recruitment. Schools in disadvantaged areas report greater difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified language teachers, creating a vicious cycle in which the pupils who would most benefit from the social mobility opportunities that language learning provides are least likely to receive quality provision. Her research shows that the teacher shortage is "more acute" in areas of social deprivation, exacerbating existing inequalities.

### Barriers to Uptake

Gough's research has identified multiple interconnected barriers that prevent pupils from continuing with language study. Severe grading at GCSE, whereby language subjects are statistically more difficult to achieve high grades in than comparable EBacc subjects, creates a perverse incentive for schools and pupils to avoid languages. Her analysis shows that, on average, pupils achieve grades up to one grade lower in MFL than in other subjects of comparable difficulty, affecting school performance measures and pupil options.

Pupil attitudes represent another significant barrier. British Council research commissioned by Gough's team has explored Year 9 pupils' perceptions of language learning, revealing widespread beliefs that languages are irrelevant to future careers and excessively difficult compared to other options. Gough has emphasised the need to address these misconceptions through careers guidance that highlights employer demand for language skills and curriculum design that demonstrates the practical applications of language learning.

The lack of continuity between primary and secondary provision creates additional barriers. Gough's research documents how variable primary MFL provision results in pupils arriving at secondary school with widely disparate experiences of language learning. Without reliable foundations from Key Stage 2, secondary teachers face the challenge of teaching mixed-ability classes where some pupils have had several years of language tuition while others have had minimal exposure.

## Policy Positions and Recommendations

### On Compulsory Language Learning

Vicky Gough has been a consistent advocate for making languages compulsory at Key Stage 4, arguing that optional status has created the structural conditions for decline. Her position aligns with calls from professional associations and academic researchers for a statutory requirement that would ensure all pupils continue language study to age 16. Gough has argued that "good intentions alone will not help us introduce languages such as Chinese and Arabic into the curriculum," emphasising that firm policy action is required to reverse current trends.

However, Gough's advocacy for compulsion is nuanced and conditional. Her research emphasises that mandatory status must be accompanied by investment in teacher recruitment, curriculum reform, and assessment adjustments. Simply requiring pupils to study languages without addressing severe grading or teacher shortages risks damaging pupil motivation and subject reputation further. Gough has called for a comprehensive approach that combines accountability measures with support for implementation.

### On Assessment and Accountability

Gough has been vocal in calling for reform of GCSE MFL assessment, particularly regarding the issue of severe grading. Her research documents how the statistical difficulty of achieving high grades in languages disadvantages pupils and schools, creating incentives to steer pupils towards subjects where higher grades are more readily achievable. She has supported calls for comparable outcomes methodology to be adjusted to recognise the particular challenges of language assessment.

Regarding accountability measures, Gough has analysed the complex relationship between the EBacc, Progress 8, and language uptake. While supporting the principle of the EBacc as a means to ensure breadth of study, she has noted the tension created by Progress 8's focus on progress rather than specific subject inclusion. Her research suggests that schools' strategic responses to accountability metrics have not always favoured languages, even when they form part of headline performance measures.

### On Teacher Supply and Development

The recruitment and retention of language teachers represents a central pillar of Gough's policy advocacy. Her research consistently documents the scale of teacher shortages and their disproportionate impact on disadvantaged schools. Gough has called for targeted incentives to attract language graduates into teaching, including bursaries, retention payments for shortage subjects, and career progression pathways that recognise the specialist skills of language educators.

Beyond initial recruitment, Gough has emphasised the importance of continuing professional development (CPD) for language teachers. The Ofsted research review on languages (2021) identified low expectations and variable pedagogical knowledge as barriers to effective provision. Gough has advocated for investment in subject-specific CPD that equips teachers with the knowledge and skills to implement evidence-informed approaches, particularly in phonics, vocabulary instruction, and grammar teaching.

## The National Centre for Languages Education (NCLE)

### Hub School Initiative

A significant development in recent MFL policy has been the creation of the National Centre for Languages Education (NCLE), a network of lead hub schools designed to build capacity and share expertise across the system. Vicky Gough has been closely involved in this initiative, which represents a strategic response to the challenges her research has documented.

The NCLE model establishes hub schools as centres of excellence that work with partner schools to improve language provision. These hubs receive additional funding and support to develop innovative practice, provide CPD, and create sustainable partnerships that extend their impact beyond individual institutions. Gough has described this network as offering "hope for the future," providing a mechanism for spreading effective practice to schools that would otherwise struggle to access specialist expertise.

### Gough's Role and Vision

Through her position at the British Council, Gough has facilitated connections between the NCLE, international partners, and research institutions. Her vision for the hub network emphasises both excellence and equity, seeking to ensure that the benefits of hub status reach schools in areas of greatest need. The British Council has supported hub schools in developing international partnerships, providing access to language assistants, and connecting them with professional networks that enhance their capacity.

Gough has been clear that hub schools alone cannot solve the systemic challenges facing MFL education. She presents the NCLE as part of a broader strategy that must include policy reform, assessment adjustment, and sustained investment. Her advocacy positions the hub network as a necessary but insufficient condition for reversing language decline, requiring complementary action on the structural barriers her research has identified.

## Pedagogical Implications for Curriculum Leaders

### Evidence-Informed Practice

Vicky Gough's research provides curriculum leaders with robust evidence to inform MFL curriculum design and implementation. Her analysis of the Ofsted research review on languages, combined with Language Trends findings on provision and outcomes, enables school leaders to benchmark their practice against national patterns and identify areas for development. Gough emphasises the importance of explicit teaching of phonics, vocabulary, and grammar, arguing that communicative competence builds upon secure foundational knowledge.

For primary curriculum leaders, Gough's research on transition offers practical guidance. The variability of primary MFL provision documented in Language Trends suggests that secondary schools must develop robust assessment of incoming pupils' prior knowledge and adapt Key Stage 3 curricula accordingly. Gough advocates for collaborative planning between feeder primary schools and secondary departments to create coherent progression rather than repeated beginner content.

### Addressing Disadvantage

Gough's exposure of the socio-economic divide in language provision has significant implications for schools serving disadvantaged communities. Her research suggests that these schools face a triple challenge: greater difficulty recruiting teachers, lower baseline uptake, and pupil populations less likely to have access to language learning opportunities outside school. Curriculum leaders must develop targeted strategies that address these compounding disadvantages.

Gough's advocacy for equitable access supports approaches that explicitly prioritise MFL provision in disadvantaged schools. This may involve creative staffing solutions, such as shared specialist teachers across primary schools or partnerships with secondary providers; curriculum models that maximise engagement and success; and enrichment activities that demonstrate the value and relevance of language learning to pupils and families.

### Building Pupil Motivation

The attitudinal research overseen by Gough highlights the importance of addressing pupils' perceptions of language learning. Curriculum leaders should ensure that careers guidance explicitly addresses the value of language skills in the labour market, countering the misconception that languages are irrelevant to future employment. Gough's research on employer demand provides evidence that can inform these conversations, demonstrating the economic value of multilingualism across multiple sectors.

International partnerships and authentic communication opportunities represent another strategy supported by Gough's work. The British Council's programmes for school linking, language assistants, and international visits provide contexts that demonstrate the practical value of language learning. Gough's research suggests that such experiences can significantly impact pupil motivation, particularly when embedded within coherent curriculum planning rather than treated as isolated enrichment activities.

## Contribution to National Policy Discourse

### Parliamentary and Government Engagement

Vicky Gough's influence extends to the highest levels of educational policy making. Her research is routinely cited in House of Commons and House of Lords library briefings on language education, and she has provided evidence to parliamentary inquiries on MFL provision. The 2024 House of Lords Library briefing on modern foreign language education in England drew extensively on Language Trends findings, demonstrating the authoritative status of Gough's research within policy circles.

At the Department for Education, Gough has contributed to working groups on language policy, curriculum review, and teacher supply. Her evidence-based approach has informed discussions on the implementation of the NCLE, the review of GCSE MFL specifications, and the ongoing evaluation of the EBacc policy. This engagement ensures that practitioner perspectives and research evidence inform policy development.

### Professional Association Collaboration

Gough maintains active collaboration with subject associations, particularly the Association for Language Learning (ALL), which represents MFL teachers across all phases. Her research provides the evidence base for ALL advocacy campaigns, while professional association networks facilitate the dissemination of Language Trends findings to classroom practitioners. This partnership model ensures that research informs practice and that practitioner experience shapes research priorities.

Her conference presentations and professional development inputs provide opportunities for dialogue between researchers, policy makers, and teachers. Gough's accessible communication style and clear policy recommendations make her research valuable for busy practitioners seeking to understand the national context of their work. By bridging research and practice, she strengthens the evidence culture within the MFL teaching community.

### International Advocacy

Through the British Council, Gough contributes to international discussions on language education policy. Her comparative analysis positions English provision within European and global contexts, informing debates about the UK's international competitiveness and cultural relations. The Council of Europe and EU working groups on which she has served enable knowledge exchange with jurisdictions that have maintained stronger language provision, identifying strategies that might transfer to the English context.

This international dimension strengthens Gough's domestic advocacy by demonstrating that high-quality universal language provision is achievable. Her research counters narratives that suggest language learning is inevitably in decline or that English-speaking countries cannot achieve multilingualism. By showing what is possible elsewhere, Gough makes the case that English underperformance represents policy failure rather than cultural destiny.

## Legacy and Ongoing Impact

### Research Legacy

Vicky Gough's leadership of the Language Trends programme has created a research legacy that will inform understanding of English language education for years to come. The longitudinal dataset she has built provides unprecedented insight into the impact of policy changes, the evolution of provision across phases, and the persistent challenges facing MFL education. Future researchers and policy analysts will rely upon this evidence base to evaluate interventions and track progress.

Her methodological contribution extends beyond data collection to the integration of quantitative and qualitative approaches. The Language Trends surveys combine statistical analysis with teacher voice, capturing both the scale of challenges and the lived experience of practitioners. This mixed-methods approach provides nuanced understanding that pure quantitative analysis could not achieve.

### Policy Impact

Gough's advocacy has directly influenced significant policy developments, from the creation of the NCLE to ongoing discussions of curriculum reform and assessment adjustment. Her research provided the evidence base that justified investment in hub schools and continues to inform debate about the future of the EBacc and GCSE languages. While policy change has been slower than Gough's analysis suggests is necessary, her evidence has shifted the terms of debate and established language education as a priority issue.

The growing recognition of the social divide in language access, documented through Gough's research, has implications for broader education policy discussions about equity and social mobility. By showing that language learning opportunities are stratified by socio-economic status, Gough has connected MFL policy to central government priorities, strengthening the case for intervention.

### Continuing Challenges

Despite significant advocacy efforts, the challenges Gough has documented persist and in some respects have worsened. Language teacher recruitment remains critically low, uptake continues to decline in some contexts, and the social divide in access shows little sign of narrowing. Gough herself acknowledges that "we must invest at post-16 to ensure a healthier pipeline into Further and Higher Education, and indeed the economy," recognising that sustainable improvement requires long-term commitment across multiple policy areas.
