# Suzanne Graham: Key Thinker in Language Education

## Overview

**Suzanne Graham** is Professor of Language and Education at the Institute of Education, University of Reading, and Subject Leader for PGCE Secondary Modern Foreign Languages. She is one of the most influential researchers in UK language education, with her work fundamentally shaping how teachers understand and teach listening comprehension, learner motivation, and the transition between primary and secondary language learning. Her research has had demonstrable impact on initial teacher education, classroom practice in secondary schools, and curriculum and materials development both nationally and internationally.

Graham's scholarly contribution centres on three interconnected domains: the cognitive and metacognitive strategies that underpin successful listening in a foreign language; the motivational factors that influence learners' decisions to continue (or discontinue) language study, particularly at points of educational transition; and the preparedness of learners moving from primary to secondary language education. Her work is characterised by rigorous empirical methodology, close attention to classroom realities, and a commitment to translating research findings into practical pedagogical guidance for teachers.

## Biographical and Academic Background

### Early Career and Research Trajectory

Suzanne Graham's journey into language education research was sparked by a fundamental question: why do some individuals continue with language learning to higher levels whilst others abandon the endeavour, and why are some more successful at making this transition than others? This inquiry formed the foundation of her doctoral research, which examined learners' motivations, learning strategies, and decisions regarding continued language study.

Her early work established the conceptual frameworks that would define her career—the inextricable links between what learners do (strategies), how capable they believe themselves to be (self-efficacy), and whether they choose to persist (motivation). From these foundations, Graham developed a research programme that has spanned three decades and produced some of the most cited work in the field of second language education.

### Current Position and Responsibilities

At the University of Reading, Graham holds the position of Professor of Language and Education and serves as Subject Leader for the PGCE Secondary Modern Foreign Languages programme. In this dual capacity, she bridges the worlds of research and teacher education, ensuring that evidence-informed practices are embedded in the preparation of new language teachers. She also serves as Unit of Assessment Lead for Education within the university's research structure.

Her institutional role places her at the centre of language teacher education in England, with direct influence over how hundreds of beginning teachers conceptualise and enact their pedagogy. This position amplifies the impact of her research, as her findings are transmitted not only through academic publication but through the daily practice of teachers she has trained.

## Research on Listening Strategies and Comprehension

### The Listening Comprehension Challenge

Graham's most significant contribution to language education lies in her sustained investigation of second language listening comprehension—a skill that she argues has been systematically undertheorised and poorly taught in UK schools. Her research reveals a paradox: listening is the most frequently used language skill in real-world communication, yet it receives the least systematic attention in classroom instruction.

Through extensive classroom observation and teacher interviews, Graham and her collaborators documented what she terms a "comprehension approach" to listening prevalent in UK secondary schools. In this approach, listening activities function primarily as tests of comprehension rather than opportunities for skill development. Teachers play audio material once or twice, learners attempt to answer comprehension questions, and correct answers are checked—without explicit attention to the processes by which understanding is (or is not) achieved.

### Metacognitive and Cognitive Strategies

Graham's research distinguishes between two types of strategies that support listening comprehension. **Cognitive strategies** are the mental processes learners employ to understand what they hear—predicting content based on context, inferring meaning from familiar words, monitoring comprehension, and evaluating whether understanding has been achieved. **Metacognitive strategies** involve planning, monitoring, and evaluating one's listening process—thinking about how one is listening, not merely what one is hearing.

Her studies demonstrate that successful listeners deploy a wider and more flexible repertoire of these strategies than less successful listeners. Crucially, strategic behaviour can be taught. Graham's intervention studies show that explicit strategy instruction leads to measurable improvements in listening proficiency, particularly for lower-intermediate learners.

### The Esmée Fairbairn Listening Project

The landmark **"Second Language Listening Comprehension in England: From Current Practice to Improved Pedagogy"** project, funded by the Esmée Fairbairn Foundation, represents Graham's most comprehensive investigation of listening pedagogy. Conducted in two phases, the project first investigated teachers' beliefs about and understanding of listening comprehension teaching, then developed and evaluated materials to improve teachers' ability to teach listening as a skill.

Phase One findings were sobering. Many teachers held limited conceptualisations of listening as a skill, viewing it primarily as a vehicle for testing rather than teaching. Few had received explicit preparation for teaching listening during their initial teacher education. Listening activities were often designed with minimal attention to the cognitive processes involved, and post-listening feedback focused on whether answers were correct rather than how learners arrived at their understanding.

Phase Two involved the development and dissemination of professional development materials based on Graham's research. These materials, rolled out through workshops for teachers and initial teacher education tutors, introduced participants to a pedagogical model emphasising:

- **Pre-listening activities** that activate prior knowledge and establish purpose
- **During-listening support** that guides learners' attention and strategic processing
- **Post-listening reflection** that develops metacognitive awareness

The project's materials continue to influence listening pedagogy in UK schools and initial teacher education programmes.

### The Professional Development Consortium in MFL

Building on the listening project, Graham led the **Professional Development Consortium in MFL**, a joint initiative between the Universities of Reading and Oxford supported by the ESRC Follow-on Fund. This project aimed to bridge the persistent gap between research evidence on effective language teaching and actual classroom practice.

The Consortium developed eight evidence-informed principles for language teaching, grounded in Graham's research and that of her collaborator Professor Ernesto Macaro:

1. **Maximise use of the target language** while recognising the strategic role of the first language
2. **Create a supportive and collaborative learning environment** that reduces anxiety
3. **Develop learners' independence** through strategy instruction
4. **Focus on meaning** while not neglecting form
5. **Integrate attention to form within meaningful contexts**
6. **Promote the development of learning strategies** explicitly and systematically
7. **Encourage learners to reflect on their learning** and develop metacognitive awareness
8. **Consider the affective dimension** of language learning, including motivation and self-efficacy

These principles synthesise decades of research into actionable guidance for teachers. The Consortium's workshops and materials reached hundreds of teachers across England, establishing a model for research-informed professional development that continues to influence the field.

## Research on Learner Motivation

### Motivation at Points of Educational Transition

Graham's research into motivation has consistently focused on **points of educational transition**—moments when learners make significant decisions about whether to continue with language study. Her work examines the transition from primary to secondary school, from Key Stage 3 to Key Stage 4 (GCSE), and from secondary to higher education.

These transitions are critical junctures in the UK's educational system. Language learning is compulsory at Key Stage 3 (ages 11-14) but becomes optional at Key Stage 4—a policy change that has contributed to dramatic declines in language uptake since 2004. Graham's research illuminates why some learners choose to continue whilst others opt out, and how educational experiences might be designed to sustain motivation through these decision points.

### Self-Efficacy and Strategic Competence

A central finding of Graham's motivation research is the **interconnection between self-efficacy (belief in one's capabilities) and strategic competence**. Learners who believe they can succeed at language tasks are more likely to invest effort, persist through difficulties, and ultimately achieve success. This self-efficacy is not merely a personality trait but is shaped by experience—particularly experiences of strategic success.

Graham's research demonstrates that when learners develop effective strategies for tackling language tasks, their self-efficacy increases. This enhanced confidence motivates continued engagement, which in turn provides further opportunities for strategy development and skill improvement. Graham conceptualises this as a **virtuous cycle of strategy use, self-efficacy, and motivation**:

**Effective strategy use → Task success → Enhanced self-efficacy → Increased motivation → Continued engagement → Further strategy development**

Conversely, learners who lack strategic resources experience repeated failure or partial success, undermining their self-efficacy and motivation—a vicious cycle that often culminates in abandonment of language study at the first opportunity.

### The GCSE Transition

Graham's research on the transition to GCSE is particularly significant given the policy context. Her studies track learners from Year 9 (final year of compulsory language study) through their GCSE courses, examining how motivational trajectories predict uptake and achievement.

Key findings include:

- **Listening self-efficacy** is a particularly strong predictor of continued language study and eventual GCSE performance
- Learners' **attributions for success and failure** (whether they credit effort, ability, task difficulty, or luck) shape their willingness to persist
- **Teacher feedback practices** influence motivational trajectories, with process-focused feedback supporting continued engagement better than person-focused praise
- **Progress visibility**—learners' ability to perceive their own improvement over time—sustains motivation through challenging periods

These findings have direct implications for Key Stage 3 pedagogy. Graham argues that the years of compulsory language study should be viewed not merely as preparation for potential GCSE study but as a critical window for establishing the strategic competence and self-efficacy that will influence learners' post-14 decisions.

## Primary to Secondary Transition Research

### The Nuffield Primary Modern Languages Project

Graham's **Nuffield-funded Primary Modern Languages project** (2012-2014), conducted with colleagues from Applied Linguistics and Clinical Language Sciences, investigated the teaching of French in primary schools and its impact on learners' grammatical knowledge and preparedness for secondary school language learning.

The two-year study followed learners from Year 5 (age 9-10) through their first year of secondary school (Year 7, age 11-12), measuring language outcomes through oral production tasks including sentence repetition and photo description activities. This longitudinal design allowed Graham to assess not only what primary learners knew but how well this knowledge prepared them for secondary school expectations.

### Key Findings on Preparedness

The project yielded important findings about the primary-secondary transition:

**Quantity of teaching time matters significantly.** Learners who received more hours of language instruction in primary school demonstrated better preparedness for secondary language learning. Schools offering only minimal time allocations (often 30-45 minutes weekly) produced learners with limited linguistic foundations.

**Teacher language proficiency is influential.** Learners taught by teachers with stronger French proficiency made greater progress. This finding has implications for workforce development, suggesting that primary language teaching requires teachers with genuine competence in the target language—not merely non-specialists delivering scripted programmes.

**Grammatical awareness develops unevenly.** Whilst primary learners often acquired substantial receptive vocabulary, their productive grammatical knowledge was frequently limited. Secondary teachers reported that incoming Year 7 learners could often understand and respond to simple French but struggled to construct original sentences independently.

**Motivational trajectories require attention.** Graham documented a phenomenon she terms the **"Year 7 dip"**—a decline in motivation and enjoyment of language learning during the first year of secondary school, even for learners who had enjoyed primary languages. This dip appears related to discontinuity in teaching approaches, repetition of content perceived as already learned, and the more formal, assessment-oriented culture of secondary language classrooms.

### Implications for Curriculum Continuity

Graham's primary-secondary transition research has informed debates about curriculum design and the organisation of language provision across key stages. Her findings suggest that:

- **Transition planning** between primary and secondary schools should address not only content coverage but pedagogical continuity and motivational support
- **Secondary teachers** benefit from understanding what primary learners have experienced and can do, avoiding demotivating repetition
- **Assessment at transition** should capture what learners know and can do, informing differentiated provision in Year 7
- **Primary provision** requires adequate time allocation and teacher expertise to build foundations that genuinely prepare learners for secondary study

This research remains highly relevant as policy discussions continue about the place of languages in primary education and the organisation of the transition to secondary school.

## The Language Magician and Assessment Innovation

### Development of the Assessment Tool

Graham's **Language Magician** project, funded by the European Commission and conducted in collaboration with European partners, built on the Nuffield primary research to create an innovative assessment tool for primary languages classrooms. The project recognised that assessment practices in primary language teaching were often poorly developed, with limited tools available to capture what young learners knew and could do.

The Language Magician is a computer-game-based assessment that evaluates learners' language skills in engaging, low-stakes conditions. It addresses the particular challenges of assessing young learners, who may lack the test-taking experience and emotional regulation to perform well in conventional assessment formats.

### European Collaboration and Adaptability

The European scope of the Language Magician project enabled Graham and her collaborators to develop an assessment framework adaptable across different national contexts. The tool has been implemented in multiple European countries, with versions available for different language combinations.

This work exemplifies Graham's commitment to **practical application** of research findings. Rather than remaining in academic publication, her primary transition research has been translated into tangible tools that teachers can use to understand learner progress and inform instruction.

## Additional Research Contributions

### Reading and Vocabulary Development

Beyond her primary focus on listening, Graham has conducted significant research into **second language reading** and **vocabulary development**. The Nuffield-funded **"Developing the Teaching of Reading in Modern Foreign Languages"** project, led by the University of Oxford with Graham's involvement, investigated whether instruction in phonics and reading strategies could improve progress and motivation for beginner learners of French at secondary school.

This work highlighted the **decoding challenges** facing learners of foreign languages with opaque sound-spelling correspondences (such as French) and demonstrated the value of explicit phonics instruction within communicative language teaching approaches.

### Creativity and Language Learning

Graham led the **Education Strand of Creative Multilingualism**, an interdisciplinary project within the AHRC's Open World Research Initiative. This collaboration with the University of Cambridge explored the impact of using literary and non-literary texts on the motivation and linguistic development of learners of French and German in secondary schools.

The project investigated whether engaging with creative, culturally rich texts could enhance learner motivation and promote deeper language learning than purely functional communicative approaches. Findings suggested that **creative engagement with texts** can indeed support both motivation and linguistic development, particularly when teachers are supported to work with challenging materials.

### Current Research: Digital Empowerment in Language Teaching

Graham's current major project, **Digital Empowerment in Language Teaching (DELTEA)**, funded by the ESRC and led by the University of Southampton in collaboration with Reading, examines the role of technology in foreign language teaching and learning in the primary school (2022-2025).

This research responds to the rapid expansion of digital tools in language education, investigating how technology can support (or hinder) language development, teacher effectiveness, and learner engagement. The project recognises that digital provision in primary language teaching is increasingly prevalent but often undertheorised, with limited evidence to guide implementation decisions.

## Pedagogical Implications for Key Stage 3

### Implications for Listening Instruction

Graham's research generates specific, actionable guidance for Key Stage 3 language teachers:

**Teach listening as a skill, not merely a test.** Listening activities should include explicit attention to the processes of comprehension, not merely checking of answers. Teachers should model strategic thinking, discussing what they anticipate, what they attend to, and how they resolve comprehension difficulties.

**Use pre-listening activities strategically.** Activating prior knowledge, predicting content, and establishing clear purposes for listening prepare learners for successful comprehension and develop their strategic awareness.

**Provide during-listening support.** Rather than playing audio "cold" and testing recall, teachers should design activities that guide learners' attention and scaffold comprehension. This might include focusing attention on specific information, providing partial transcripts, or using visual support.

**Develop metacognitive reflection.** Post-listening activities should include discussion of how learners achieved comprehension (or why they struggled), building awareness of effective strategies that can be transferred to new listening contexts.

**Build listening self-efficacy explicitly.** Teachers should design listening activities that offer progressive challenge with visible success, helping learners develop confidence in their listening abilities alongside actual proficiency.

### Implications for Motivation and Continuation

For sustaining motivation through Key Stage 3 and beyond:

**Attend to attributional messages.** How teachers frame success and failure influences learners' willingness to persist. Attributing success to effort and strategy use, rather than innate ability, supports continued engagement when challenges arise.

**Make progress visible.** Learners often fail to recognise their own improvement. Regular opportunities to review earlier work, chart progress, and reflect on development sustain motivation.

**Address the transition dip.** Year 7 requires particular attention to motivational support as learners adapt to new expectations and teaching approaches. Acknowledging prior learning without boring repetition, establishing supportive classroom relationships, and maintaining engaging pedagogy help navigate this transition.

**Develop strategic competence as motivation.** Teaching learners how to approach language tasks effectively enhances their self-efficacy and motivation simultaneously. Strategy instruction should be viewed as both a cognitive and motivational intervention.

### Implications for Curriculum Design

Graham's research suggests several principles for curriculum design:

**Integrate strategy instruction across the curriculum.** Rather than treating strategies as a separate topic, Graham advocates embedding strategy development within regular language content. Every listening, reading, speaking, and writing activity becomes an opportunity to develop strategic awareness.

**Ensure adequate time and depth.** Coverage-focused curricula that rush through content undermine the depth of engagement necessary for strategy development and motivational sustainability. Graham's research suggests that fewer topics addressed in greater depth may better serve long-term motivation and proficiency.

**Attend to affective dimensions.** Curricula that focus exclusively on linguistic content neglect the motivational and emotional factors that determine whether learners persist. Attention to self-efficacy, anxiety reduction, and intrinsic motivation should be built into curriculum planning.

**Plan across transitions.** The primary-secondary and KS3-GCSE transitions require deliberate planning that addresses content continuity, pedagogical adaptation, and motivational support. Graham's research indicates that poorly managed transitions significantly undermine language participation.

## Common Misconceptions and Challenges

### Misconception: Listening Cannot Be Taught

A persistent misconception in language education is that listening is a passive reception skill that develops naturally through exposure rather than through explicit instruction. Graham's research thoroughly refutes this view, demonstrating that listening involves active strategic processing that can be taught, practised, and developed. The "comprehension approach" that treats listening as testing rather than teaching is not merely ineffective but actively counterproductive, fostering learner anxiety and undermining self-efficacy.

### Challenge: Time Constraints and Curriculum Coverage

Teachers frequently report that explicit strategy instruction requires time they do not have within crowded curricula. Graham's response is that strategy instruction should be integrated within existing activities rather than added as separate content. The pre-listening, during-listening, and post-listening framework does not require additional listening materials but rather a different pedagogical approach to the materials already in use.

Furthermore, Graham argues that time invested in strategy development yields returns in learner independence and proficiency that enable more efficient progress through curriculum content. Learners who possess effective listening strategies comprehend more quickly and accurately, reducing the need for repeated explanation and remediation.

### Misconception: Motivation Is a Fixed Trait

Some educators conceptualise motivation as a stable personality characteristic—some learners are "motivated," others are not. Graham's research demonstrates that motivation is dynamically shaped by educational experience. The same learner may be highly motivated in one context (a supportive classroom with visible progress) and demotivated in another (a high-pressure environment with repeated failure). This insight places responsibility on educational design rather than attributing outcomes to learner characteristics.

## Influence on Policy and Practice

### Impact on Initial Teacher Education

Graham's position as Subject Leader for PGCE Secondary MFL at Reading means her research directly influences the preparation of new language teachers. Her findings about listening pedagogy, strategy instruction, and motivation inform the curriculum of one of England's largest MFL initial teacher education programmes.

This influence extends beyond Reading through publication, conference presentations, and contributions to national subject associations. Graham has served on the National Consortium of Languages Education (NCLE) Research and Innovation Board and the British Academy Language Advisory Group, contributing to national policy discussions.

### Impact on Classroom Practice

Through the Professional Development Consortium and subsequent workshops, Graham's research has reached hundreds of practising teachers. The eight principles developed through the Consortium provide a framework for self-evaluation and professional development that continues to influence classroom practice across England.

The practitioner response articles published in Language Teaching demonstrate how teachers have translated Graham's research into concrete classroom practices—from redesigned listening sequences to revised approaches to learner feedback.

### International Reach

Whilst Graham's research focuses particularly on UK educational contexts, her work has international significance. The Language Magician project's European collaboration, publications in international journals, and invitations to present at international conferences have disseminated her findings to global audiences. The fundamental principles of strategy instruction and the relationship between self-efficacy and motivation have universal applicability across language education contexts.

## Critical Evaluation and Ongoing Debates

### Strengths of the Research Programme

Graham's research exhibits several notable strengths:

**Ecological validity** — Her studies are conducted in real educational settings with authentic learner populations, ensuring findings translate to actual classroom conditions.

**Methodological rigour** — From experimental interventions to longitudinal tracking studies, Graham employs appropriate methodologies to address research questions, with attention to validity and reliability.

**Practical translation** — Unlike research that remains at theoretical or empirical levels, Graham consistently translates findings into actionable guidance for teachers, through principles, frameworks, and professional development materials.

**Sustained focus** — Over three decades, Graham has maintained coherent research themes, building cumulative knowledge about listening, motivation, and transition rather than shifting between disconnected topics.

### Limitations and Critiques

**Contextual specificity** — Much of Graham's research focuses on French language learning in English secondary schools, raising questions about generalisability to other languages, educational phases, or national contexts.

**Implementation challenges** — Whilst Graham's research demonstrates what effective practice looks like, the challenges of implementing strategy-focused pedagogy in under-resourced schools with large class sizes receive less attention.

**Measurement complexities** — Assessing strategic behaviour and motivational constructs presents ongoing methodological challenges. Self-report measures may not capture actual cognitive processes, and behavioural indicators may miss internal strategic activity.

### Future Directions

Graham's current research continues to evolve. The **DELTEA project** addresses the growing role of technology in language education. Emerging interests include:

- **Teacher cognition** — how teachers' beliefs and knowledge shape their implementation of research-informed practices
- **Vocabulary development** — strategies for acquiring and retaining lexical knowledge
- **Inclusion and accessibility** — how strategy instruction can support learners with additional needs

## Conclusion

Suzanne Graham stands as one of the most influential figures in UK language education research. Her sustained investigation of listening comprehension, learner motivation, and educational transition has generated knowledge that fundamentally shapes how teachers understand and enact their practice. Through rigorous empirical research, practical translation, and direct influence on teacher education, Graham has bridged the persistent gap between research and practice in language teaching.

For Key Stage 3 teachers, Graham's work offers a coherent framework for understanding why some learners thrive whilst others struggle, and what pedagogical responses can shift learners from the latter group to the former. The central insight—that strategic competence and self-efficacy are intertwined and teachable—provides a foundation for classroom practice that develops not merely linguistic proficiency but learner independence and sustained motivation.

In an educational context of declining language participation and persistent challenges in learner retention, Graham's research provides evidence-informed pathways for improvement. Her work demonstrates that the decisions educators make about listening instruction, feedback practices, transition planning, and curriculum design have measurable effects on learner outcomes and continuation. These insights place responsibility and opportunity in teachers' hands, offering practical strategies for fostering the linguistic and motivational development that will sustain language learning into the future.
