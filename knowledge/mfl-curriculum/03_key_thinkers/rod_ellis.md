# Rod Ellis: Second Language Acquisition and Task-Based Language Teaching

Rod Ellis is one of the most influential scholars in the field of second language acquisition (SLA) and language pedagogy. His work on task-based language teaching (TBLT) has fundamentally shaped how modern foreign languages are taught in classrooms worldwide, including in UK schools. This knowledge file explores Ellis's key theories, his contributions to understanding how languages are acquired, and the practical implications of his work for MFL teachers.

## Biographical Overview and Academic Contributions

### Career and Influence

Rod Ellis holds the position of Distinguished Professor at Curtin University in Australia and is a visiting professor at Anaheim University. Over a career spanning more than four decades, he has established himself as one of the most cited researchers in the field of second language acquisition, with over 150,000 citations to his work.

Ellis's contribution to the field is characterised by his ability to bridge the gap between theoretical research and classroom practice. Unlike some academics whose work remains purely theoretical, Ellis has consistently sought to translate research findings into practical pedagogical guidance. This has made his work particularly valuable for teachers seeking evidence-based approaches to language instruction.

## Second Language Acquisition Theory

### What is Second Language Acquisition?

Before examining Ellis's specific contributions, it is important to understand what second language acquisition encompasses. SLA is the study of how people learn a language after their first language (mother tongue) has been established. This field investigates the cognitive, social, and linguistic processes involved in learning additional languages.

Ellis characterises SLA as a relatively new field of enquiry. Before the late 1960s, discussions of language learning were primarily adjuncts to language teaching pedagogy, underpinned by behaviourism—the dominant learning theory of that era. Behaviourism viewed language learning as the acquisition of habits through stimulus-response conditioning and reinforcement.

The cognitive revolution in psychology, combined with Chomsky's critique of behaviourism and his theory of universal grammar, led to a fundamental shift in how researchers understood language learning. Ellis's work sits within this cognitive tradition, though he has also incorporated insights from sociocultural theory.

### Ellis's Theoretical Framework

Ellis's approach to SLA is distinguished by several key characteristics:

#### Integration of Cognitive and Social Perspectives

Ellis argues that effective language teaching must draw on both psycholinguistic and sociocultural understandings of how languages are learned. The psycholinguistic approach examines the mental processes involved in language acquisition—how input becomes intake, how attention affects learning, and how implicit and explicit knowledge systems develop. The sociocultural approach, drawing on Vygotsky's work, emphasises the role of social interaction, scaffolding, and collaborative learning.

Ellis maintains that these perspectives are complementary rather than contradictory. Teachers need to understand the cognitive processes that underlie language learning while also creating the social conditions that support these processes.

#### The Implicit-Explicit Knowledge Distinction

One of Ellis's most significant theoretical contributions is his distinction between implicit and explicit language knowledge:

**Implicit knowledge** is tacit, intuitive knowledge that underlies spontaneous language use. It is what native speakers draw upon when they produce language fluently without conscious attention to grammatical rules. Implicit knowledge is procedural—knowing *how*—and is acquired through meaningful exposure to language in use.

**Explicit knowledge** is conscious knowledge of language rules and structures. It is declarative—knowing *that*—and is held in conscious memory. Explicit knowledge can be verbalised and is typically what is taught in traditional grammar instruction.

Ellis argues that both types of knowledge are important for language learners. Implicit knowledge is essential for fluent, automatic language production, while explicit knowledge serves as a monitor that learners can draw upon when they have time to plan and edit their output.

This distinction has profound implications for teaching. It suggests that instruction must do more than simply present grammar rules; it must also create conditions for the development of implicit knowledge through communicative language use.

## Task-Based Language Teaching (TBLT)

### The Shift from PPP to TBLT

Ellis is widely recognised as the leading theorist of task-based language teaching. TBLT represents a fundamental departure from the traditional Present-Practice-Produce (PPP) approach that dominated language teaching for decades.

In the PPP approach:
1. **Present**: The teacher presents a specific grammatical structure
2. **Practice**: Learners practise the structure in controlled exercises
3. **Produce**: Learners use the structure in freer activities

Ellis and other task-based theorists critique this approach on several grounds. PPP assumes that language is acquired through the accumulation of discrete grammatical items, taught sequentially. It prioritises explicit knowledge and controlled practice over communicative language use. Research has consistently shown that the transfer of learning from controlled exercises to spontaneous communication is limited.

TBLT reverses this sequence and reorganises priorities:
1. **Task**: Learners engage in meaningful communicative tasks
2. **Planning/Reporting**: Learners plan and report on their task performance
3. **Language Focus**: Attention is drawn to relevant linguistic features (optional but recommended)

### Defining 'Task'

Central to Ellis's theory is a precise definition of what constitutes a 'task'. For Ellis, a task is:

> "A workplan that requires learners to process language pragmatically in order to achieve an outcome that can be evaluated in terms of whether the correct or appropriate propositional content has been conveyed."

Key characteristics of tasks include:

- **Primary focus on meaning**: The primary goal is to convey meaning and achieve an outcome, not to display linguistic accuracy
- **Gap principle**: Tasks typically involve an information gap, opinion gap, or reasoning gap that creates a communicative need
- **Real-world relevance**: Tasks mirror real-world language use outside the classroom
- **Outcome orientation**: Tasks have a clear, non-linguistic outcome that can be evaluated

Ellis distinguishes between **unfocused tasks** (which elicit general language use without targeting specific structures) and **focused tasks** (which are designed to elicit particular linguistic features while maintaining a primary focus on meaning).

### The Rationale for Task-Based Teaching

Ellis advances several arguments in support of task-based teaching:

#### The Natural Order Hypothesis

Research in SLA has consistently shown that learners acquire grammatical structures in a predictable order that is largely unaffected by instruction. This natural order suggests that teaching grammar sequentially, as in PPP, is inefficient because learners will acquire structures when they are developmentally ready, not when they are taught.

TBLT acknowledges this natural order by prioritising communicative language use over explicit grammar instruction. Grammar is not ignored—Ellis advocates for a "focus on form" approach—but it is addressed reactively in response to learner needs rather than proactively in a predetermined sequence.

#### The Importance of Comprehensible Output

While comprehensible input (Krashen's focus) is necessary for acquisition, Ellis argues that output is equally important. Producing language pushes learners to process language more deeply, to notice gaps in their knowledge, and to test hypotheses about the target language.

Tasks create the need for output. When learners engage in meaningful communication, they must draw upon and develop their linguistic resources in ways that controlled exercises do not require.

#### The Role of Interaction

Ellis emphasises the importance of interaction in language development. When learners engage in tasks, they negotiate meaning, provide feedback to each other, and collaboratively construct understanding. This interaction creates what Long called the "interactional modifications" that facilitate acquisition.

Research has shown that the quality of interaction during task performance is a significant predictor of learning outcomes. Tasks that require substantial negotiation of meaning tend to be more effective than those that do not.

### Designing Task-Based Courses

In his 2003 article "Designing a Task-Based Syllabus," Ellis presents a framework for developing task-based curricula. This framework addresses several key decisions:

#### Selecting Tasks

Tasks should be selected based on:
- **Relevance** to learners' needs and interests
- **Complexity** appropriate to learners' proficiency level
- **Diversity** to ensure coverage of different language functions and contexts
- **Engagement** to maintain learner motivation

#### Sequencing Tasks

Ellis proposes several criteria for sequencing tasks within a course:
- **Complexity**: Beginning with simpler tasks and progressing to more complex ones
- **Familiarity**: Starting with tasks involving familiar content before introducing unfamiliar topics
- **Processing demands**: Considering the cognitive demands of tasks
- **Language demands**: Gradually increasing the linguistic complexity required

#### Integrating Focus on Form

Ellis argues that TBLT should include attention to linguistic form, but this attention should be:
- **Reactive** rather than preemptive—responding to errors that emerge during task performance
- **Brief**—not interrupting the flow of communication
- **Relevant**—addressing forms that learners are ready to acquire

This "focus on form" can occur during task performance (through corrective feedback) or after task completion (through analysis of task recordings or texts).

## Ellis's Principles of Instructed Language Learning

In his seminal 2005 article, Ellis proposed ten principles for instructed language learning based on SLA research. These principles synthesise research findings into practical guidance for teachers:

### Principle 1: Instruction Needs to Ensure that Learners Develop Both a Rich Repertoire of Formulaic Expressions and a Rule-Based Competence

Native speakers use both formulaic expressions (chunks of language stored and retrieved as wholes) and rule-based competence (grammatical knowledge). Instruction must address both. Formulaic expressions provide the building blocks of fluency, while rule-based competence enables creative language use.

### Principle 2: Instruction Needs to Ensure that Learners Focus Predominantly on Meaning

While attention to form is necessary, the primary focus of instruction should be on meaning and communication. This principle supports the task-based approach, where meaning is primary.

### Principle 3: Instruction Needs to Ensure that Learners Also Focus on Form

Despite Principle 2, explicit attention to form is necessary for the development of grammatical competence. The challenge is to integrate focus on form without losing the primacy of meaning.

### Principle 4: Instruction Needs to Be Predominantly Directed at Developing Implicit Knowledge of the L2 While Not Neglecting Explicit Knowledge

Implicit knowledge is essential for fluent, spontaneous language use. Explicit knowledge has a supporting role but should not be the primary goal of instruction.

### Principle 5: Instruction Needs to Take into Account the Learner's "Built-In Syllabus"

Learners follow a natural developmental sequence. Instruction is most effective when it aligns with this sequence rather than attempting to impose an external grammatical syllabus.

### Principle 6: Successful Instructed Language Learning Requires Extensive L2 Input

Learners need massive exposure to the target language. Instruction must provide abundant comprehensible input.

### Principle 7: Successful Instructed Language Learning Also Requires Opportunities for Output

Learners need to produce language. Tasks provide these opportunities and push learners to develop their linguistic resources.

### Principle 8: The Opportunity to Interact in the L2 Is Central to Developing L2 Proficiency

Interaction facilitates acquisition through negotiation of meaning, feedback, and collaborative construction of language.

### Principle 9: Instruction Needs to Take Account of Individual Differences in Learners

Learners vary in their motivation, aptitude, learning styles, and prior knowledge. Effective instruction accommodates this variation.

### Principle 10: Instructed Language Learning Needs to Assess Both Implicit and Explicit Knowledge

Assessment should measure what learners can do with language, not just what they know about language. Task-based assessment is therefore essential.

These principles provide a research-based framework for language teaching that aligns with the recommendations of the Ofsted Research Review: Languages (2021) and the Teaching Schools Council MFL Pedagogy Review (2016).

## Implications for UK MFL Teaching

### Alignment with National Curriculum and Ofsted

Ellis's work has significant implications for MFL teaching in UK schools:

#### The National Curriculum for Languages

The National Curriculum for Languages at Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3 emphasises communication, interaction, and real-world language use. These priorities align closely with task-based principles. The curriculum's focus on "practical communication" rather than grammatical knowledge reflects the TBLT approach that Ellis advocates.

#### The Ofsted Research Review: Languages (2021)

The Ofsted research review drew extensively on SLA research, including Ellis's work. Key recommendations that align with Ellis's principles include:

- Prioritising extensive exposure to the target language
- Ensuring that pupils have regular opportunities to use the language meaningfully
- Teaching grammar explicitly but within a communicative context
- Building pupils' confidence through successful task completion

The review explicitly notes that "pupils need regular opportunities to use the language in ways that are authentic and purposeful"—a core tenet of task-based teaching.

#### The TSC MFL Pedagogy Review (2016)

The Teaching Schools Council's Modern Foreign Languages Pedagogy Review, which informed the National Centre for Excellence in Language Pedagogy (NCELP) approach, incorporated insights from Ellis's work. The review's emphasis on "practical communicative competence" and its critique of grammar-translation approaches echo Ellis's arguments for task-based teaching.

### Implementing Task-Based Teaching in UK Classrooms

Translating Ellis's theories into classroom practice requires careful consideration of the UK context:

#### Class Size and Time Constraints

UK MFL classes are often large, and contact time is limited. Ellis acknowledges that task-based teaching requires careful management of classroom dynamics. Pair work and group work are essential, but teachers need strategies for ensuring that all pupils are engaged and that interaction is productive.

#### Mixed-Ability Classes

UK comprehensive schools typically have mixed-ability classes. Ellis's approach accommodates this through the principle that tasks can be performed at different levels of sophistication. The same task can challenge advanced learners while remaining accessible to less proficient pupils.

#### Examination Requirements

GCSE and A-Level examinations assess specific grammatical content, which might seem to conflict with the task-based emphasis on natural acquisition. Ellis argues that TBLT can prepare learners for examinations more effectively than grammar-focused instruction because it develops the implicit knowledge that underlies fluent performance.

### Practical Applications

Based on Ellis's work, UK MFL teachers might:

- **Begin lessons with tasks** rather than grammar presentations
- **Use information-gap activities** that create genuine communicative needs
- **Provide feedback on form** during or after task performance, not before
- **Include task repetition** to allow learners to incorporate feedback and improve performance
- **Assess through tasks** that require meaningful communication rather than discrete-point grammar tests

## Critiques and Debates

### Criticisms of TBLT

Ellis's advocacy for task-based teaching has not gone unchallenged. Critics have raised several concerns:

#### The Role of Explicit Grammar Instruction

Some educators argue that TBLT underemphasises explicit grammar instruction, particularly for learners whose first language is very different from the target language. While Ellis acknowledges the importance of focus on form, critics suggest this may be insufficient for learners who need explicit metalinguistic knowledge.

#### Classroom Management Challenges

Task-based teaching requires significant changes to classroom dynamics. Teachers accustomed to controlling the content and sequence of lessons may find the less predictable nature of TBLT challenging.

#### Assessment Alignment

Traditional assessment often focuses on discrete grammatical points that are easily tested. Task-based assessment, which Ellis advocates, requires different approaches that may be less familiar to teachers and examination boards.

### Ellis's Responses

Ellis has responded to these critiques in various publications. He acknowledges that TBLT is not a panacea and that effective implementation requires teacher development and institutional support. He argues that while explicit grammar instruction has a role, it should not dominate the curriculum. He also notes that assessment practices need to evolve to align with task-based approaches.

## Conclusion

Rod Ellis has made an unparalleled contribution to our understanding of how languages are learned and how they should be taught. His work on task-based language teaching has provided a theoretical foundation and practical framework for communicative language instruction that aligns with contemporary understanding of second language acquisition.

For UK MFL teachers, Ellis's work offers evidence-based principles for curriculum design, classroom practice, and assessment. The alignment between his principles and the recommendations of Ofsted and the Teaching Schools Council makes his work particularly relevant for teachers seeking to implement effective, research-informed language teaching.

Understanding Ellis's theories enables teachers to:
- Design lessons that promote genuine communication
- Create conditions for the development of implicit language knowledge
- Integrate attention to form without losing focus on meaning
- Assess language proficiency through meaningful tasks
- Support learners in developing both fluency and accuracy

As the field of SLA continues to evolve, Ellis's work remains a touchstone for researchers and practitioners alike. His ability to translate complex research into accessible principles for teaching has made him one of the most influential figures in language education worldwide.
