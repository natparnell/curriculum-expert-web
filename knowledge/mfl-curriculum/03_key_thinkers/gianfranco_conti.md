# Gianfranco Conti: Key Thinker Profile

## Biography and Academic Background

Dr Gianfranco Conti is one of the most influential voices in modern foreign languages (MFL) pedagogy in the United Kingdom and internationally. An applied linguist with nearly three decades of classroom experience, Conti has emerged as a leading advocate for evidence-informed language teaching that bridges the gap between second language acquisition research and practical classroom application.

### Academic Credentials

Conti holds an impressive portfolio of qualifications that underpin his expertise in both linguistics and pedagogy:

- **PhD in Applied Linguistics** — His doctoral research into Second Language Acquisition (SLA) forms the foundation of his Extensive Processing Instruction (EPI) approach
- **MA in TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language)** — Providing grounding in language teaching methodology
- **MA in English Literature** — Contributing to his deep understanding of textual analysis and language use
- **PGCE in Modern Languages and Physical Education** — His initial teacher training qualification

### Professional Experience

Conti's professional career spans multiple continents and educational contexts. He has taught French, Spanish, Italian, and English for over 20 years across primary and secondary phases. As of recent years, he has been based at Garden International School in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he continues to teach Spanish and French whilst developing his pedagogical frameworks and training materials.

### The Language Gym

In addition to his classroom teaching, Conti is the founder, owner, and Chief Executive Officer of **The Language Gym** (language-gym.com), widely regarded as one of the leading language learning websites globally. The platform serves as both a resource hub for language learners and a professional development space for MFL teachers seeking to implement evidence-based approaches. Through The Language Gym, Conti disseminates research summaries, practical teaching activities, and theoretical frameworks that have influenced thousands of educators worldwide.

## Extensive Processing Instruction (EPI)

At the heart of Conti's contribution to MFL pedagogy lies **Extensive Processing Instruction (EPI)**, an approach that emerged directly from his PhD research into Second Language Acquisition and skill-acquisition theory. EPI represents a fundamental reconceptualisation of how languages are taught in classrooms, challenging conventional communicative language teaching methodologies that have dominated UK MFL since the 1980s.

### Theoretical Foundations

EPI is grounded in several well-established research traditions:

**Usage-Based Linguistics**: Conti draws on Michael Tomasello's work on construction grammar and usage-based theories of language acquisition, which emphasise that language learning occurs through exposure to meaningful input and the extraction of patterns from that input, rather than through explicit grammar instruction alone.

**Skill Acquisition Theory**: Following the work of researchers such as Anderson, DeKeyser, and Johnson, EPI recognises that language learning involves the transformation of declarative knowledge (knowing *that*) into procedural knowledge (knowing *how*) through extensive practice and automatisation.

**Cognitive Load Theory**: Conti's approach acknowledges the limited capacity of working memory and structures instruction to manage cognitive load effectively, ensuring that learners can process new language without overwhelming their mental resources.

**Input Processing**: Drawing on Bill VanPatten's research, EPI prioritises how learners process input, recognising that comprehension precedes production and that extensive exposure to comprehensible input is essential for acquisition.

### Core Principles of EPI

Conti articulates several non-negotiable principles that define the EPI approach:

1. **Teach Less, Not More**: Rather than covering extensive vocabulary lists and grammar points superficially, EPI advocates deep exploration of a narrower range of high-frequency, generative language chunks that can be recombined flexibly.

2. **Input Before Output**: Learners must receive extensive exposure to target language in meaningful contexts before being expected to produce it spontaneously. This reverses the typical classroom pattern where production is demanded too early.

3. **Focus on Lexicogrammatical Chunks**: Language is taught as prefabricated chunks (collocations, sentence stems, discourse markers) rather than isolated words or decontextualised grammar rules. These chunks serve as the building blocks of fluent production.

4. **Extensive Processing**: Learners engage in multiple cycles of processing the same language chunks through varied activities, ensuring deep encoding and robust retrieval pathways.

5. **Delayed Output**: Spontaneous production is the final stage of learning, not the starting point. Teachers must resist the pressure to have students speaking from lesson one.

## The MARS EARS Framework

The practical implementation of EPI is structured through Conti's **MARS EARS** instructional sequence, a pedagogical framework that guides teachers from initial input to fluent, spontaneous production. This eight-stage sequence is designed to convert input into output through principled, research-informed stages that respect the cognitive demands of language learning.

### MARS — The Input Phase

The first four stages focus on establishing receptive knowledge and controlled production:

#### M — Modelling

**Purpose**: Provide rich, meaning-bearing exposure to target language chunks in relevant contexts.

**Key Activities**:
- **Sentence Builders**: Visual displays showing sentence frames with interchangeable elements (e.g., "Je voudrais + [food item] + parce que + [opinion]"). These serve as the central organisational tool for each unit of work.
- **Narrow Input**: Texts, audio, and video materials that recycle the same chunks repeatedly in varied contexts.
- **Visual Support**: Images, gestures, and realia that make meaning transparent without resorting to English translation.

**Teacher Role**: The teacher models pronunciation, intonation, and usage, ensuring that learners receive accurate, natural-sounding input at a pace that allows processing.

#### A — Awareness-Raising

**Purpose**: Help learners notice patterns and regularities within the chunks they have encountered.

**Key Activities**:
- **Pattern Spotting**: Guiding learners to identify grammatical regularities (e.g., noticing that adjectives follow nouns in French, or recognising verb conjugation patterns).
- **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing target language structures with English equivalents.
- **Metalinguistic Discussion**: Brief, focused discussions about how the language works, avoiding lengthy grammar explanations.

**Conti's Clarification**: Conti emphasises that this phase should be "short and snappy" — the goal is to sensitise learners to patterns, not to deliver comprehensive grammar instruction. Explicit grammar teaching comes later, after learners have processed the chunks extensively.

#### R — Receptive Processing

**Purpose**: Develop deep processing of target language through intensive listening and reading activities that require discrimination and manipulation of chunks.

**Key Activities**:
- **Listening Tasks**: Activities such as "Read My Mind" (guessing the teacher's sentence from clues), "True/False" statements, and dictation exercises that require careful listening.
- **Reading Tasks**: Narrow reading texts that recycle target chunks, accompanied by comprehension questions, gap-fills, and matching activities.
- **Translation Exercises**: Controversially for some, Conti advocates controlled translation exercises as a means of checking comprehension and reinforcing form-meaning connections.

**Principle**: Learners must demonstrate understanding before moving to production. This phase typically involves the greatest volume of activity in an EPI unit.

#### S — Structured Production

**Purpose**: Scaffolded writing and speaking practice that supports accurate output whilst minimising cognitive load.

**Key Activities**:
- **Sentence Builder Manipulation**: Learners create sentences using the sentence builder as a scaffold, gradually reducing reliance on visual support.
- **Gap-Fill and Substitution Drills**: Controlled exercises that require learners to manipulate chunks in predictable ways.
- **Scaffolded Speaking**: Activities such as "Find Someone Who" (though Conti acknowledges this can feel like "fake speaking" if not carefully structured), sentence races, and paired repetition exercises.

**Critical Distinction**: This is *structured* production, not spontaneous production. Learners are still working with provided chunks and scaffolds. Spontaneity comes later.

### EARS — The Output Phase

The second four stages focus on developing autonomy, fluency, and spontaneous use:

#### E — Expansion

**Purpose**: Extend learners' ability to use chunks creatively and flexibly beyond the original models.

**Key Activities**:
- **Creative Combination**: Tasks requiring learners to combine known chunks in novel ways.
- **Personalisation**: Activities where learners adapt chunks to express their own meanings and experiences.
- **Elaboration**: Extending simple sentences into more complex constructions by adding detail, opinion, or justification.

#### A — Autonomy

**Purpose**: Develop learner independence by reducing scaffolding and increasing self-regulation.

**Key Activities**:
- **Independence from Sentence Builders**: Gradually removing visual supports so learners retrieve chunks from memory.
- **Self-Correction**: Encouraging learners to monitor and correct their own output.
- **Strategic Planning**: Tasks where learners plan what they want to say before speaking, managing their own linguistic resources.

#### R — Routinisation

**Purpose**: Build fluency through extensive practice that automatises retrieval and production of chunks.

**Key Activities**:
- **Speed Activities**: Timed tasks that push learners to produce language more quickly.
- **Repetition and Recycling**: Multiple encounters with the same chunks across different task types.
- **Fluency Lines**: Organised speaking activities where learners practise the same exchange repeatedly with different partners.

**Theoretical Basis**: Following DeKeyser's work on automatisation, Conti recognises that fluency develops only through extensive, accurate practice that gradually reduces the cognitive effort required for production.

#### S — Spontaneity

**Purpose**: Enable genuine, unplanned communication where learners select and deploy language independently.

**Key Activities**:
- **Open-Ended Tasks**: Information-gap activities, role-plays, and discussions where the specific language used is not predetermined.
- **Improvisation**: Activities requiring learners to respond to unexpected questions or situations.
- **Transfer Tasks**: Using learned chunks in entirely new contexts and for new communicative purposes.

**Conti's Warning**: Many teachers attempt spontaneous production too early, before learners have the linguistic resources or fluency to communicate effectively. Premature demands for spontaneity lead to anxiety, code-switching, and fossilisation of errors.

## Key Publications

Conti has co-authored several influential handbooks with Steve Smith, another highly respected MFL educator and former head of languages in UK secondary schools. Their collaboration represents a powerful combination of academic research and practical classroom experience.

### The Language Teacher Toolkit (2016; 2nd Edition 2023)

This comprehensive handbook provides MFL teachers with a wealth of "instantly usable classroom strategies and ideas." Covering lesson planning, teaching the four skills, grammar instruction, vocabulary teaching, and assessment, the book serves as a practical manual for teachers at all career stages. The second edition (2023) includes updated research, new activities, and refined approaches based on feedback from the extensive EPI teacher community.

### Breaking the Sound Barrier: Teaching Language Learners How to Listen (2019)

Perhaps Conti's most influential work, this book addresses what he identifies as a critical weakness in MFL pedagogy: the neglect of listening skills. Conti argues that listening is typically treated as a test of comprehension rather than a skill to be taught, with teachers playing recordings and asking questions without providing learners with the strategies or practice needed to become effective listeners.

The book provides:
- A theoretical framework for understanding listening as a complex cognitive skill
- Practical techniques for developing bottom-up (decoding) and top-down (inferencing) listening abilities
- A comprehensive set of classroom activities for teaching listening at different proficiency levels
- Guidance on selecting and adapting authentic listening materials

### Memory: What Every Language Teacher Should Know (2021)

Drawing on cognitive psychology and memory research, this book explores how understanding memory processes can transform language teaching. Conti examines working memory limitations, the spacing effect, retrieval practice, and interleaving, providing practical strategies for designing curricula and lessons that optimise memory encoding and retention.

## Critiques and Debates

Conti's work has generated significant discussion within the MFL community, reflecting broader tensions in language teaching methodology.

### The Debate Over Communicative Language Teaching

EPI represents a direct challenge to the communicative approach that has dominated UK MFL since the National Curriculum was introduced. Conti argues that the dogmatic insistence on immediate target language use and spontaneous communication has failed generations of learners, producing students who can perform rehearsed role-plays but cannot actually communicate effectively.

This critique has been controversial. Some teachers and researchers defend communicative approaches, arguing that:
- Early production builds confidence and motivation
- The affective filter is lowered when students can express themselves
- Authentic communication is the ultimate goal of language learning

Conti's response is that premature production builds *false* confidence based on rehearsed scripts, and that the cognitive demands of spontaneous production before adequate input and practice actually *raise* anxiety and inhibit acquisition.

### Translation and Explicit Grammar

Conti's advocacy of translation exercises and explicit grammar instruction places him at odds with both communicative orthodoxy and more radically input-oriented approaches such as Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling (TPRS).

Whilst he maintains that input must come first, Conti argues that:
- Controlled translation is an efficient means of checking comprehension
- Explicit grammar knowledge supports noticing and monitoring
- English has a legitimate role in the MFL classroom when used strategically

This moderate position — neither grammar-translation nor pure comprehensible input — has found favour with many UK teachers who recognise the limitations of both extremes.

### Commercialisation and Teacher Training

As EPI has grown in popularity, Conti has developed a significant training and consultancy business, offering courses, resources, and school support packages through The Language Gym and partner organisations such as Network for Learning. Some critics have questioned whether the approach has become overly commercialised, with schools investing in training and resources that promise transformation.

Conti's defenders point to the extensive free materials available on his website and blog, and the fact that the core principles of EPI can be implemented without purchasing any commercial products.

## Implementation in UK Schools

### Adoption Patterns

EPI has been adopted most widely in UK secondary schools, particularly at Key Stage 3, where the pressure of examination specifications is less intense and teachers have greater freedom to experiment with curriculum design. The approach has been particularly popular in:

- Schools seeking to address poor uptake and outcomes at GCSE
- Departments with strong professional development cultures
- Schools with curriculum leaders open to evidence-informed innovation
- Multi-academy trusts investing in systematic curriculum development

### Practical Challenges

Teachers implementing EPI report several common challenges:

**Resource Development**: Creating the narrow input texts, sentence builders, and activities required for EPI is time-consuming. Whilst Conti provides templates and examples, departments must invest significant time in developing materials matched to their specific contexts.

**Student and Parent Expectations**: Students and parents accustomed to communicative classrooms may initially resist an approach that delays speaking and emphasises listening and reading. Clear communication about the rationale and expected outcomes is essential.

**Assessment Alignment**: GCSE specifications and examination formats do not always align neatly with EPI principles. Teachers must ensure that whilst developing long-term proficiency, students also acquire the specific skills and formats required for examination success.

**Primary Transition**: The transition from primary MFL (where provision is often sporadic and methods vary widely) to secondary EPI programmes can be challenging. Conti has increasingly focused on primary-adapted approaches, but the discontinuity remains an issue.

### Success Factors

Schools reporting successful EPI implementation typically share several characteristics:

- **Whole-Department Adoption**: EPI is most effective when all teachers in a department use consistent approaches, resources, and terminology.
- **Sustained Professional Development**: One-off training sessions are insufficient; teachers need ongoing support as they develop their practice.
- **Leadership Support**: Middle leaders need time, resources, and autonomy to implement curriculum change.
- **Realistic Timescales**: Proficiency improvements take years to manifest; departments must resist pressure for immediate results.

## Connection to the National Curriculum

Conti's approach aligns with several aspects of the National Curriculum for Languages (2013) whilst challenging others.

### Alignment

**Depth Over Breadth**: The National Curriculum's emphasis on "understanding and responding to spoken and written language" and "speaking with increasing confidence, fluency and spontaneity" supports EPI's focus on thorough processing before production.

**Grammar Understanding**: The requirement that pupils "understand basic grammar appropriate to the language being studied" aligns with EPI's awareness-raising and explicit grammar phases.

**Cultural Understanding**: EPI's use of authentic texts and cultural contexts supports the National Curriculum's aim that pupils "appreciate stories, songs, poems and rhymes in the language."

### Tension

**Spontaneity Expectations**: The National Curriculum's expectation that pupils should "speak with increasing confidence, fluency and spontaneity" from Key Stage 2 onwards arguably conflicts with EPI's recognition that genuine spontaneity is a late-acquired skill. Conti would argue that the curriculum confuses rehearsed performance with spontaneous communication.

## Summary and Significance

Dr Gianfranco Conti represents a significant influence on contemporary MFL pedagogy in the United Kingdom. Through his Extensive Processing Instruction approach and the practical MARS EARS framework, he has provided teachers with a research-informed alternative to communicative language teaching that addresses many of the shortcomings that have plagued UK MFL for decades.

His emphasis on extensive input, delayed output, and the systematic development of fluency through automatisation offers a coherent theoretical basis for curriculum design. The practical resources and professional development materials developed through The Language Gym have enabled widespread adoption, making evidence-informed practice accessible to teachers without extensive academic backgrounds in applied linguistics.

Critics may question aspects of his approach — the commercial dimensions, the departure from communicative orthodoxy
