# MFL Department Leadership: Curriculum Ownership, CPD and Quality Assurance

## Introduction

Effective leadership of a Modern Foreign Languages (MFL) department requires a distinctive blend of subject expertise, pedagogical knowledge, and systems thinking that addresses the unique challenges facing language education in England. The head of MFL occupies a pivotal position between senior leadership strategic vision and classroom practice, translating whole-school priorities into coherent departmental action whilst advocating for the specific needs of language learners and their teachers.

This knowledge file examines the multifaceted role of MFL department leadership, drawing on insights from professional bodies such as the Association for Language Learning (ALL), the National Centre for Excellence for Language Pedagogy (NCELP), and Ofsted's framework for subject deep dives. It explores how heads of department establish curriculum ownership, design effective continuing professional development (CPD), implement quality assurance systems, and cultivate teacher expertise within their teams.

## The Distinctive Nature of MFL Leadership

### Subject-Specific Leadership Challenges

MFL leadership presents particular challenges that distinguish it from other subject areas. Unlike mathematics or English, where most teachers possess confident subject knowledge from their own schooling, many primary teachers and some secondary colleagues approach MFL teaching with anxiety about their own linguistic competence (Barnes, 2015; Jones and Coffey, 2017). This creates a leadership imperative to build confidence alongside competence, fostering what Michael Wardle HMI, Ofsted's subject lead for languages, describes as "a culture where all teachers feel empowered to deliver effective language instruction regardless of their starting point."

The peripheral status historically accorded to MFL within the curriculum compound these challenges. Research by Board and Tinsley (2014) found that without effective and enthusiastic leadership, MFL risks being viewed as "a low-status, peripheral extra for students" rather than a core entitlement. The head of department must therefore function as both operational manager and subject ambassador, continuously articulating the value of language learning to students, parents, and senior leaders.

### The Middle Leadership Position

As Quarterdeck (2026) observes, middle leaders including department heads "translate senior leadership direction into classroom reality." For MFL, this translation work involves interpreting whole-school priorities—whether literacy across the curriculum, metacognitive strategies, or assessment reforms—through a language-specific lens. The effective head of MFL does not merely implement generic initiatives but adapts them to serve the distinctive goals of language education: developing oracy, fostering intercultural understanding, and building the automaticity that underpins communicative competence.

This mediating role requires sophisticated professional knowledge. The head of department must understand both the statutory framework (the National Curriculum Programmes of Study, GCSE subject content requirements) and the pedagogical research base that informs effective practice. Crucially, they must also possess the interpersonal skills to develop these understandings across diverse teams that may include native speakers, specialist linguists, and non-specialist teachers—particularly in primary settings where MFL is often taught by generalist practitioners.

## Curriculum Ownership and Vision

### Establishing a Coherent Departmental Curriculum

Curriculum ownership in MFL begins with clarity about what students should know and be able to do at each stage of their language learning journey. The 2016 MFL Pedagogy Review, chaired by Ian Bauckham, identified three pillars of effective language teaching: phonics, vocabulary, and grammar. Heads of department must ensure these pillars inform curriculum design from early years through to GCSE and beyond, creating a coherent progression that builds systematically rather than recycling superficially.

The National Centre for Excellence for Language Pedagogy (NCELP) has developed curriculum resources that exemplify this principled approach. Their schemes of work demonstrate how language can be taught through a "language-driven pedagogy" that prioritises high-frequency vocabulary, systematic phonics instruction, and carefully sequenced grammar—moving away from the topic-based approaches that characterised earlier generations of MFL teaching. For department leaders, adopting or adapting such resources requires more than administrative decision-making; it demands the pedagogical expertise to evaluate evidence-based approaches and the leadership skill to secure team buy-in for potentially significant change.

### Curriculum Cohesion Across Key Stages

A critical aspect of curriculum ownership is ensuring coherence across the transition points that punctuate a student's language education. The Primary Languages Network (PLN) emphasises that "the requirements for the DfE KS2 Languages PoS must be woven into the primary curriculum in creative and innovative ways"—but this weaving requires careful coordination between phase leaders.

Effective heads of department establish clear expectations about what students should know by the end of each key stage, creating assessment frameworks that inform teaching rather than merely measuring it. This includes addressing the particular challenges of transition from primary to secondary, where research consistently shows that progress stalls as students encounter repetitive or mismatched content. The head of department who takes genuine ownership of curriculum progression will work proactively with feeder primaries or receiving secondaries to ensure continuity, rather than accepting the discontinuities that plague language education.

### Resourcing and Implementation

Curriculum ownership extends to the practical business of resource allocation. The Head of Languages Handbook published by ALL (2019) notes that department leaders must manage budgets strategically, investing in resources that support the agreed curriculum vision rather than accumulating disconnected materials. This includes decisions about textbook adoption, subscription services, authentic materials, and technology—each evaluated against their contribution to the department's pedagogical goals.

Implementation of the curriculum requires ongoing monitoring and adjustment. Kate May, a head of languages who documented her Ofsted deep dive experience, describes how she "implemented and adapted" the E.P.I. (Extensive Processing Instruction) approach in her department, managing the change process through careful CPD, modelling, and collaborative planning. This adaptive implementation—responding to departmental context whilst maintaining fidelity to evidence-based principles—represents curriculum ownership in action.

## Continuing Professional Development (CPD)

### Building a Culture of Professional Learning

The 2016 MFL Pedagogy Review identified weak subject-specific CPD as a significant barrier to improving language teaching. Heads of department are uniquely positioned to address this deficit, creating departmental cultures where continuous professional learning is normalised and supported. As Learning Cultures (2022) observes, effective subject leadership involves "delivering a consistent message... solutions involving all staff and learners" through professional learning that builds "subject and conceptual expertise and excellent pedagogy."

This culture-building work begins with the head of department's own engagement with professional learning. The ALL Network for Learning offers CPD specifically designed for language subject leaders, emphasising that such development "enables delegates to develop thinking in key areas of subject leadership." By modelling their own commitment to professional growth—whether through engagement with NCELP resources, attendance at subject association conferences, or participation in research-informed practice—heads of department establish expectations that permeate their teams.

### Designing Effective Departmental CPD

Effective departmental CPD in MFL is distinguished by its subject specificity. Generic whole-school training, whilst valuable for certain purposes, cannot address the particular knowledge and skills required for effective language teaching. Research by Taylor (2024) on professional development leadership found that secondary heads of MFL often feel that mandated CPD "tends to feel a little bit more like a staff meeting than staff development"—highlighting the frustration experienced when departmental needs are subordinated to whole-school priorities.

The head of department who takes CPD seriously will design a programme that:

- **Builds linguistic confidence**: For primary teachers and non-specialists, this may include language upskilling opportunities, access to native speaker support, or structured schemes that reduce the burden of generating target language.
- **Develops pedagogical expertise**: Drawing on resources such as the NCELP CPD courses, which provide "an unparalleled opportunity for teachers to develop a comprehensive understanding of the 2016 Modern Foreign Languages Pedagogy Review recommendations."
- **Addresses specific departmental needs**: Using gained time productively for team development, focusing on areas identified through quality assurance processes such as challenge, differentiation, or target language use.
- **Creates space for reflection and trialling**: The most effective CPD, as noted by practitioners engaged with NCELP, is "split into different sessions, allowing for reflection time and space to trial ideas between them."

### Cascading and Embedding Learning

For CPD to impact student outcomes, learning must be cascaded beyond those who attend initial training and embedded in sustained changes to practice. NCELP's CPD courses are explicitly designed for "Heads of Department or others in a leadership position that enables them to cascade course content to MFL colleagues in their school, trust or region." This cascading requires careful planning: heads of department must internalise new approaches deeply enough to model them convincingly, anticipate implementation challenges, and support colleagues through the awkward early stages of changed practice.

Embedding also requires systems that sustain new approaches over time. This may include collaborative planning sessions where teachers work together to adapt resources, peer observation focused on specific pedagogical techniques, or departmental meetings structured around professional learning rather than administrative updates. The head of department who views CPD as an event (a training day, a conference attendance) will see limited impact; the leader who treats it as an ongoing process of collective improvement will generate sustained change.

## Quality Assurance

### Purposeful Monitoring and Evaluation

Quality assurance in MFL departments serves developmental rather than merely accountability purposes. Whilst heads of department are accountable for outcomes, effective quality assurance systems prioritise understanding and improving the processes that generate those outcomes. This distinction matters because excessive focus on data can distract from the pedagogical realities that determine whether students actually learn languages effectively.

Michael Wardle HMI's guidance on languages in outstanding primary schools emphasises that inspectors examine "the quality of education a school provides" through deep dives into subject-specific practice. For department leaders, this means developing monitoring systems that capture the distinctive features of language teaching: the extent of target language use, the quality of oral interaction, the systematic teaching of phonics, vocabulary, and grammar, and the development of intercultural understanding.

### Lesson Observation and Feedback

Lesson observation remains a key quality assurance tool, but its effectiveness depends on the expertise of the observer and the quality of feedback provided. For MFL, observation requires particular subject knowledge: the observer must understand what effective language teaching looks like, recognising that "a class where students speak a lot is not 'easy'—it is doing the core work of language learning" (Conti, 2025).

Effective heads of department design observation protocols that:
- Focus on specific, agreed priorities derived from departmental development plans
- Involve teachers in self-assessment before external observation
- Provide feedback that is specific, actionable, and developmental
- Include follow-up support to help teachers embed recommendations

The European Centre for Modern Languages' QualiTraining guide emphasises the importance of developing "a culture of quality" through systematic self-assessment, observation, and collaborative review—approaches that build professional responsibility rather than dependency.

### Work Scrutiny and Assessment Quality

Examining student work provides insight into curriculum implementation and assessment validity. In MFL, work scrutiny should examine:
- The range and accuracy of vocabulary encountered
- Progression in grammatical understanding and application
- Development of phonological awareness and pronunciation
- Quality of written and spoken output over time
- Response to feedback and evidence of redrafting

Heads of department must ensure that assessment practices generate useful information without creating excessive workload. This includes moderating internally to secure consistency, calibrating assessments against external standards (particularly at GCSE), and using assessment information to inform teaching rather than merely to report attainment.

### Student Voice and Stakeholder Engagement

Quality assurance extends to gathering the perspectives of those experiencing the curriculum. Student voice activities in MFL might explore:
- Perceptions of progress and what has helped them learn
- Confidence in using the language for communication
- Views on the relevance and interest of curriculum content
- Experience of feedback and assessment

Engaging parents and carers is also important, particularly given the anxieties that can surround language learning. Clear communication about curriculum aims, ways to support at home (even for non-speakers of the language), and celebration of achievement all contribute to a supportive environment for language learning.

## Developing Teacher Expertise

### Recognising and Building on Strengths

Every MFL department contains diverse expertise. The effective head of department maps this expertise, recognising who has strengths in which areas and deploying these strategically. As Everyday MFL advises, heads should ask: "Who in your department is good at challenge, differentiation, target language use?" These individuals become informal mentors, CPD leaders, or resource developers—multiplying their impact across the team.

Expertise development also involves identifying and addressing gaps. For primary settings, where MFL may be taught by generalists with limited language background, this includes providing structured support that enables confident delivery without requiring unrealistic levels of linguistic mastery. For secondary settings, it may involve deepening subject knowledge for early-career teachers or broadening pedagogical repertoire for experienced practitioners.

### Supporting Non-Specialist and Early-Career Teachers

The challenge of teaching MFL without specialist expertise is particularly acute in primary schools. Research by Legg (2013) found that teacher confidence—not just competence—is paramount for effective MFL provision. Heads of department (or subject coordinators, in primary settings) must therefore create conditions where non-specialists feel supported rather than exposed.

This support includes:
- High-quality schemes of work that reduce planning burden whilst maintaining pedagogical integrity
- Audio and video resources that model correct pronunciation
- Opportunities to observe specialist practitioners
- Collaborative teaching arrangements where possible
- Clear guidance on what matters most (e.g., phonics, high-frequency vocabulary) versus what is less critical

For early-career teachers, whether specialist or not, structured support is essential. This includes mentoring focused on the specific challenges of MFL teaching, protected time for reflection and planning, and gradual increases in responsibility as expertise develops.

### Professional Learning Communities

Beyond individual development, heads of department foster collective expertise through professional learning communities. These may take various forms: regular departmental meetings focused on pedagogical improvement, cross-school networks (such as those coordinated by teaching school hubs or subject associations), or participation in research projects.

The Primary Languages Network exemplifies this approach, bringing together "QTS qualified primary languages teachers and trainers who also teach primary languages in over 50 schools" to share practice and develop collective expertise. For heads of department, investing time in such networks pays dividends: access to resources, solutions to common challenges, and the morale boost of working with colleagues who understand the specific demands of language teaching.

## Leading Through Change

### Managing Curriculum Reform

MFL departments have experienced significant curriculum reform in recent years, including the revised GCSE subject content that places greater emphasis on phonics, vocabulary breadth, and grammatical accuracy. Heads of department must lead their teams through these changes, translating abstract policy requirements into practical classroom approaches.

Joe Fincham, Head of Department and NCELP Course Leader, reflected on how his department's adoption of NCELP pedagogy "facilitated a positive outcome" in their Ofsted deep dive. This success story illustrates the importance of evidence-informed change management: understanding the research base, accessing high-quality CPD, and systematically implementing new approaches with appropriate support.

### Responding to Accountability Pressures

The Ofsted deep dive process represents a particular accountability pressure for MFL departments. As one head of languages documented, deep dives involve detailed exploration of "what happened, what questions I was asked, how I answered and what evidence I provided." Preparation requires clarity about curriculum intent, implementation, and impact; confidence in explaining pedagogical choices; and well-organised evidence of student progression.

However, effective heads of department resist the temptation to create performative systems designed merely to satisfy inspectors. Instead, they ensure that accountability processes serve genuine improvement purposes—so that preparation for inspection represents honest communication about effective practice rather than artificial manufacture of evidence.

## Conclusion

Leadership of an MFL department demands a sophisticated combination of subject expertise, pedagogical knowledge, and interpersonal skill. The head of department who exercises effective curriculum ownership, designs purposeful CPD, implements developmental quality assurance, and cultivates teacher expertise creates the conditions in which language learning can flourish.

In the current educational climate, with languages facing particular challenges around uptake and achievement, this leadership work is more important than ever. The head of department who can articulate a compelling vision for language education, build confident and capable teams, and secure the resources and time necessary for effective teaching makes a distinctive contribution to their school and—ultimately—to their students' life chances in an interconnected world.

The evidence reviewed in this knowledge file points to several key principles for effective MFL department leadership:

1. **Subject specificity matters**: Generic approaches to leadership, CPD, and quality assurance fail to address the distinctive challenges of language teaching. Effective leaders maintain focus on what makes MFL unique.

2. **Confidence is as important as competence**: Particularly for non-specialists and primary colleagues, building confidence to teach languages is essential. This requires supportive systems and appropriate resources.

3. **Evidence-informed practice**: Drawing on research such as the 2016 MFL Pedagogy Review and resources from NCELP enables departments to move beyond tradition or intuition towards approaches with proven effectiveness.

4. **Collaborative development**: Expertise grows through collective professional learning. Effective heads of department foster cultures where teachers learn together, supported by external networks and subject associations.

5. **Systematic implementation**: Vision without implementation is merely aspiration. Quality assurance systems ensure that agreed approaches are consistently enacted and continuously improved.

By attending to these principles, heads of MFL departments can fulfil their crucial role in ensuring that all students have access to high-quality language education—regardless of their starting point or the structural challenges facing the subject.
