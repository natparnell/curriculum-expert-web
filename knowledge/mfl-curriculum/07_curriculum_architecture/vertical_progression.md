# Vertical Progression in Modern Foreign Languages

## Overview

Vertical progression in Modern Foreign Languages (MFL) refers to the deliberate, cumulative design of the curriculum that enables pupils to build knowledge and skills systematically from their first encounters with a foreign language in Key Stage 2 through to advanced study at A-level and beyond. The Department for Education's National Curriculum for Languages (2014) established the framework for this progression, while Ofsted's subject review for languages (2023) emphasised the critical importance of curriculum coherence and the avoidance of the "arbitrary accumulation of vocabulary or structures without purpose or connection."

Effective vertical progression in MFL is built upon three interconnected pillars: phonics, vocabulary, and grammar. These pillars provide the foundation for all subsequent language learning, enabling pupils to understand how the language works, decode new language, and express themselves with increasing sophistication. The challenge for curriculum designers lies not merely in covering more content at each key stage, but in ensuring that each element of the curriculum builds logically upon what has come before, creating a coherent narrative of increasing linguistic competence.

## The Three Pillars of Progression

### Phonics: The Foundation of Decoding

Phonics in MFL provides pupils with the knowledge required to decode written language and produce accurate spoken language. Unlike English, where sound-spelling correspondences are notoriously irregular, major European languages taught in UK schools (French, German, Spanish, Italian) have more systematic phonics systems. This regularity is both an opportunity and a responsibility: pupils can achieve relatively rapid success in reading and pronunciation, but only if phonics is taught explicitly and systematically.

**Key Stage 2 Foundation:**
In primary MFL, phonics should be introduced through systematic exposure to sound-spelling relationships. Pupils learn to recognise grapheme-phoneme correspondences that differ from English (such as French nasal vowels, Spanish rolled /r/, or German umlauts). The emphasis should be on accurate pronunciation and decoding rather than linguistic analysis.

**Key Stage 3 Development:**
At Key Stage 3, phonics knowledge is consolidated and extended. Pupils learn to recognise patterns across word families and apply their phonics knowledge to decode unfamiliar vocabulary. They also develop awareness of phonological features such as liaison in French, vowel harmony in German, and stress patterns in Spanish. This knowledge enables increasingly independent engagement with authentic texts.

**Key Stage 4 and Beyond:**
At GCSE and A-level, phonics knowledge supports engagement with complex texts and the production of nuanced spoken language. Pupils develop awareness of regional variation and register, understanding that phonological choices convey social meaning. The ability to decode unfamiliar words using phonics knowledge becomes essential for coping with unseen texts and spontaneous speech.

### Vocabulary: Building the Lexical Architecture

Vocabulary acquisition in MFL follows a progression from high-frequency, concrete vocabulary toward increasingly abstract and specialised terms. The National Curriculum requires pupils to "broaden their vocabulary and develop their ability to understand new words that are introduced into familiar written material."

**High-Frequency Core (KS2-KS3):**
The foundation of the MFL vocabulary curriculum consists of the most frequently occurring words in the target language. Research on word frequency (such as the Routledge Frequency Dictionaries) indicates that knowledge of the 2,000 most frequent word families enables comprehension of approximately 80% of spoken and written text. These high-frequency items should be prioritised in the early stages of learning, with systematic recycling and retrieval practice.

**Thematic Vocabulary Expansion:**
As pupils progress, vocabulary is organised thematically while maintaining connections to the high-frequency core. Personal identification, family and relationships, daily life, and local environment provide accessible contexts for vocabulary expansion in the early stages. At Key Stage 3 and beyond, themes become more abstract: education and employment, the media, social issues, global concerns.

**Tiered Vocabulary Approach:**
Effective vocabulary progression recognises three tiers of vocabulary:

- **Tier 1:** High-frequency words that appear across all contexts (core verbs, basic adjectives, common nouns)
- **Tier 2:** Academic vocabulary that appears across curriculum subjects but requires explicit teaching (verbs of cognition, abstract nouns, discourse markers)
- **Tier 3:** Domain-specific vocabulary tied to particular topics (specialised terminology for environmental issues, literary analysis, etc.)

Progression involves systematic attention to all three tiers, with particular care given to Tier 2 vocabulary that enables academic language use.

**Word Formation and Derivation:**
Advanced vocabulary development includes understanding word formation processes. Pupils learn to recognise prefixes, suffixes, and cognates that enable them to deduce the meaning of unfamiliar words. This morphological awareness is particularly powerful in Romance languages (French, Spanish, Italian) where Latin roots connect to English academic vocabulary.

### Grammar: The Architecture of the Language

Grammar provides the structural framework that enables pupils to construct meaning. The 2014 National Curriculum requires pupils to "understand basic grammar appropriate to the language being studied," including key features and patterns, and to "apply this understanding to build sentences and express meaning."

**Foundational Grammar (KS2):**
In primary MFL, grammar is introduced implicitly through patterns and chunks. Pupils learn formulaic phrases ("Je m'appelle...", "Me llamo...") and begin to notice patterns in how words change (gender agreement with articles and adjectives, verb endings for different subjects). The emphasis is on accurate use within familiar contexts rather than explicit metalinguistic analysis.

**Systematic Grammar Development (KS3):**
Key Stage 3 marks the transition to more explicit grammar instruction. Pupils learn to manipulate verbs across a widening range of tenses (present, perfect, near future at minimum; additional tenses for higher-attaining pupils). They develop understanding of sentence structure, including subordination and the use of conjunctions to connect clauses. Key grammatical concepts include:

- **Gender and agreement:** Understanding that nouns have grammatical gender and that articles, adjectives, and pronouns must agree
- **Verb conjugation:** Recognising person, number, tense, and mood through verb endings
- **Case systems:** In German, developing understanding of nominative, accusative, and dative cases and their functions
- **Word order:** Understanding that different languages follow different rules for constituent order

**Complex Grammar (KS4 and Beyond):**
GCSE requires use of multiple time frames, extended sentences, and a range of structures. A-level demands sophisticated control of complex grammatical features including the subjunctive, passive voice, and advanced clause structures. Progression from KS3 to KS5 involves not merely learning new grammatical features but developing increasing fluency and accuracy in their application.

## Threshold Concepts in MFL

Threshold concepts represent transformative ideas that, once understood, enable pupils to see the subject in a new way. Meyer and Land's framework for threshold concepts has been applied to language learning to identify the conceptual gateways that enable progression.

### The Concept of Grammatical Gender

For English-speaking pupils, the concept that nouns have grammatical gender represents a significant threshold. This is not merely a matter of learning which nouns are masculine or feminine (or neuter in German), but understanding that gender is a grammatical category that affects agreement across the noun phrase and determines pronoun reference. Crossing this threshold enables pupils to produce accurate language and understand why apparently redundant features (such as gender-specific articles) are essential to meaning.

### The Concept of Verb Conjugation

Understanding that verb endings change systematically to indicate person, number, tense, and mood transforms pupils from users of fixed phrases to generators of original sentences. This threshold concept underpins the move from formulaic production to creative language use. Pupils who grasp conjugation understand that "je parle", "tu parles", "il parle" are not separate lexical items but inflections of a single verb, and that this pattern applies across the verbal system.

### The Concept of Register and Appropriateness

Language varies according to context, audience, and purpose. Understanding that there is no single "correct" form of the language, but rather appropriate choices for different situations, represents a significant threshold. This concept enables pupils to move beyond seeking "the" translation and toward understanding how language choice constructs social meaning. It underpins the ability to use formal and informal registers appropriately and to understand the social dimensions of language use.

### The Concept of Intercomprehension

Advanced language learners develop the understanding that languages exist in relationship with one another. Knowledge of one Romance language facilitates comprehension of others; awareness of cognates and shared etymology enables educated guessing. This threshold concept transforms language learning from an isolated activity to one that draws upon and reinforces broader linguistic knowledge.

## Key Stage Progression

### Key Stage 2: Foundations (Ages 7-11)

The statutory requirement for MFL at Key Stage 2 is that pupils should "develop an appreciation of a variety of writing in the language studied." While not all primary schools offer sustained MFL programmes, those that do provide a crucial foundation for secondary study.

**Curriculum Content:**
- Exposure to the sound system of the language through songs, rhymes, and simple spoken language
- Learning formulaic phrases for personal identification and basic communication
- Introduction to the writing system and basic decoding
- Development of intercultural awareness and positive attitudes toward language learning

**Pedagogical Approach:**
Primary MFL should emphasise enjoyment, confidence-building, and the development of positive dispositions. The focus is on listening and speaking, with reading and writing introduced gradually. Multi-sensory approaches, including songs, games, and physical responses, support engagement and memory.

**Transition Considerations:**
The transition from KS2 to KS3 is widely recognised as problematic in MFL. Pupils may arrive with highly variable prior knowledge, ranging from no formal language study to several years of sustained teaching. Secondary curricula must be designed to accommodate this variability, identifying and building upon prior learning without assuming it.

### Key Stage 3: Consolidation and Extension (Ages 11-14)

Key Stage 3 represents the critical period for establishing secure foundations in MFL. The National Curriculum specifies that pupils should "understand and respond to spoken and written language from a variety of authentic sources" and "speak with increasing confidence, fluency and spontaneity."

**Curriculum Content:**
- Systematic development of phonics, vocabulary, and grammar knowledge
- Expansion of topic coverage to include education, leisure, and the local area
- Development of transactional and interactional competence
- Introduction to authentic texts appropriate to the age group
- Foundation for GCSE topics and skills

**Pedagogical Approach:**
Effective KS3 MFL combines explicit instruction in language systems with meaningful communicative practice. The emphasis should be on developing the ability to manipulate language for genuine communication rather than merely reproducing rehearsed phrases. Regular retrieval practice supports long-term retention of vocabulary and grammatical structures.

**Threshold Concept Development:**
KS3 is when most pupils encounter and must cross the threshold concepts of grammatical gender, verb conjugation, and agreement. Explicit teaching, with clear explanation and extensive practice, supports this conceptual development. Teachers should anticipate and address common misconceptions (such as assuming word order follows English patterns or that cognates always have identical meanings).

### Key Stage 4: GCSE Preparation (Ages 14-16)

GCSE specifications in MFL require pupils to develop competence across three themes: Identity and Culture; Local, National, International and Global Areas of Interest; and Current and Future Study and Employment. Assessment covers listening, speaking, reading, and writing, with tiered entry (Foundation and Higher) for most components.

**Curriculum Content:**
- Comprehensive coverage of GCSE specification themes and topics
- Development of strategies for coping with unfamiliar language in receptive skills
- Expansion of productive competence to include narration, description, and simple argumentation
- Use of multiple time frames and a range of grammatical structures
- Development of exam technique and assessment literacy

**Pedagogical Approach:**
While GCSE preparation inevitably involves attention to assessment requirements, effective teaching maintains a focus on genuine communication and language development. The specification themes provide contexts for language use rather than ends in themselves. Teaching should ensure that pupils can apply their knowledge flexibly rather than relying on rehearsed responses.

**Progression Considerations:**
The shift from KS3 to GCSE involves increased linguistic and cognitive demand. Pupils must move from producing language within familiar, rehearsed contexts to coping with unprepared questions and unseen texts. This transition requires careful scaffolding, with gradually increasing challenge in the materials used and the tasks set.

### Key Stage 5: Advanced Study (Ages 16-18)

A-level MFL represents a significant step up in cognitive and linguistic demand. Specifications require engagement with sophisticated authentic materials, including literary texts and films, and the development of analytical and critical skills through the target language.

**Curriculum Content:**
- In-depth study of topical issues, artistic culture, and aspects of political life
- Detailed analysis of literary texts and/or films in the target language
- Development of research skills for the individual research project
- Sophisticated grammatical control, including complex structures and registers
- Development of translation skills (English to target language and vice versa)

**Pedagogical Approach:**
A-level teaching bridges the gap between school study and university-level language work. There is increased emphasis on independent study, with pupils expected to engage with authentic materials beyond the classroom. Teaching develops critical thinking and analytical skills, with language used as the medium for intellectual exploration.

**Progression to Higher Education:**
A-level MFL prepares students for degree-level language study and for language use in professional contexts. The ability to engage with complex texts, express nuanced opinions, and translate accurately provides a foundation for advanced study and employment.

## Cumulative Curriculum Design

### The Logic of Cumulative Learning

A cumulative curriculum is one in which new learning builds systematically upon prior learning, with regular opportunities to revisit and consolidate earlier material. In MFL, this means that the vocabulary, grammar, and phonics introduced at one stage are reinforced and extended at subsequent stages, with new material integrated into a growing network of knowledge.

Ofsted's subject review (2023) identified that the strongest MFL curricula "plan backwards from the end points, ensuring that pupils learn the knowledge they need in a logical order." This requires curriculum designers to identify the knowledge and skills required at GCSE and A-level, then map backwards to ensure that foundational knowledge is established at earlier stages.

### Spacing and Interleaving

Cognitive science research supports the use of spacing (distributing practice over time) and interleaving (mixing different topics and skills) to support long-term retention. In MFL, this means:

- **Vocabulary recycling:** High-frequency vocabulary introduced in Year 7 should reappear regularly throughout the curriculum, not merely within the unit where it is first taught
- **Grammar revisiting:** Grammatical structures should be revisited in new contexts, with increasing complexity, rather than taught once and presumed mastered
- **Skill integration:** Listening, speaking, reading, and writing should be developed in combination rather than as isolated skills

### Retrieval Practice

Retrieval practice—deliberately recalling information from memory—strengthens retention more effectively than merely reviewing material. MFL curricula should incorporate regular retrieval practice, including:

- Low-stakes testing of vocabulary and grammar
- Dictation and transcription activities that require accurate recall
- Speaking tasks that require pupils to generate language without reference to notes
- Translation activities that require manipulation of previously learned structures

### The Role of Formative Assessment

Formative assessment plays a crucial role in cumulative curriculum design by identifying gaps in learning and informing responsive teaching. In MFL, effective formative assessment:

- Checks understanding of phonics, vocabulary, and grammar systematically
- Identifies misconceptions that might impede future learning
- Provides feedback that enables pupils to improve
- Informs decisions about when to move on and when to consolidate

## Common Progression Pitfalls

### The Vocabulary Accumulation Trap

A common error in MFL curriculum design is to treat progression as merely the accumulation of more vocabulary. Pupils are introduced to ever-growing lists of words without the grammatical structures to use them or the strategies to remember them. This approach leads to superficial coverage and rapid forgetting.

Effective vocabulary progression requires:
- Careful selection of high-frequency and high-utility items
- Systematic recycling and retrieval practice
- Integration with grammatical structures that enable productive use
- Development of word-learning strategies (cognate recognition, morphological awareness)

### The Grammar-Translation Fallacy

While explicit grammar instruction is essential, over-reliance on grammar-translation methods can impede development of communicative competence. Pupils may become proficient at analysing language without being able to use it for genuine communication.

Effective grammar progression requires:
- Explicit explanation of grammatical concepts
- Extensive practice in meaningful contexts
- Development of automaticity through repeated use
- Connection to communicative purposes

### The KS2-KS3 Disconnect

As noted above, the transition between primary and secondary MFL is frequently problematic. Secondary teachers may assume either too much or too little prior knowledge, leading to repetition (and pupil disengagement) or inappropriate challenge (and pupil failure).

Effective transition requires:
- Clear communication between primary and secondary phases
- Robust assessment of incoming pupils' knowledge
- Flexible curriculum design that can accommodate variable starting points
- Building upon prior learning rather than starting from scratch

### The GCSE-A Level Gap

The transition from GCSE to A-level MFL represents a significant jump in demand. Some pupils who have succeeded at GCSE through memorisation and rehearsal struggle with the independence and analytical demands of A-level.

Effective progression requires:
- Development of independent study skills at GCSE
- Exposure to authentic materials and unprepared tasks
- Gradual introduction of analytical and critical thinking
- Explicit preparation for the demands of advanced study

## Assessment and Progression

### National Curriculum Assessment

At Key Stage 2, MFL is not subject to statutory assessment. Schools should use their own assessment systems to track progress against the National Curriculum programmes of study.

At Key Stage 3, schools arefree to determine their own assessment approaches. Progress should be assessed against the National Curriculum objectives, with particular attention to the three pillars of phonics, vocabulary, and grammar.

At Key Stage 4, GCSE specifications provide detailed assessment frameworks. The 9-1 grading system recognises achievement across a broad range, with Grade 4 representing a "standard pass" and Grade 5 a "strong pass" equivalent to the former Grade C. Higher grades (7-9) require sophisticated language use, including extended responses, multiple time frames, and a range of grammatical structures.

### Assessment for Learning

Assessment for Learning (AfL) strategies support progression by providing ongoing feedback that enables pupils to improve. In MFL, effective AfL includes:

- **Diagnostic assessment at transition points:** Identifying what pupils know when they arrive from primary school or begin GCSE/A-level courses
- **Peer and self-assessment:** Developing pupils' ability to evaluate their own work and that of their peers against clear criteria
- **Success criteria:** Making explicit what pupils need to do to succeed in speaking, writing, listening, and reading tasks
- **Responsive teaching:** Using assessment information to adjust teaching to address identified gaps or misconceptions

### Data and Progress Tracking

While data can support progression monitoring, Ofsted's subject review cautioned against excessive focus on tracking systems at the expense of curriculum quality. Effective use of assessment data in MFL involves:

- Identifying patterns of strength and weakness across classes or year groups
- Monitoring the progress of specific groups (disadvantaged pupils, SEND, EAL)
- Evaluating the effectiveness of curriculum sequences and pedagogical approaches
- Informing professional development priorities

## The Role of Culture and Intercultural Understanding

### Cultural Knowledge as Progression

While the primary focus of MFL is linguistic competence, cultural knowledge represents an important dimension of progression. The National Curriculum requires pupils to "appreciate stories, songs, poems and rhymes in the language" and to "broaden their vocabulary and develop their ability to understand new words."

Progression in cultural understanding involves:

**Awareness (KS2-KS3):** Recognition of cultural practices, customs, and traditions in countries where the target language is spoken. Pupils learn about everyday life, festivals, food, and traditions.

**Understanding (KS3-KS4):** Deeper comprehension of the historical, social, and geographical contexts that shape culture. Pupils engage with authentic cultural products (films, literature, music) and begin to understand cultural references.

**Critical Engagement (KS5+):** Analysis of cultural products and practices, recognition of diversity within target language communities, and understanding of cultural representation and stereotyping.

### Integration of Culture and Language

Effective MFL teaching integrates cultural and linguistic learning, recognising that language and culture are inseparable. This integration supports progression by:

- Providing meaningful contexts for language use
- Increasing motivation through engagement with authentic materials
- Developing cultural capital that supports future study and employment
- Preparing pupils for interaction with speakers of the target language

### Authentic Materials and Texts

Progression in MFL involves increasing engagement with authentic materials—texts created for native speakers rather than for language learners. The use of authentic materials:

- Exposes pupils to language as it is actually used
- Develops strategies for coping with unfamiliar vocabulary and structures
- Builds cultural knowledge alongside linguistic competence
- Prepares pupils for real-world language use

At Key Stage 3, authentic materials should be carefully selected and adapted to ensure accessibility. By Key Stage 4, pupils should engage with unadapted materials appropriate to their level. At A-level, extensive engagement with sophisticated authentic texts (literature, film, journalism) is central to the curriculum.

## Inclusion and SEND in MFL Progression

### MFL for All Pupils

The National Curriculum states that teachers should "set high expectations for every pupil" and "plan stretching work for pupils whose attainment is significantly above the expected standard" while providing appropriate support for those who are struggling. This applies equally to MFL.

Research indicates that pupils with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) can succeed in MFL when provided with appropriate support. However, there is a persistent tendency to excuse pupils with SEND from language study, particularly at Key Stage 4. This can limit future opportunities and represents a form of low expectations.

### Supporting Slower Progression

Pupils may progress more slowly than their peers for a variety of reasons, including cognitive difficulties, limited prior knowledge, or gaps in English literacy that affect MFL learning. Support strategies include:

- **Pre-teaching:** Introducing vocabulary and concepts before whole-class teaching
- **Additional practice:** Providing extra opportunities for repetition and consolidation
- **Multi-sensory approaches:** Using visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic strategies to support memory
- **Structured support:** Using writing frames, sentence builders, and graphic organisers
- **Assistive technology:** Using text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and other technologies to reduce barriers

### Stretching High Attainers

High-attaining pupils in MFL require appropriate challenge to ensure continued progression. Strategies include:

- **Extension tasks:** Providing more complex texts, more demanding questions, and opportunities for creative production
- **Wider reading:** Encouraging engagement with authentic materials beyond the curriculum
- **Linguistic analysis:** Developing metalinguistic awareness through explicit analysis of language patterns
- **Cultural depth:** Exploring cultural topics in greater depth and with greater critical sophistication
- **Additional languages:** Supporting pupils who wish to study more than one language

### English as an Additional Language (EAL)

Pupils with EAL bring valuable linguistic knowledge and skills to MFL. Their experience of learning English provides metacognitive awareness of language learning strategies. EAL pupils often:

- Understand grammatical concepts (tense, gender, agreement) more readily than monolingual peers
- Are comfortable with code-switching and translanguaging
- Have strategies for coping with unfamiliar language
- Bring knowledge of other languages that may be cognate with the target language

EAL pupils should be supported to transfer their language learning skills to MFL while recognising the value of their multilingual repertoires.

## Curriculum Implementation: Sequencing Principles

### Backward Design

Effective curriculum sequencing in MFL begins with the end in mind. Curriculum designers should:

1. Identify the knowledge and skills required at the end of each key stage (GCSE, A-level)
2. Map backwards to identify the prerequisites for this endpoint knowledge
3. Sequence content logically, ensuring foundational knowledge precedes dependent knowledge
4. Build in regular consolidation and retrieval opportunities

### The Role of Topics and Themes

Topics and themes provide contexts for language learning but should not drive curriculum design. The risk of topic-based curricula is that they encourage the accumulation of isolated vocabulary sets without the grammatical structures to use them flexibly.

Effective topic selection:
- Provides meaningful contexts for language use
- Recycles high-frequency vocabulary and grammar across multiple topics
- Progresses from concrete, immediate topics to abstract, distant ones
- Maintains coherence across the curriculum rather than treating each topic as isolated

### Grammar Sequencing

While there is no single "correct" order for introducing grammatical structures, effective sequencing considers:

- **Frequency:** High-frequency structures (present tense, articles, adjectives) should be introduced early
- **Utility:** Structures that enable pupils to say more (modal verbs, conjunctions) should be prioritised
- **Complexity:** Less complex structures should precede more complex ones, though complexity is not always intuitive (the perfect tense is often more accessible than the simple future)
- **Dependency:** Structures that depend upon prior knowledge (subjunctive after expressions of doubt) should be sequenced accordingly

### Vocabulary Selection

Vocabulary selection should be principled rather than arbitrary. Considerations include:

- **Frequency:** The most frequently occurring words should be prioritised
- **Utility:** Words that enable expression across contexts should be favoured over highly specific terms
- **Cognates:** Words that are similar to English (or other languages pupils know) can support early success
- **Personal relevance:** Words that enable pupils to talk about themselves and their interests increase motivation
- **Accessibility:** Concrete, imageable words are more easily learned than abstract ones

## Professional Development for Progression

### Teacher Subject Knowledge

Effective progression requires teachers to have secure subject knowledge—not only of the target language but of language pedagogy and linguistics. Professional development priorities include:

- Understanding of the target language phonological, lexical, and grammatical systems
- Knowledge of second language acquisition research and its implications for teaching
- Awareness of common learner errors and misconceptions
- Understanding of progression across all key stages, not just those being taught

### Curriculum Literacy

Teachers should understand the principles of effective curriculum design, including:

- How curriculum sequencing supports long-term learning
- The role of retrieval practice and spacing in retention
- How to identify and address misconceptions
- How to use assessment to inform teaching

### Transition Knowledge

Given the importance of transitions in MFL progression, teachers benefit from understanding:

- What is taught in primary MFL and how it prepares pupils for secondary study
- The demands of GCSE and A-level specifications and how KS3 prepares pupils for them
- Common difficulties pupils experience at transition points and how to address them

## Monitoring and Evaluating Progression

### Quality Assurance

Schools should have systems for monitoring the quality of curriculum implementation and its impact on progression. This includes:

- Regular review of curriculum sequencing and resources
- Observation of teaching with a focus on curriculum delivery
- Analysis of pupil work to evaluate the quality of learning
- Review of assessment data to identify patterns of strength and weakness

### External Benchmarking

Schools can use external benchmarks to evaluate their curriculum:

- GCSE and A-level results compared to national averages and similar schools
- Uptake of languages at GCSE and A-level as an indicator of engagement
- Performance of specific groups (disadvantaged, SEND, EAL)
- Comparison with curricula in high-performing schools and Multi-Academy Trusts

### Continuous Improvement

Curriculum design is an ongoing process. Schools should:

- Regularly review and update curriculum content and sequencing
- Respond to changes in specifications, research, and best practice
- Learn from internal and external evaluation
- Invest in professional development to support curriculum implementation

## Conclusion

Vertical progression in Modern Foreign Languages is not a matter of covering more content, but of ensuring that each element of the curriculum builds systematically upon what has come before. The three pillars—phonics, vocabulary, and grammar—provide the foundation for all language learning, enabling pupils to decode language, build meaningful utterances, and engage with increasingly complex texts.

Effective progression requires careful curriculum design that:
- Sequences content logically from foundational knowledge to advanced application
- Builds in regular consolidation and retrieval practice
- Supports pupils in crossing threshold concepts that transform their understanding
- Addresses transition points carefully to ensure continuity
- Includes all pupils, with appropriate support and challenge
- Integrates cultural and linguistic learning
- Uses assessment to inform teaching and monitor progress

The goal of MFL education is not merely to prepare pupils for examinations, but to develop confident, competent linguists who can communicate effectively in the target language and appreciate the cultures where it is spoken. A well-designed, cumulative curriculum that ensures secure progression at each stage provides the foundation for this ambition, opening doors to further study, employment, and life enriched by language competence.

By attending to the principles of vertical progression outlined in this knowledge base—pillar development, threshold concepts, cumulative design, and inclusive practice—curriculum leaders and teachers can ensure that their MFL provision enables every pupil to make strong progress and develop lasting linguistic competence.
