# Motivation and Uptake in MFL

Understanding what drives pupils to continue—or abandon—modern foreign language study is essential for curriculum leaders seeking to reverse the well-documented decline in MFL uptake across England. This knowledge file examines the psychological, institutional, and social factors that shape pupil motivation, from self-concept and perceived success through to the options process and parental influence.

## The Current Context: MFL Uptake in Decline

### National Picture

The decline in MFL participation represents one of the most significant challenges facing language education in England. British Council Language Trends surveys consistently reveal that fewer than half of GCSE students in state schools study a modern foreign language, with stark disparities between affluent and disadvantaged areas. Students at the most affluent state schools are more than 20 percentage points more likely to take a language GCSE than their peers in less advantaged contexts.

The Education Policy Institute (2024) identifies multiple interconnected factors behind this decline: the rise of "Global English"—the perception that English is sufficiently universal to render foreign language learning unnecessary; the design of the Progress 8 accountability measure, which unlike the EBacc does not require a foreign language; and persistent issues around pupil motivation and self-concept in language learning.

### The EBacc and Policy Tensions

The English Baccalaureate (EBacc) was introduced with the ambition that 90% of pupils would study the full suite of core academic subjects, including a modern foreign language. However, this target remains distant. Research published in the *Journal of Education Policy* (2024) characterises the relationship between EBacc and Progress 8 as a "policy tug of war," where the flexibility of Progress 8 allows schools to perform well without requiring language study, undermining EBacc uptake goals.

Ofsted's subject review of MFL (2023) found that low expectations and insufficient continuing professional development (CPD) for language teachers were directly affecting uptake. Inspectors observed that in nearly half of MFL classes, pupils were not learning enough, with two-fifths of observed lessons failing to secure adequate progress. These findings illuminate how classroom-level factors compound systemic challenges.

## Pupil Self-Concept in Language Learning

### Defining Self-Concept in the MFL Context

Self-concept in language learning refers to pupils' beliefs about their own capabilities, characteristics, and potential as language learners. It encompasses not merely linguistic competence but broader identity constructs: whether they see themselves as "good at languages," whether they feel comfortable speaking in front of others, and whether they envisage a future self who uses foreign languages authentically.

Research employing Self-Determination Theory, as explored in *The Language Learning Journal* (2024), demonstrates that motivation increases during the primary-to-secondary transition as pupils begin formal language study. However, this initial enthusiasm often wanes as pupils encounter the cognitive demands of language learning and develop perceptions about their relative standing compared to peers.

### The Role of Self-Efficacy

Self-efficacy—the belief in one's ability to succeed in specific situations—represents a critical subcomponent of self-concept with particular relevance to MFL. Ofsted's review highlights that pupils' self-efficacy consistently predicts academic achievement more strongly than other motivational factors and directly improves language proficiency outcomes.

Self-efficacy in MFL is domain-specific. A pupil may have high self-efficacy for reading comprehension yet low self-efficacy for spontaneous speaking. Teachers should recognise these nuances and design assessment and feedback systems that build efficacy across all four skills (listening, speaking, reading, writing) rather than allowing weakness in one domain to undermine global self-concept.

### Gender and Self-Concept

British Council research documents consistent gender differences in MFL self-concept and participation. Boys' entry and attainment rates in language subjects remain consistently below those of girls, with these patterns established early in secondary schooling. The drivers are complex, encompassing societal stereotypes about language learning as feminine, peer influence, and differences in willingness to risk oral participation where errors are publicly visible.

Effective MFL pedagogy addresses these dynamics by ensuring diverse role models, framing language learning in ways that appeal to varied interests, and creating classroom environments where all pupils feel safe to experiment with new language. Curriculum leaders should audit their language provision for unconscious bias in examples, topics, and classroom interaction patterns.

## Perceived Success and Progress

### Objective Versus Perceived Progress

A crucial finding from longitudinal motivation research is that motivational changes are closely related to *perceived* progress in language learning, not merely objective measures of attainment. Pupils who believe they are improving remain motivated; those who perceive stagnation or decline, regardless of actual attainment, are at risk of disengagement.

This insight has significant implications for assessment and feedback practices. Traditional assessment systems that provide only summative grades may fail to communicate progress effectively. Pupils who receive a grade 5 at two successive assessment points may perceive no progress, even if their underlying proficiency has substantially developed. Progress-focused assessment that explicitly tracks and communicates development across specific competencies helps maintain motivation.

### The Visibility of Progress

Language learning presents unique challenges for making progress visible. Unlike subjects where understanding can be represented through diagrams, models, or extended written responses, much language learning occurs as incremental refinement of implicit knowledge. Pupils may not recognise their own growing ability to comprehend authentic texts or produce more accurate spontaneous speech.

Effective practice involves:

- **Baseline and checkpoint assessments** that demonstrate explicitly how far pupils have progressed
- **Portfolio approaches** that capture pupil work across time, making development visible
- **Can-do statements** that articulate progression in functional, pupil-accessible terms
- **Comprehensible input metrics** showing pupils they can understand progressively more complex authentic materials

### Attribution Patterns

How pupils attribute their successes and failures profoundly affects motivation. Pupils who attribute success to effort and strategy use (unstable, controllable factors) maintain motivation through difficulty. Those who attribute success to innate ability (stable, uncontrollable) or luck (unstable, uncontrollable) are vulnerable to helplessness when challenges arise.

MFL teaching should explicitly develop productive attribution patterns by:
- Praising effort and specific strategies rather than innate ability
- Normalising difficulty as inherent to language learning
- Sharing stories of successful language learners who overcame initial struggles
- Teaching metacognitive strategies so pupils have controllable factors to attribute success to

## The Options Process: Critical Decision Points

### When Decisions Are Made

The options process, typically occurring in Year 9, represents the critical decision point for MFL uptake. However, research suggests that many pupils' decisions are effectively made long before the formal options process through accumulated experiences that shape self-concept and motivation.

The options process itself is influenced by multiple factors beyond pupil preference:
- School policy (whether MFL is compulsory, recommended, or optional)
- EBacc requirements and how these are communicated to pupils and parents
- Timetabling constraints and option block structures
- Teacher recommendations and predicted grades
- Peer influence and friendship group dynamics

### School Policy Variations

School policies regarding MFL at Key Stage 4 vary considerably. Some schools maintain compulsory MFL for all or most pupils; others have made languages optional following the removal of compulsory MFL in 2004. Policy decisions at institutional level are shaped by accountability pressures, staffing capacity, and beliefs about what serves pupils best.

Ofsted (2023) warned that too many pupils receive only two years of MFL at Key Stage 3, effectively ending their language education before the options process. Schools where MFL provision terminates after Year 8—or where early entry patterns compress learning—deny pupils the opportunity to develop sufficient proficiency and self-efficacy to choose languages positively at options.

### Communicating Value

How schools communicate the value of MFL during the options process significantly influences uptake. Where languages are framed merely as EBacc compliance or university entrance requirements, pupils may perceive them as extrinsic obligations rather than valuable learning. Where schools articulate the cognitive benefits, intercultural understanding, career opportunities, and intrinsic enjoyment of language learning, uptake tends to be higher.

Effective options processes:
- Involve current language learners speaking positively about their experiences
- Showcase authentic use of languages (visitors, video calls with partner schools, career speakers)
- Avoid positioning MFL in opposition to other valued subjects
- Provide honest information about the demands and rewards of language GCSE

## Parental Engagement and Influence

### The Role of Parents in MFL Decision-Making

Parents and carers exert substantial influence over subject choices at GCSE. Research on family engagement in language learning emphasises that parental involvement is widely recognised as a key factor in academic success, yet in language learning it often plays a uniquely influential role. When parents view languages as valuable and actively engage with their child's language education, they create an environment that values multicultural perspectives, global awareness, and curiosity about the world.

Conversely, parents who lacked positive language learning experiences themselves, or who hold "Global English" attitudes, may unconsciously communicate scepticism about the value of MFL study. The decision to pursue a language for GCSE requires commitment and perseverance—precisely the qualities that parental support can help sustain.

### Barriers to Parental Engagement

Several barriers limit parental engagement with MFL:

**Language barriers:** Parents who are new to English or lack confidence in the target language may feel unable to support their child's learning, particularly if homework appears linguistically demanding.

**Educational background:** Parents who did not study languages beyond compulsory schooling may lack understanding of how language learning works and how they can support it.

**Perception of irrelevance:** Parents who do not use languages professionally or personally may struggle to articulate the value of MFL to their children.

**Time and resource constraints:** Working parents or those facing other pressures may lack capacity to engage with school communications about MFL.

### Strategies for Effective Parental Engagement

Effective MFL departments employ multiple strategies to engage parents:

**Practical support:** Providing resources that enable parents to support language learning at home, even without target language proficiency. This includes phonics guides, vocabulary learning strategies, and information about online resources.

**Communication:** Regular, accessible communication about what pupils are learning and how parents can support this. This should emphasise that language learning is not solely about grammatical accuracy but about communication and confidence.

**Showcasing achievement:** Creating opportunities for pupils to demonstrate their language learning to parents, whether through presentations, performances, or simply sharing work. Visible progress builds parental confidence in the subject.

**Addressing Global English:** Explicitly tackling the "everyone speaks English" narrative by sharing evidence about the career value of languages, the cognitive benefits of bilingualism, and the limitations of relying on others' English.

**Multilingual celebration:** Recognising and valuing the linguistic diversity that many families bring, including community languages. This positions language learning as building on existing capabilities rather than starting from nothing.

## Systemic Interventions and School-Level Strategies

### Creating a Culture Where Languages Thrive

Research by Coleman et al (2007) found that students in schools where senior teams made visible commitments to MFL were better motivated in the subject. Whole-school language policies, explicit valuing of multilingualism, and senior leadership engagement with language learning all signal to pupils that MFL matters.

Key elements of language-positive school cultures include:
- Visible displays of languages throughout the school
- Celebration of pupils' home languages alongside taught MFL
- International school partnerships and exchange programmes
- Senior leaders who speak positively about their own language learning
- Cross-curricular opportunities that demonstrate language utility

### Transition from Primary to Secondary

Unsatisfactory transitions from primary to secondary school are cited in multiple studies as a cause of poor MFL motivation. Where primary language provision is strong but secondary teaching fails to recognise prior learning, pupils experience demotivating repetition. Conversely, where pupils arrive from weak primary provision and are expected to perform at levels beyond their capability, self-efficacy collapses.

Effective transition practice includes:
- Robust information transfer about prior attainment
- Early secondary assessment that identifies what pupils can do
- Curriculum design that builds on prior learning while filling gaps
- Managing pupil expectations about secondary language learning

### Pedagogical Approaches That Support Motivation

Ofsted's review identified good curriculum design as vital for ensuring pupils securely learn the vocabulary, grammar, and phonics that enable autonomous language use. Motivation is supported when pupils experience genuine communicative success—using language to express their own meanings rather than merely reproducing textbook dialogues.

Enquiry-based learning approaches in MFL allow pupils to pursue topics of personal interest through the target language. Thinking skills and graphic organisers help pupils manage the cognitive load of language processing. Adaptive teaching that ensures all pupils experience appropriate challenge—not so easy as to bore, not so hard as to overwhelm—maintains the conditions for motivated engagement.

## Conclusion

Motivation and uptake in MFL are shaped by the interaction of individual psychological factors (self-concept, self-efficacy, perceived progress), institutional structures (options processes, school policy, transition arrangements), and social influences (parental attitudes, peer norms, societal narratives about language value).

Reversing the decline in MFL uptake requires attention to all these levels. Schools must create cultures where languages are visibly valued, ensure pedagogical approaches that build self-efficacy and make progress visible, engage parents as partners in supporting language learning, and manage the options process in ways that present MFL as genuinely optional yet educationally valuable.

The challenge is substantial but not insurmountable. Where schools commit to language learning as a whole-school priority, supported by senior leadership and informed by research on motivation and self-concept, MFL can thrive even within challenging national contexts.
