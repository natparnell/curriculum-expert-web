# Primary Languages Implementation

## Overview and Statutory Context

### The 2014 National Curriculum Requirements

Foreign languages became a statutory subject in English primary schools in September 2014, when the new National Curriculum (DfE, 2013) mandated that all Key Stage 2 pupils (Years 3-6, ages 7-11) receive teaching in a modern or ancient foreign language. This represented a significant policy shift, reversing the decision to make languages optional at Key Stage 2 in 2004 and re-establishing the expectation that primary-aged children would have systematic exposure to language learning.

The statutory requirements, set out in the National Curriculum Programme of Study for Languages, specify that teaching should "lay the foundations" for foreign language learning at Key Stage 3 and beyond. Schools have autonomy to choose which language or languages to teach, with the majority opting for French, Spanish, or German, though Latin and other languages are also permissible. The curriculum sets out three broad attainment targets: listening and responding, speaking, and reading and writing, though the relative emphasis on each varies by year group.

Notably, languages remain non-statutory at Key Stage 1 (Years 1-2) and the Early Years Foundation Stage, though many schools choose to introduce languages earlier through informal exposure, songs, and cultural activities. The Association for Language Learning (ALL) and RiPL (Research in Primary Languages) both advocate for early exposure where possible, noting that younger children often demonstrate greater willingness to experiment with pronunciation and less anxiety about making mistakes.

### The "Minimum One Hour" Recommendation

While the National Curriculum establishes that languages must be taught at Key Stage 2, it does not specify a minimum time allocation. This policy gap has led to considerable variation in practice across English primary schools. In response, RiPL (Holmes and Myles, 2019) published a White Paper recommending a minimum of one hour per week of dedicated language teaching, amounting to approximately 35 hours per academic year for each of the four Key Stage 2 years.

This recommendation is based on research into effective language learning time and the cumulative exposure needed to achieve measurable progress. The Frontiers in Education review (2023) found that in almost half of surveyed schools, time allocation falls below this threshold, with many primary teachers reporting that languages compete for timetable space against the highly monitored core subjects of English and mathematics. Where schools do meet the one-hour minimum, outcomes in pupil confidence, vocabulary retention, and readiness for secondary language study are significantly improved.

Ofsted's 2021 curriculum research review for languages emphasised that insufficient curriculum time represents a significant barrier to quality provision. Inspectors noted that schools achieving good or outstanding outcomes typically allocate protected time for languages, treating it as a genuine curriculum subject rather than an enrichment activity squeezed into marginal spaces in the weekly timetable.

## Models of Delivery: Specialist versus Class Teacher

### The Three Main Models

Ofsted's blog on languages in outstanding primary schools (May 2021) identified three predominant models for delivering primary languages, each with distinct advantages and challenges:

**Model 1: The Visiting Specialist Teacher**

Under this model, a teacher with specialist language qualifications—either employed directly by the school or supplied through a local authority or academy trust service—visits on a regular schedule to deliver discrete language lessons. The specialist typically works across multiple classes or even multiple schools, providing expertise that generalist class teachers may lack.

The advantages of this model include high-quality language input from a fluent or native speaker, consistent pedagogy informed by subject-specific training, and reduced burden on class teachers who may feel inadequately prepared to teach languages. Research by Hunt et al. (2008) for RiPL found that specialist-led provision often results in more accurate target language pronunciation and more sophisticated grammatical explanations than class teacher delivery.

However, the model presents significant challenges. Continuity between lessons can suffer when the specialist visits infrequently. Class teachers may treat the language lesson as "the specialist's time" and fail to reinforce learning between sessions. Ofsted observed that in the most effective implementations of this model, class teachers actively practised what the specialist had taught during the week between language lessons, integrating vocabulary and phrases into daily routines and other curriculum areas.

**Model 2: The Class Teacher as Language Teacher**

In this model, class teachers deliver languages as part of their regular teaching responsibilities. This approach maximises integration potential—language learning can be woven throughout the week rather than confined to a single slot—and ensures that the adult who knows the children best is facilitating their language development.

The primary barrier to this model is teacher confidence and competence. The 2019 Teacher Workload Survey found that only 15% of primary teachers felt confident teaching a foreign language, with many reporting anxiety about their own pronunciation and grammatical knowledge. The model relies heavily on high-quality resources and professional development. Organisations such as the Primary Languages Network, Language Angels, and Linguascope provide schemes of work that support non-specialist teachers, including audio support for pronunciation and detailed lesson plans.

Ofsted's research review noted that where class teachers deliver languages effectively, the subject becomes truly embedded in the school culture. Teachers use target language for classroom routines, display bilingual labels, and make connections between language learning and other curriculum areas. This integration is harder to achieve when a visiting specialist delivers discrete lessons.

**Model 3: The Native Speaker Staff Member**

Some schools utilise bilingual staff members—often teaching assistants, midday supervisors, or administrative staff—to lead language provision. This model leverages existing human resources and provides authentic language models.

While native speaker input is valuable, Ofsted cautioned that being a native speaker does not equate to being a language teacher. Effective implementation requires pedagogical training, planning time, and curriculum oversight. Without these elements, provision can become inconsistent, with conversation-based activities failing to build systematic linguistic progression. The most successful implementations combine the native speaker's linguistic expertise with planning support from a qualified teacher or subject leader.

### Hybrid and Emerging Models

Many schools operate hybrid models, combining elements of the approaches above. For example, a specialist teacher might deliver fortnightly "deep learning" sessions while class teachers reinforce vocabulary daily through classroom routines. Alternatively, schools might use online platforms or video resources to provide native-speaker input, with class teachers facilitating practice activities.

The ELAPSE project (Embedding Languages across Primary and Secondary Education) has developed resources supporting integration approaches, where language learning is embedded within the broader curriculum rather than taught as a discrete subject. This Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) approach, while demanding to implement, can address time constraints by combining language objectives with subject learning in history, geography, science, or other areas.

## Subject Leadership and Coordination

### The Primary Languages Coordinator Role

Effective primary languages implementation depends critically on strong subject leadership. The languages coordinator (variously titled MFL Lead, Subject Coordinator, or Curriculum Lead for Languages) holds responsibility for strategic oversight, quality assurance, and professional development across the school.

Key responsibilities typically include:

**Curriculum Planning and Sequencing:** The coordinator ensures that the language curriculum builds progressively from Year 3 to Year 6, with clear endpoints and expectations for each year group. This includes mapping phonics, grammar, and vocabulary across the Key Stage, ensuring that prior learning is revisited and built upon.

**Resource Management:** Whether the school uses a commercial scheme of work (such as Language Angels, Rigolo, or Salut) or has developed its own curriculum, the coordinator manages resources, ensures materials are up-to-date, and identifies gaps or areas requiring supplementation.

**Monitoring and Assessment:** The coordinator oversees assessment practices, ensuring that teachers capture evidence of pupil progress and that assessment informs future planning. This may involve coordinating moderation activities, reviewing pupil work, and tracking the progress of specific groups (such as pupils with SEND or those eligible for pupil premium funding).

**Professional Development:** For schools using class teacher delivery, the coordinator provides training and support, building teacher confidence and pedagogical knowledge. This might include modelling lessons, providing pronunciation coaching, or sourcing external training opportunities through organisations like ALL, the British Council, or local teaching school hubs.

**Transition Management:** The coordinator facilitates communication with receiving secondary schools, sharing information about the languages taught, topics covered, and pupil attainment levels. This transition work is crucial for maintaining continuity as pupils move from primary to secondary education.

### Senior Leadership Team Engagement

Languages provision cannot thrive without active support from the Senior Leadership Team (SLT). The Primary Languages Award, developed by the Primary Languages Network, identifies SLT briefing and engagement as a key criterion for effective provision. Where languages are genuinely prioritised, the subject appears on the School Development Plan, has allocated budget for resources and training, and receives monitoring time comparable to other foundation subjects.

The most effective SLT engagement goes beyond passive approval to active championing. Headteachers and deputy headteachers visit language lessons, ask probing questions about progression and challenge, and ensure that languages feature in school communication with parents. Where SLT members themselves speak languages or value language learning, this modelling effect can significantly elevate the status of the subject within the school culture.

## Whole-School Approaches and Curriculum Integration

### Creating a Language-Rich Environment

Outstanding primary language provision extends beyond the discrete weekly lesson to infuse the school environment with linguistic and cultural richness. This whole-school approach normalises language learning and provides multiple low-stakes opportunities for practice and exposure.

Environmental strategies include:

**Bilingual Displays:** Classrooms and corridors feature dual-language labels, with everyday objects, classroom areas, and learning resources labelled in both English and the target language. This constant visual exposure supports incidental vocabulary acquisition.

**Routines and Rituals:** Schools embed target language into daily routines—register-taking, giving instructions, lining up, and dismissal can all incorporate set phrases. Some schools adopt a "French Friday" or "Spanish Day" approach, where all communication (or a defined subset) takes place in the target language.

**Cultural Celebration:** Effective provision connects language learning to cultural understanding. Schools celebrate festivals (such as European Day of Languages, Chinese New Year, or Día de los Muertos), sample cuisine, listen to music, and explore literature and art from target language countries. This cultural dimension maintains motivation and broadens pupils' global awareness.

**Cross-Curricular Integration:** Language learning can be integrated with other curriculum areas. Counting and number work in mathematics can be practised in the target language. Geography topics on weather or climate can incorporate meteorological vocabulary. History topics can explore the target language country's past. Music lessons can include songs in the target language. This integration maximises curriculum time and demonstrates the practical utility of language skills.

### The CLIL Approach

Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) represents a more systematic approach to integration, where subject content is taught through the medium of a foreign language. Developed in European contexts, CLIL has gained traction in UK primary schools as a response to time pressures and as a pedagogically rich approach that mirrors how young children acquire their first language—through meaningful context rather than explicit instruction.

According to Coyle (2007), CLIL is an umbrella term encompassing various approaches that combine content learning with language development. In primary settings, this might involve teaching a science topic about plants entirely in French, or exploring a geography topic on rivers through Spanish. The approach requires careful planning to ensure that both content and language objectives are met, and that pupils are not disadvantaged in their subject learning by the language demands.

RiPL's research into CLIL in primary settings notes that the approach offers flexibility—it can be implemented at classroom level by individual teachers or adopted as a whole-school approach. Schools implementing CLIL report high levels of pupil engagement and accelerated vocabulary acquisition, though the approach places significant demands on teacher expertise and planning time.

## Transition from Primary to Secondary

### The Transition Challenge

The transition from primary to secondary language learning represents a critical vulnerability in the language education pipeline. Research consistently shows that many pupils experience regression in language skills during the transition period, with secondary teachers reporting that incoming Year 7 pupils demonstrate less competence than their primary records suggest.

RiPL's summary of research by Hunt et al. (2008) identified several factors contributing to this "transition gap":

**Curriculum Discontinuity:** Primary and secondary schools often teach different languages, meaning that pupils who studied French for four years at primary school may begin Spanish or German anew in Year 7. Even where the language continues, topic sequencing may not align, with secondary teachers assuming no prior knowledge and primary learning being repeated or ignored.

**Pedagogical Shift:** Primary language learning typically emphasises oral communication, songs, games, and cultural exploration. Secondary language teaching often shifts rapidly toward grammatical analysis, written accuracy, and formal assessment. This abrupt change in approach can alienate pupils who enjoyed the primary experience.

**Assessment Information:** Secondary schools often receive limited information about primary pupils' language attainment. Without standardised assessments or detailed portfolios, secondary teachers may make assumptions about prior learning that lead to inappropriate placement or teaching.

**Attitudinal Changes:** The transition period coincides with adolescence, when pupils may become more self-conscious about speaking in front of peers and less willing to take linguistic risks. The secondary environment, with larger class sizes and more formal relationships, can exacerbate these anxieties.

### Strategies for Effective Transition

Addressing transition challenges requires proactive collaboration between primary and secondary colleagues:

**Joint Planning:** Cluster groups of primary schools and their receiving secondary should meet regularly to align curriculum content, ensuring that primary learning is recognised and built upon in Year 7. The ELAPSE project provides schemes of work designed for cross-phase continuity.

**Information Sharing:** Primary schools should provide detailed transition information, including topics covered, vocabulary banks, and assessment evidence. Some schools create language passports or portfolios that pupils carry to secondary school, showcasing their achievements and interests.

**Pedagogical Bridge-Building:** Secondary teachers can visit primary schools to observe practice and understand the pedagogical approaches pupils are familiar with. Conversely, primary colleagues can attend secondary induction sessions to understand the expectations awaiting their former pupils.

**Taster and Enrichment Activities:** Secondary schools can maintain engagement through transition activities—taster lessons, language clubs, or cultural events—that help pupils see language learning as a continuous journey rather than a fresh start.

## Time Allocation and Timetabling

### The Evidence on Time and Progress

RiPL's longitudinal study, "Progression in Primary Languages," is tracking children's linguistic development throughout Key Stage 2 to understand the relationship between time allocation and learning outcomes. Early findings confirm what practitioners have long suspected: pupils who receive more curriculum time make more progress, particularly in oral fluency and vocabulary retention.

The research identifies a threshold effect—pupils receiving less than 45 minutes per week show minimal progress, while those receiving 60-90 minutes demonstrate significantly stronger outcomes. Beyond 90 minutes, returns diminish, suggesting that the RiPL-recommended one hour represents an optimal minimum rather than a maximum.

Ofsted's subject inspections found that in schools where languages thrive, time is protected in the timetable and treated as non-negotiable. In contrast, where languages are marginalised, they are frequently displaced by assemblies, special events, or interventions in English and mathematics. This "displacement effect" is particularly damaging because language learning depends on regular, spaced practice—missed weeks cannot easily be compensated.

### Creative Timetabling Solutions

Schools facing severe time pressures have developed creative approaches to maintaining language provision:

**Blocked Provision:** Some schools adopt intensive "language weeks" or fortnightly blocks where languages receive concentrated attention, followed by maintenance activities in intervening periods. While this provides more total time than a minimal weekly slot, the spacing of learning is suboptimal.

**Lunchtime and After-School Clubs:** Voluntary language clubs can supplement curriculum time, though equity concerns arise if only motivated or supported pupils access these opportunities.

**Digital Resources:** Online platforms and apps can support home learning, extending exposure beyond the school day. However, this depends on home internet access and parental support, creating potential equity gaps.

**Integration Through Other Subjects:** As noted above, CLIL and cross-curricular integration can effectively increase language exposure without requiring additional discrete curriculum time.

## Common Challenges and Evidence-Informed Solutions

### Teacher Confidence and Subject Knowledge

The most frequently cited barrier to effective primary language provision is teacher confidence. Many primary teachers trained before 2014 when languages became statutory, and significant proportions report feeling inadequately prepared to teach a foreign language.

**Solutions:** High-quality commercial schemes with embedded audio support reduce the burden on teacher pronunciation. Subject associations (ALL, RiPL) provide free resources and communities of practice. Teaching school hubs and academy trusts increasingly offer language-specific professional development. Some schools appoint a specialist teacher or HLTA to model lessons and coach colleagues.

### Assessment Without Levels

The removal of National Curriculum levels in 2014 left primary teachers without a standardised framework for assessing language progress. Schools have developed varied approaches, from commercial assessment schemes to locally-devised frameworks.

**Solutions:** The Expert Subject Advisory Group for MFL (2015) published guidance on primary assessment, recommending a focus on can-do statements and evidence portfolios rather than numerical levels. OFQUAL has noted the importance of teacher assessment moderation to ensure consistency. The most effective schools collect video and audio evidence of pupil speaking, creating portfolios that demonstrate progress over time and support transition information sharing.

### Maintaining Motivation and Engagement

As pupils progress through Key Stage 2, some show declining motivation for language learning, particularly where they perceive limited relevance or where pedagogical approaches become repetitive.

**Solutions:** Curricula that include cultural exploration, authentic materials (such as children's books, cartoons, and songs from target language countries), and real-world application maintain engagement. Pen pal schemes, school exchanges (even virtual), and contact with native speakers provide authentic purposes for communication. Gamification through apps like Duolingo or Linguascope can supplement classroom learning, though these should complement rather than replace interactive, communicative teaching.

### SEND and Inclusion

Pupils with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities can thrive in language learning, but require appropriate scaffolding and adapted expectations. Concerns about cognitive overload sometimes lead to pupils being withdrawn from language lessons for intervention in English or mathematics, potentially compounding their curriculum access disadvantage.

**Solutions:** Adaptive teaching approaches that use visual supports, multi-sensory activities, and repetition benefit all learners, including those with SEND. The Association for Language Learning provides guidance on inclusive MFL practice. Schools with the strongest inclusive practice recognise that language learning supports metalinguistic awareness and can reinforce English literacy development.

## Conclusion: The Path Forward

Primary language provision in England has made significant progress since 2014, but substantial variability remains. The schools achieving the strongest outcomes share common characteristics: protected curriculum time of at least one hour per week; a clearly defined model of
