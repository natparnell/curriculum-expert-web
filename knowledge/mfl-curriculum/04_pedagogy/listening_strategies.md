# Listening Strategies in MFL: Pre-, While-, and Post-Listening Pedagogy

## Introduction: The Centrality of Listening in MFL

Listening comprehension represents one of the most challenging yet foundational skills in modern foreign language learning. Research consistently demonstrates that learners of MFL in England perceive listening as one of the most difficult skills in which to improve, particularly beyond the immediate beginner stage (Graham, 2006). This perception is compounded by the reality that listening is often the least taught skill in MFL classrooms, with teachers frequently engaging in "doing" or "testing" listening rather than explicitly teaching learners how to listen effectively (Chambers, 1996; Graham, 2017).

The development of listening competence extends far beyond exposure to target language audio materials. It requires systematic pedagogical approaches that scaffold learner development across three distinct phases: pre-listening, while-listening, and post-listening activities. Each phase serves specific cognitive and metacognitive functions, working together to build both bottom-up decoding abilities and top-down comprehension strategies. The National Curriculum for MFL places strong emphasis on understanding language from a range of authentic sources and exploring the patterns and sounds of language—objectives that demand particular attention to developing learners' listening skills from Key Stage 2 through to Key Stage 4 and beyond.

This knowledge file examines evidence-based approaches to teaching listening across all three phases, drawing on research from the University of Reading, the PDC in MFL (Professional Development Consortium), and international scholarship on metacognitive strategy instruction. It provides practical frameworks for classroom implementation while situating listening pedagogy within broader curriculum goals.

## Theoretical Foundations: How Listening Comprehension Works

### Bottom-Up and Top-Down Processing

Listening comprehension involves two complementary cognitive processes that operate simultaneously during authentic communication. Understanding the distinction between these processes is essential for designing effective listening instruction.

**Bottom-up processing** proceeds from the smallest units of language to larger meaning structures. In this model, listeners decode the sound signal bit by bit, beginning with individual phonemes and building towards word recognition, phrase comprehension, and finally full meaning construction. This process involves:

- Recognising individual phonemes and phoneme sequences that form words
- Identifying word boundaries in continuous speech
- Recognising stressed syllables and intonation contours
- Processing syllable reduction due to weak forms and elision
- Recognising connected speech features such as catenation and assimilation
- Accessing vocabulary knowledge to match heard sounds with stored meanings

Bottom-up processing becomes particularly important when listening to directions, distinguishing similar-sounding words, or comprehending speech in noisy environments. Without adequate bottom-up skills, listeners cannot effectively parse the speech stream into meaningful units, regardless of their background knowledge about a topic.

**Top-down processing** operates in the reverse direction, with listeners bringing their prior knowledge, contextual understanding, and expectations to the comprehension task. This process involves:

- Activating background knowledge about the topic
- Using context to predict upcoming content
- Making inferences based on partial understanding
- Recognising discourse markers and text structure
- Applying understanding of genre conventions
- Drawing on world knowledge to fill gaps in linguistic understanding

Top-down processing allows listeners to compensate for gaps in bottom-up decoding. When encountering unfamiliar vocabulary or unclear pronunciation, listeners can use their expectations about what makes sense in context to construct probable meanings.

**Interactive processing** represents the reality of skilled listening, where bottom-up and top-down processes operate in constant interaction. Fluent listeners continuously shift between these approaches, using bottom-up information to confirm or revise top-down predictions while drawing on top-down knowledge to interpret ambiguous bottom-up signals. Effective listening instruction must develop both processing capacities while teaching learners to coordinate them strategically.

### Metacognitive Awareness and Self-Regulation

Beyond the cognitive mechanisms of comprehension, successful listening depends on metacognitive awareness—learners' understanding of their own listening processes and their ability to regulate these processes strategically. Metacognition in listening encompasses three interrelated components:

**Person knowledge** involves learners' understanding of themselves as listeners, including their strengths and weaknesses, their confidence levels (self-efficacy), and their beliefs about what makes listening difficult or easy. Learners with accurate person knowledge can approach listening tasks with appropriate strategies and realistic expectations.

**Task knowledge** concerns understanding the demands of different listening situations. This includes recognising that listening to a film clip differs fundamentally from following directions, that authentic materials present greater challenges than scripted textbook audio, and that different purposes (getting the gist versus extracting specific information) require different approaches.

**Strategy knowledge** encompasses awareness of the range of cognitive and metacognitive strategies available for listening, together with knowledge of when and how to deploy them effectively. Strategic listeners can select appropriate approaches based on task demands, monitor their comprehension during listening, and evaluate their success afterwards.

Research by Graham and Macaro (2008) demonstrates that explicit metacognitive strategy instruction significantly improves both listening attainment and learner self-efficacy. Their intervention study with Year 9 French learners showed that learners receiving strategy training outperformed control groups on listening assessments and reported greater confidence in their listening abilities.

## Pre-Listening Activities: Preparation and Prediction

### Purpose and Pedagogical Rationale

Pre-listening activities serve multiple crucial functions in the listening lesson. First, they activate learners' prior knowledge about the topic, creating mental frameworks into which new information can be integrated. Research on schema theory demonstrates that comprehension improves substantially when listeners can relate new input to existing knowledge structures. Second, pre-listening establishes purpose by clarifying what learners should attend to during the listening activity. Without clear purpose, learners approach listening tasks without selective attention strategies, attempting to understand everything rather than prioritising key information. Third, pre-listening reduces anxiety by building confidence and familiarity before learners encounter the challenges of the target language audio. Fourth, pre-listening provides necessary linguistic and cultural scaffolding, introducing key vocabulary, concepts, or cultural references that might otherwise block comprehension.

### Activating Prior Knowledge

Effective pre-listening begins with activities that connect the upcoming listening text to learners' existing knowledge and experience. This activation serves both cognitive and affective functions, preparing mental frameworks while increasing engagement and relevance.

**Brainstorming and mind-mapping** activities invite learners to share what they already know about a topic before listening. For a listening text about healthy eating, learners might work in groups to generate vocabulary and ideas related to food, nutrition, and lifestyle. This not only activates relevant schemata but also surfaces vocabulary that will appear in the text, reducing the cognitive burden during listening.

**Picture prediction** uses visual stimuli to elicit predictions about content. Showing images related to the listening topic—perhaps photographs, cartoons, or infographics—encourages learners to hypothesise about what they will hear. These predictions create expectancies that guide selective attention during listening, making the process more focused and efficient.

**Discussion questions** that probe learners' personal experience with a topic build both engagement and relevant knowledge. Before listening to a text about school exchanges, learners might discuss their own travel experiences, their expectations about staying with host families, or their questions about life in other countries. This personal connection increases motivation while activating relevant conceptual frameworks.

### Establishing Purpose and Predicting Content

Establishing clear listening purpose is essential for developing selective attention strategies. Rather than simply instructing learners to "listen and understand," effective pre-listening specifies what information learners should extract and how they will use it.

**Prediction from titles and rubrics** trains learners to use available information to anticipate content. Examining the title of a listening text, any accompanying images, and the questions learners will subsequently answer enables reasoned predictions about content, register, and key vocabulary. These predictions create a mental roadmap for listening, helping learners distinguish important from peripheral information.

**Pre-reading questions or tasks** provide specific purposes for listening. If learners know they will need to identify five advantages of a proposal, they can listen strategically for evaluative language and points in favour. If they know they need to complete a gap-fill exercise, they can anticipate the grammatical and lexical categories required.

**Activating text-type knowledge** prepares learners for the specific demands of different listening genres. Listening to a telephone message requires different strategies than following a news report or understanding a conversation. Pre-listening activities might highlight the conventions of particular genres—how news reports typically begin with headline summaries, how conversations include hesitations and interruptions, how lectures use signposting language—enabling learners to apply appropriate comprehension strategies.

### Vocabulary and Linguistic Preparation

While extensive pre-teaching of vocabulary can reduce listening to a simple matching exercise, strategic preparation of key linguistic elements removes unnecessary barriers to comprehension while preserving the authentic challenges of listening.

**Key vocabulary activation** focuses on high-frequency content words that are essential for understanding the main message. This is particularly important for proper nouns (names of people, places, organisations), technical terms, and low-frequency words that learners would not reasonably be expected to recognise. The principle is to remove vocabulary that would block comprehension of the main message while preserving enough challenge to develop listening skills.

**Phonological preparation** addresses the specific challenges of spoken language. This might involve practising the pronunciation of key words that will appear in the text, particularly those with tricky sound-spelling correspondences. It might include awareness-raising activities about connected speech features—how words blend together in fast speech, how unstressed syllables reduce, how intonation patterns convey meaning. For learners struggling with bottom-up processing, such preparation is essential.

**Syntax and discourse marker awareness** prepares learners for the grammatical structures and organisational signals in the upcoming text. If a listening text uses complex subordinate clauses, learners might benefit from briefly reviewing relevant conjunctions. If it uses discourse markers to signal contrast (however, on the other hand), addition (furthermore, moreover), or conclusion (in conclusion, to sum up), highlighting these beforehand supports top-down processing.

## While-Listening Activities: Guided Comprehension and Strategy Development

### First Listen: Establishing Global Understanding

The initial exposure to a listening text should focus on global comprehension rather than detail extraction. This first listen establishes the framework of understanding onto which details can subsequently be mapped.

**Gist tasks** require learners to identify the main topic, the general purpose of the text, or the overall situation being described. These tasks might ask learners to choose the best summary from several options, to match the text to a context description, or to identify the speaker's main purpose. The key is that success requires only general comprehension, reducing anxiety and allowing learners to experience success even if they miss many details.

**Listening for attitude or tone** focuses on the affective dimension of the message. Is the speaker enthusiastic or reluctant? Supportive or critical? Certain or tentative? Such tasks develop learners' awareness of paralinguistic features—tone of voice, intonation, emphasis—that carry significant meaning beyond the literal words.

**Visual support tasks** use graphic organisers to scaffold global comprehension. Learners might complete a timeline while listening to a biographical text, fill in a table comparing two viewpoints, or add information to a concept map. These structures provide external scaffolding for organising incoming information, reducing the working memory demands of listening.

### Second and Subsequent Listens: Detail Extraction and Strategy Development

Further listens focus on extracting specific information and developing specific listening strategies. Each listen should have a clear, different purpose to maintain engagement and develop flexible listening skills.

**Specific information tasks** require learners to extract particular details—dates, figures, names, specific facts. These tasks develop selective attention strategies, teaching learners to listen for specific information types while ignoring irrelevant content. They also develop note-taking skills as learners must record information efficiently.

**Inference tasks** require learners to go beyond literal comprehension to infer unstated meanings. What is implied by the speaker's choice of words? What can be deduced from what is not said? Such tasks develop higher-order comprehension skills and awareness of how language conveys meaning indirectly.

**Language-focused listening** draws attention to specific linguistic features. Learners might listen specifically for instances of a grammatical structure, for examples of particular discourse markers, or for vocabulary related to a specific semantic field. This focus integrates listening with explicit language learning while developing bottom-up processing skills.

### Developing Bottom-Up Decoding Skills

Many MFL learners struggle particularly with bottom-up processing—the ability to parse the continuous speech stream into individual words and sounds. While-listening activities can systematically develop these skills.

**Segmentation practice** helps learners identify word boundaries in connected speech. Activities might involve listening to short phrases and indicating how many words were heard, or matching heard phrases to written alternatives that represent different segmentation possibilities (e.g., distinguishing "ice cream" from "I scream").

**Phoneme discrimination** develops learners' ability to distinguish similar sounds in the target language. Minimal pair activities—listening to words that differ by only one sound and identifying which was heard—build phonemic awareness essential for accurate word recognition.

**Weak form and schwa recognition** addresses the challenge that unstressed syllables in English and other languages often reduce to a neutral vowel sound (schwa). Activities might focus on identifying function words (prepositions, auxiliary verbs) in their weak forms, or recognising how content words maintain stress while function words reduce.

**Connected speech awareness** develops recognition of how words change when they occur together in phrases. This includes catenation (linking final consonants to initial vowels across word boundaries), assimilation (sounds changing to become more like neighbouring sounds), and elision (sounds being omitted). Understanding these processes helps learners match heard speech to their stored knowledge of word forms.

### Developing Top-Down Comprehension Strategies

While bottom-up skills develop the ability to decode the speech signal, top-down strategies enable learners to compensate for gaps in decoding by drawing on context and knowledge.

**Prediction monitoring** involves actively comparing incoming information with predictions made during pre-listening. Learners might be encouraged to note whether their predictions were confirmed or contradicted, adjusting their understanding as they listen. This develops the flexible, hypothesis-testing approach characteristic of skilled listeners.

**Contextual inferencing** involves using context to guess the meaning of unknown words or phrases. Activities might explicitly ask learners to identify words they didn't understand and to explain what clues they used to infer meaning—surrounding words, topic knowledge, grammatical context.

**Listening for signpost language** develops awareness of how speakers structure discourse. Learners might listen specifically for language that signals topic shifts (moving on to..., another point is...), exemplification (for example, for instance), contrast (however, on the other hand), or conclusion (in conclusion, to sum up). Recognising these signals supports the top-down construction of discourse structure.

## Post-Listening Activities: Reflection, Consolidation, and Extension

### Metacognitive Reflection and Strategy Evaluation

Post-listening activities are frequently neglected in MFL classrooms, yet they serve essential functions for developing independent listening competence. Most importantly, they provide opportunities for metacognitive reflection—helping learners become aware of their own listening processes and evaluate their strategy use.

**Comprehension checking** should extend beyond simply marking answers as correct or incorrect. Learners should be encouraged to identify which parts of the text they found difficult and to hypothesise why—unfamiliar vocabulary, fast speech, complex grammar, lack of background knowledge. This analysis develops person knowledge and helps learners identify their specific listening challenges.

**Strategy evaluation** asks learners to reflect on which strategies they used and how effective these were. Did their predictions help? Did they successfully use context to guess unknown words? Were they able to maintain concentration throughout? Such reflection builds metacognitive awareness and helps learners develop their personal repertoire of effective strategies.

**Comparing approaches** can involve learners discussing how they approached the listening task and what they found helpful. This peer sharing exposes learners to alternative strategies they might not have considered and validates the diversity of effective approaches.

### Language Analysis and Consolidation

Listening texts provide rich opportunities for language-focused work that consolidates vocabulary, grammar, and discourse patterns encountered in the input.

**Vocabulary consolidation** might involve extracting useful words and phrases from the text, recording them in vocabulary notebooks, and creating opportunities for active use. Rather than treating vocabulary as isolated items, this approach embeds new language in the meaningful context of the listening text.

**Transcription and dictation** activities develop the connection between sound and written forms. Selective transcription—writing down specific categories of language from the text, or completing partial transcripts—supports bottom-up processing while reinforcing spelling and grammatical patterns.

**Shadowing and repetition** involve learners listening again and speaking along with the recording, attempting to match pronunciation, intonation, and rhythm. This technique, developed in interpreter training, develops phonological awareness and speaking fluency while reinforcing listening comprehension.

### Extending and Applying Learning

Post-listening activities should also extend learning beyond the specific text, applying skills and language to new contexts and integrating listening with other language skills.

**Discussion and personal response** activities invite learners to react to the content of what they heard, express opinions, and make connections to their own experience. This develops speaking skills while deepening engagement with the listening material.

**Follow-up writing tasks** might involve responding to what was heard—a letter to a character, a summary of the main points, a personal reaction piece. Such tasks integrate listening with writing while providing evidence of comprehension.

**Transfer activities** challenge learners to apply strategies practised with the current text to new listening materials. This might involve independent listening to related texts, with learners explicitly encouraged to use the strategies they have been taught.

## Developing Listening Competence Across Key Stages

### Key Stage 2: Foundations of Listening

At Key Stage 2, the focus should be on building positive attitudes towards listening while establishing foundational skills. The National Curriculum for Key Stage 2 Languages emphasises listening to spoken language and showing understanding by joining in and responding, exploring the patterns and sounds of language, and understanding basic grammar.

**Emphasis on extensive listening** means providing rich exposure to the spoken language through songs, stories, rhymes, and games. At this stage, quantity of comprehensible input is more important than detailed comprehension of every word.

**Developing phonological awareness** involves systematic attention to the sound system of the target language, including sound-spelling correspondences that differ from English. Activities should highlight how the target language sounds, building the bottom-up decoding skills that will support later listening.

**Listening as a social activity** embeds listening within meaningful communication. Young learners should listen to understand and respond, with listening integrated into games, songs, and interactive activities rather than treated as a separate skill.

### Key Stage 3: Developing Strategic Listening

Key Stage 3 represents a crucial period for developing strategic listening competence. The National Curriculum emphasises understanding authentic spoken material from a range of sources, identifying key points and details, and
