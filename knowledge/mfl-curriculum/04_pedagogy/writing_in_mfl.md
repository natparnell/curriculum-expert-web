# Writing in MFL: Scaffolded Writing, Modelling, Translation, and Spontaneous Production

## Introduction: The Centrality of Writing in MFL

Writing represents one of the four core language skills—alongside listening, speaking, and reading—that pupils must develop to achieve communicative competence in a modern foreign language. In the context of UK MFL education, writing serves multiple purposes: it consolidates grammatical knowledge, provides a tangible record of learning, develops metalinguistic awareness, and prepares pupils for high-stakes assessments at GCSE and beyond.

The Ofsted framework for inspecting languages places significant emphasis on pupils' ability to produce written language. Under the "Quality of Education" judgement, inspectors evaluate whether the curriculum enables pupils to "write in the language with increasing accuracy and creativity" (Ofsted, 2019). This judgement extends beyond mere grammatical correctness to encompass the development of genuine communicative intent—pupils writing for real purposes to real audiences.

Writing in MFL presents unique challenges that distinguish it from writing in English or other first language contexts. Pupils must simultaneously manage multiple cognitive demands: lexical retrieval, grammatical encoding, orthographic accuracy, discourse organisation, and pragmatic appropriateness. Research by Williams and Burden (1997) identifies writing as the most cognitively demanding of the four skills because it requires the complete absence of the interlocutor who, in spoken interaction, might provide scaffolding through clarification requests or collaborative meaning-making.

Effective MFL writing pedagogy therefore requires careful scaffolding that gradually releases responsibility to learners. The Language-Driven Pedagogy approach developed at the University of York emphasises that "pupils should be taught to pay attention to the detail of meaning through translation, and should extend the range of their vocabulary and understanding through reading short texts and literature" (University of York, 2023). This guidance points towards a comprehensive approach that integrates multiple strategies—scaffolded writing, modelling, translation, and opportunities for spontaneous production.

## Scaffolded Writing: Building Confidence Through Structured Support

### The Theoretical Foundation of Scaffolding

The concept of scaffolding derives from Vygotsky's (1978) Zone of Proximal Development—the gap between what a learner can do independently and what they can achieve with expert guidance. In MFL writing, scaffolding takes multiple forms: writing frames, sentence starters, substitution tables, vocabulary banks, and grammatical prompts. These temporary structures enable pupils to produce language beyond their independent capability while internalising patterns for future independent use.

Pauline Gibbons' influential work "Scaffolding Language, Scaffolding Learning" (2014) emphasises that effective scaffolding is not merely about simplifying tasks but about making the thinking visible. In MFL writing, this translates into providing pupils with the conceptual and linguistic tools to express complex ideas, rather than restricting them to simple utterances. Gibbons argues that scaffolding should be "contingent"—adjusted in response to the learner's developing competence—and "collaborative," involving interaction between teacher and pupil or among peers.

### Types of Writing Scaffolds in MFL

**Writing Frames** provide the organisational structure for a text, indicating what information should be included in each section. For example, a frame for describing a past holiday might include prompts such as:
- "Last summer, I went to..."
- "I travelled by..."
- "The weather was..."
- "I particularly enjoyed..."

These frames reduce the cognitive load associated with discourse organisation, allowing pupils to focus on linguistic encoding. As the National College for Teaching and Leadership notes in its guidance on primary MFL, writing frames enable pupils to "produce more complex language than they could generate independently" (National College, 2023).

**Sentence Builders** offer a more granular level of support, providing sentence stems that pupils complete with appropriate vocabulary. In the early stages of language learning, these might be highly structured: "J'aime _______ parce que c'est _______." As proficiency develops, sentence builders can incorporate more complex grammatical features: "Bien que je préfère _______, je reconnais que _______."

**Substitution Tables** present vocabulary choices in a tabular format, supporting pupils to create multiple sentence variations from a common structure. For example:

| Subject | Verb | Object |
|---------|------|--------|
| Je | joue | au football |
| Tu | joues | au tennis |
| Il/Elle | joue | au basketball |

This format makes grammatical patterns visually salient while allowing for creative variation within a controlled framework.

**Vocabulary Banks** provide topic-specific lexical resources, often organised thematically or alphabetically. Effective vocabulary banks include not just single words but collocations and chunks—recurrent multi-word combinations that fluent speakers use as prefabricated units. Research by Michael Lewis (1993) on the Lexical Approach highlights the importance of teaching such chunks to support fluent production.

### Gradual Release of Scaffolds

The ultimate goal of scaffolding is not permanent dependence but graduated independence. As the Teachwire guidance on differentiation in MFL emphasises, "scaffolding is key, but let's not forget that at some point that support will need to be removed so that pupils can work independently" (Teachwire, 2024).

This release should be strategic and responsive. Teachers might:
- Begin with fully scaffolded tasks where pupils select from provided options
- Progress to partially scaffolded tasks requiring some independent generation
- Move to minimally scaffolded tasks with strategic prompts at key difficulty points
- Culminate in unaided spontaneous writing

The decision to reduce scaffolding should be informed by assessment evidence. When pupils consistently demonstrate success at one level of support, the scaffold can be withdrawn or made optional. Differentiation within mixed-ability classrooms often involves providing tiered levels of scaffolding—full frames for some, sentence starters for others, and open-ended prompts for the most confident.

### Common Misconceptions and Pitfalls

A frequent error in scaffolded writing is confusing support with simplification. Reducing the task to word-level completion exercises (filling single-word gaps) does not develop writing competence. As Gibbons warns, "worksheet activities that simply require students to fill in single words... do little to develop control over the new language" (2014, p. 87).

Another pitfall is the premature removal of scaffolds. Teachers may observe a pupil's success with support and conclude that independence has been achieved, when in reality the pupil has not yet internalised the linguistic patterns. Assessment of writing should therefore include both scaffolded and independent productions to accurately gauge development.

## Modelling Writing: Making Expert Thinking Visible

### The Role of Modelling in MFL

Modelling involves the teacher demonstrating the writing process while articulating the thinking that underlies expert performance. Unlike simply presenting a finished text as an exemplar, modelling reveals the decision-making, self-correction, and strategic thinking that produce effective writing. In the context of MFL, this includes:
- Selecting appropriate vocabulary and register
- Choosing grammatical structures to convey precise meanings
- Monitoring for accuracy and self-correcting errors
- Organising ideas coherently
- Considering the audience and purpose

The TESOL International Association guidance on scaffolding emphasises that "modelling text structure is an essential strategy for teaching writing... as it demonstrates practical examples of how language is used in various contexts and how texts are organised" (TESOL, 2023).

### Think-Aloud Protocols

Think-aloud modelling involves the teacher composing text at the board or projected screen while verbalising their thought processes. This might include comments such as:
- "I want to say that the film was boring, so I need the adjective 'ennuyeux'—but wait, 'film' is masculine, so it should be 'ennuyeux' not 'ennuyeuse'..."
- "I'm not sure of the word for 'exciting'—let me think about synonyms I know... 'intéressant' might work, or perhaps I could rephrase using 'qui m'a beaucoup plu'..."
- "This sentence is getting quite long with multiple clauses. I should consider breaking it into two shorter sentences for clarity..."

Such demonstrations make metalinguistic thinking explicit, enabling pupils to adopt similar strategies in their independent writing.

### The Teaching and Learning Cycle

Gibbons (2014) proposes a teaching and learning cycle that integrates modelling with other pedagogical approaches:

1. **Building the Field**: Developing topic knowledge and vocabulary through reading, discussion, and exploration of model texts.
2. **Modelling and Deconstruction**: Teacher demonstration of text construction, with analysis of how expert writers achieve their effects.
3. **Joint Construction**: Collaborative writing between teacher and pupils, with the teacher scaffolding and pupils contributing ideas and language.
4. **Independent Construction**: Pupils write independently, applying what they have learned.

This cycle recognises that modelling is not a single event but part of a graduated progression towards independence. The joint construction phase is particularly valuable, as it provides the safety of teacher guidance while requiring pupils to make active linguistic choices.

### Digital Modelling and Visualisers

Modern technology extends modelling possibilities. Visualiser cameras enable teachers to model writing in real-time, including the false starts, corrections, and revisions that characterise authentic composition. This demystifies the writing process, showing pupils that expert writers do not produce perfect text instantaneously but engage in recursive planning, drafting, and editing.

Screen recording software allows teachers to create reusable modelling videos that pupils can revisit. This is particularly valuable for complex grammatical features—pupils may need multiple exposures before they internalise patterns such as the subjunctive or the passive voice.

### From Product to Process Modelling

Traditional approaches to modelling in MFL often focused on the product—presenting a completed text as a template for imitation. Contemporary pedagogy emphasises process modelling, demonstrating how writers generate, select, and refine their language choices. This shift aligns with the wider movement towards process-oriented writing instruction that values drafting, peer feedback, and revision as essential components of developing writing competence.

## Translation as a Pedagogical Tool

### The Rehabilitation of Translation

For much of the twentieth century, translation was marginalised in MFL pedagogy, associated with the discredited grammar-translation method that prioritised accuracy over communication. However, recent scholarship has rehabilitated translation as a valuable pedagogical tool when used purposefully and appropriately. The University of York's Language-Driven Pedagogy Review (2023) explicitly recommends that "pupils should be taught to pay attention to the detail of meaning through translation."

Translation tasks require pupils to engage deeply with both the source and target languages, developing metalinguistic awareness and grammatical precision. Unlike free composition, where pupils might avoid structures they find challenging, translation obliges them to grapple with specific linguistic features.

### Types of Translation Activities

**Close Translation** involves rendering a text from the target language into English (or vice versa) with attention to precise meaning. This develops reading comprehension and vocabulary recall while making pupils conscious of structural differences between languages. For example, translating a French text containing multiple past tenses (passé composé, imparfait, plus-que-parfait) requires pupils to understand the semantic nuances that distinguish these forms.

**Selective Translation** focuses on specific linguistic features rather than whole-text rendering. Pupils might translate only the verb phrases from a passage, or only the adjectival constructions. This targeted approach isolates particular grammar points for concentrated attention.

**Mediation Tasks** require pupils to convey information from a source text in the target language, but with freedom to adapt, summarise, or restructure. This resembles real-world translation scenarios where fidelity to the source must be balanced against appropriateness for the target audience.

**Reverse Translation** involves pupils translating a text from English into the target language, then comparing their version with an expert translation. This develops self-monitoring skills and raises awareness of translation choices.

### The Role of L1 in MFL Writing

The relationship between a pupil's first language and their developing second language writing is complex. Cummins' (1979) Interdependence Hypothesis suggests that literacy skills developed in the L1 can transfer to the L2, providing a foundation for written production. Strategic use of the L1 through translation activities can therefore support rather than hinder MFL development.

Research on multilingual approaches in language education recommends introducing "simple activities like translation exercises or bilingual discussions before moving to more complex strategies" (MFL Central, 2025). This acknowledges that the L1 remains a resource that pupils can deploy strategically, particularly when grappling with abstract grammatical concepts.

### Critical Considerations

While translation offers pedagogical benefits, it should complement rather than dominate writing instruction. The Communicative Approach insight—that language is for communication, not merely linguistic analysis—remains valid. Translation works best when integrated with opportunities for authentic, meaningful writing.

Moreover, translation tasks must be carefully designed. Poorly constructed exercises might reinforce unhelpful word-for-word translation habits rather than developing genuine communicative competence. Effective translation tasks focus on meaning equivalence rather than literal correspondence, requiring pupils to consider how the same communicative effect might be achieved through different linguistic means.

## Spontaneous Writing: Developing Independence

### Defining Spontaneous Writing

Spontaneous writing refers to unplanned, unrehearsed production of text in the target language. Unlike scaffolded or modelled writing, spontaneous tasks require pupils to draw on their internalised linguistic resources without external support. As Teach Secondary notes, activities designed to "encourage pupils to write more spontaneously on any subject they are given" develop the flexibility and confidence needed for authentic communication (Teach Secondary, 2024).

The development of spontaneous writing capacity represents the ultimate goal of MFL writing instruction. GCSE assessments require pupils to write independently in response to unseen prompts, demonstrating that they have internalised sufficient linguistic resources to communicate without reliance on prepared or memorised material.

### The Path to Spontaneity

Spontaneous writing does not emerge spontaneously—it must be carefully cultivated through progressive pedagogical approaches. The progression might follow this trajectory:

**Controlled Spontaneity**: Pupils write on an unpredicted topic but with access to reference materials (vocabulary lists, verb tables, grammar notes). This develops the skill of selecting and deploying resources under time pressure.

**Semi-Spontaneous Production**: Pupils write without reference materials but following a familiar topic and text type. The content is unprescribed, but the genre conventions provide implicit structure.

**Fully Spontaneous Writing**: Pupils respond to unexpected prompts without scaffolding or preparation, drawing entirely on internalised knowledge.

The Everyday MFL blog emphasises the importance of regular opportunities for spontaneous production, noting that "spontaneous speech" (and by extension writing) activities help pupils develop the flexibility to generate language in real-time communicative situations.

### Strategies for Developing Spontaneous Writing

**Speed Writing** involves timed exercises where pupils write as much as they can on a given topic within a short timeframe (e.g., five minutes). This reduces the temptation to over-plan or rely on reference materials, encouraging fluency over accuracy—though subsequent editing can address accuracy issues.

**Random Word Tasks** provide pupils with a set of unrelated vocabulary items and challenge them to incorporate all of them into a coherent text. As Teach Secondary describes, "the words they are given can be completely random if you are doing this for fun or from a certain topic area" (2024). This develops creative problem-solving and flexibility.

**Creative Constraints** impose arbitrary limitations that force linguistic creativity: write a story using only the present tense; describe your weekend without using the first person; write a restaurant review using exactly five sentences.

**Unplanned Response** involves interrupting a lesson with an unexpected writing prompt: "You have ten minutes to write a letter of complaint to the hotel where you stayed on holiday." This simulates the unpredictability of real-world communication.

### Assessment of Spontaneous Writing

Assessing spontaneous writing requires different criteria than scaffolded tasks. While accuracy remains important, greater weight should be given to:
- **Fluency**: The ability to produce extended text without undue hesitation
- **Range**: The variety of vocabulary and structures deployed
- **Coherence**: The logical organisation of ideas
- **Appropriateness**: The match between language choices and communicative context

The GCSE MFL specifications (AQA and Edexcel, 2024) assess writing through tasks that require spontaneous production. Understanding the assessment criteria for these examinations should inform classroom practice, ensuring that pupils develop the specific competencies that will be tested.

### Balancing Accuracy and Fluency

A persistent tension in spontaneous writing instruction concerns the relationship between accuracy and fluency. Premature focus on accuracy can inhibit risk-taking and creativity, as pupils restrict themselves to language they are confident of producing correctly. Conversely, exclusive focus on fluency may allow fossilisation of errors.

The solution lies in distinguishing between accuracy-focused and fluency-focused activities. Scaffolded and modelled writing provide contexts for accuracy development; spontaneous writing tasks prioritise communicative effectiveness, with accuracy addressed through subsequent editing and feedback.

## Progression in Writing Across Key Stages

### Key Stage 2 Foundations

The National Curriculum for MFL at Key Stage 2 emphasises exposure to written language and simple written production. Pupils should be taught to "write phrases from memory, and adapt these to create new sentences" (DfE, 2013). Writing at this stage is typically:
- **Sentence-level**: Pupils write single sentences or short sequences
- **Highly scaffolded**: Frames, vocabulary banks, and models provide extensive support
- **Accuracy-focused**: Attention to spelling, accents, and basic agreement

The primary MFL guidance from the National College emphasises that writing frames and visual supports are particularly important for primary learners, enabling them to produce language beyond their independent capability (National College, 2023).

### Key Stage 3 Development

Key Stage 3 represents the crucial bridge between primary foundations and GCSE requirements. The National Curriculum requires pupils to "write prose using an increasingly wide range of grammar and vocabulary" and to "write creatively to express their own ideas and opinions" (DfE, 2013).

Writing development at this stage should focus on:
- **Text-level competence**: Moving from sentence to paragraph and text-level production
- **Genre awareness**: Understanding different text types (emails, letters, articles, stories) and their conventions
- **Increasing independence**: Gradual reduction of scaffolding as proficiency develops
- **Grammatical range**: Introduction and consolidation of more
