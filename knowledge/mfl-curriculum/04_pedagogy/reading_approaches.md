# Reading Approaches in Modern Foreign Languages

## Overview

Reading in the modern foreign languages (MFL) classroom serves multiple purposes: it is a mechanism for vocabulary acquisition, a means of introducing new language structures, a vehicle for cultural understanding, and ultimately a skill that pupils must develop for success at GCSE and beyond. The Ofsted research review for languages (2021) emphasises that reading should not be treated as a mere comprehension exercise but as a core component of language acquisition that supports the development of pupils' linguistic knowledge and cultural awareness.

The DfE MFL Pedagogy Pilot (2016–2018) demonstrated that systematic approaches to reading, combined with explicit phonics instruction, significantly improve pupil outcomes. This knowledge base entry examines the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of reading approaches in MFL, with particular attention to extensive and intensive reading, the use of graded readers, and decoding strategies.

## Extensive Reading in MFL

### Theoretical Foundations

Extensive reading is an approach that prioritises reading large quantities of text for pleasure and general understanding, with minimal use of dictionaries and minimal focus on linguistic analysis. The theoretical foundation for extensive reading draws heavily from Stephen Krashen's Input Hypothesis, which posits that language acquisition occurs when learners are exposed to comprehensible input—that is, language that is slightly beyond their current level (i + 1).

Krashen (1985) argues that "we acquire vocabulary and spelling by reading" and that extensive exposure to meaningful, context-rich texts is more effective for long-term language acquisition than explicit vocabulary instruction alone. In the MFL context, this means providing pupils with access to texts that they can understand with minimal support, allowing them to focus on meaning rather than form.

### Implementation Strategies

#### The Free Voluntary Reading Model

Free voluntary reading (FVR), sometimes called sustained silent reading, involves pupils reading self-selected texts of their choice for a set period of time. In the MFL classroom, this requires:

- **A well-stocked classroom library** with texts at various proficiency levels
- **Time allocated regularly** (typically 10–15 minutes per lesson or a dedicated session weekly)
- **No comprehension checks or tests** that might transform the activity into a chore
- **Teacher modelling** where teachers read alongside pupils

The Extensive Reading Foundation recommends that pupils should read at least one book every two weeks at the appropriate level, with the goal of reading at least one million words per academic year for significant vocabulary gains.

#### Creating an Extensive Reading Environment

Successful extensive reading programmes in MFL departments require careful planning:

**Text Selection and Grading:** Texts must be genuinely comprehensible. Research suggests that learners should know at least 95–98% of the vocabulary in a text to read extensively without excessive dictionary use. For French, Spanish, and German, this typically means beginning with texts written specifically for language learners.

**Tracking and Motivation:** While extensive reading should not be tested, many departments find success with reading journals, book reviews in the target language, or simple tracking systems where pupils record what they have read. The focus should remain on enjoyment and completion rather than linguistic accuracy.

**Integration with the Curriculum:** Extensive reading should complement rather than replace the core curriculum. Some departments allocate one lesson per fortnight to extensive reading, while others build it into homework expectations.

### Benefits of Extensive Reading

The research evidence for extensive reading is compelling:

**Vocabulary Acquisition:** Studies consistently show that extensive reading leads to significant vocabulary gains. Nation (2001) estimates that learners can acquire between 5–15 words per hour of extensive reading, depending on text difficulty and learner proficiency.

**Grammar Development:** Through repeated exposure to grammatical structures in meaningful contexts, pupils develop implicit knowledge of how the language works. This "pattern recognition" supports both comprehension and production.

**Reading Fluency:** Extensive reading improves reading speed and reduces the cognitive load associated with decoding, allowing pupils to focus on meaning rather than form.

**Motivation and Attitudes:** Pupils who read extensively generally develop more positive attitudes toward the target language and culture. The ability to read and enjoy a whole book in another language provides a significant sense of achievement.

**Cultural Knowledge:** Extensive reading exposes pupils to cultural perspectives, daily life, and social practices in target language communities, supporting the development of intercultural understanding required by the national curriculum.

### Challenges in UK Secondary Contexts

Despite the benefits, implementing extensive reading in UK secondary schools presents challenges:

**Resource Constraints:** Building an extensive reading library requires significant investment. Graded readers cost £5–£10 each, and a viable collection requires several hundred titles across proficiency levels.

**Time Pressures:** The GCSE specification and examination pressures can make it difficult to justify time spent on reading that is not directly assessed. Departments must be clear about the long-term benefits for language proficiency.

**Pupil Resistance:** Some pupils, particularly those who do not enjoy reading in English, may resist extensive reading in the target language. Success requires careful introduction, appropriate text selection, and patience as habits develop.

**Assessment Culture:** The UK educational system's emphasis on measurable outcomes can conflict with the philosophy of extensive reading, which prioritises process over product.

## Intensive Reading in MFL

### Definition and Purpose

Intensive reading involves detailed analysis of shorter texts, with explicit focus on vocabulary, grammar, and comprehension. Unlike extensive reading, which prioritises quantity and fluency, intensive reading prioritises depth of understanding and linguistic analysis.

In the MFL classroom, intensive reading serves several functions:
- **Introducing new language:** Texts can contextualise new vocabulary and grammatical structures
- **Developing reading strategies:** Pupils learn to identify cognates, use context clues, and infer meaning
- **Exam preparation:** GCSE reading examinations require careful analysis of authentic texts
- **Cultural exploration:** Intensive reading allows detailed examination of cultural content

### The Pre-During-Post Framework

Effective intensive reading lessons typically follow a structured sequence:

#### Pre-Reading Activities

Pre-reading activities activate prior knowledge, pre-teach essential vocabulary, and establish purpose for reading:

**Vocabulary Priming:** Rather than providing lists of translated words, effective teachers use images, actions, and context to establish meaning of key vocabulary that will support comprehension.

**Prediction Activities:** Using titles, images, or initial sentences, pupils predict content before reading. This activates background knowledge and creates anticipation.

**Knowledge Activation:** For texts on specific topics (e.g., French cuisine, German environmental policy), teachers may use discussion, video clips, or mind maps to activate what pupils already know.

#### During-Reading Activities

During-reading activities support comprehension and strategy development:

**Guided Reading:** Teachers read aloud or use audio recordings while pupils follow the text, modelling pronunciation and intonation. This supports the development of sound-spelling correspondences.

**Comprehension Monitoring:** Pupils pause at predetermined points to check understanding, answer questions, or summarise content. This develops metacognitive awareness of the reading process.

**Strategic Support:** Teachers explicitly teach and model strategies such as:
- Identifying cognates and word families
- Using context to infer unknown word meanings
- Recognising text organisation (headings, paragraphs, signposting language)
- Skimming for gist and scanning for specific information

#### Post-Reading Activities

Post-reading activities consolidate learning and extend thinking:

**Linguistic Analysis:** Pupils examine how specific grammatical structures function in the text, identify patterns, and consider how they might use similar structures in their own writing.

**Vocabulary Consolidation:** Target vocabulary is reviewed and practised through various activities, ensuring that pupils can recognise and use new words productively.

**Critical Response:** Pupils respond to text content through discussion, writing, or creative tasks, developing their ability to express opinions and reactions in the target language.

**Text Analysis:** For higher-attaining pupils, analysis of writer's craft, register, and cultural assumptions deepens understanding and prepares for advanced study.

### Balancing Top-Down and Bottom-Up Processing

Effective intensive reading instruction balances two approaches:

**Top-Down Processing:** Readers use prior knowledge, context, and prediction to construct meaning. This approach emphasises understanding the gist and main ideas before focusing on details.

**Bottom-Up Processing:** Readers decode individual words and grammatical structures to build meaning. This approach emphasises accurate decoding and vocabulary knowledge.

The Ofsted research review (2021) notes that less proficient readers tend to rely heavily on bottom-up processing, struggling to see the "big picture" while focusing on individual words. Effective instruction supports the development of both approaches, with explicit teaching of decoding strategies while also building the confidence to tolerate ambiguity and infer meaning.

### Intensive Reading and GCSE Preparation

The reformed GCSE MFL specifications (introduced for first teaching in 2016) place significant demands on reading comprehension. The Cambridge Assessment review (2018) found that "not dumbing down but stimulating up" was necessary, with examination texts becoming more challenging and authentic.

Intensive reading instruction must prepare pupils for:
- **Multiple-choice comprehension questions** requiring careful reading
- **True/false/not in text questions** demanding precise understanding
- **Translation tasks** requiring accurate decoding and encoding
- **Inference and reading between the lines** for higher-tariff questions

The specification requires pupils to read texts from various contexts (identity and culture, local/national/international areas of interest, current and future study and employment), making exposure to diverse text types essential.

## Graded Readers in MFL

### What Are Graded Readers?

Graded readers (also called language learner literature or easy readers) are books specifically written or adapted for language learners. They are "graded" according to controlled vocabulary, simplified grammar, and reduced length, making them accessible to learners at different proficiency levels.

The Extensive Reading Foundation defines graded readers as "books of various genres that are specially created for learners of foreign languages. They may be simplified versions of existing works, original stories, or books that are factual in nature."

### Levelling Systems

Different publishers use various levelling systems, but most follow similar principles:

**Beginner/Elementary Level:**
- Vocabulary of 300–600 headwords
- Present tense predominance
- Short sentences (5–8 words average)
- High-frequency vocabulary only
- Strong visual support

**Pre-Intermediate Level:**
- Vocabulary of 600–1,200 headwords
- Introduction of past tenses
- Slightly more complex sentences
- Reduced visual support
- Longer texts (10,000–20,000 words)

**Intermediate Level:**
- Vocabulary of 1,200–1,700 headwords
- Full range of common tenses
- Longer, more complex sentences
- Minimal visual support
- Approaching authentic text complexity

**Upper-Intermediate/Advanced Level:**
- Vocabulary of 1,700–2,500+ headwords
- Complex grammatical structures
- Sustained texts of novel length
- Approaching original literature complexity

### Major Graded Reader Series for MFL

Several publishers produce graded readers suitable for UK secondary schools:

**CIEL / CIDEB (French, Spanish, German, Italian):**
The "Lectures" and "Lektüre" series offer classic and original stories at various levels with audio support, comprehension activities, and cultural notes.

**Oxford Bookworms (various languages):**
The library includes simplified classics and original stories with supporting materials and audio recordings.

**A1–C2 Series (various publishers):**
Many publishers now align graded readers with the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR), making it easier to match texts to pupil proficiency.

**Publisher-Specific Series:**
- **Klett** (German): "Lektüren" series with comprehensive teacher resources
- **Anaya** (Spanish): "Leer en español" series with cultural focus
- **Hatier** (French): "Classiques & Cie" with literary focus

### Effective Use of Graded Readers

#### Classroom Libraries

Successful extensive reading programmes require carefully organised classroom libraries:

**Level Organisation:** Books should be clearly labelled by level, with systems for pupils to self-select appropriately. Colour-coding by level helps pupils navigate choices.

**Genre Variety:** Collections should include adventure, romance, mystery, science fiction, biography, and non-fiction to appeal to diverse interests.

**Cultural Representation:** Readers should represent diverse target-language cultures—not just metropolitan France/Spain/Germany but also Francophone, Hispanophone, and Germanophone communities worldwide.

**Regular Refreshment:** Collections should be updated regularly to maintain interest and reflect contemporary themes.

#### Integrating Graded Readers into Teaching

While graded readers are primarily for independent extensive reading, they can support classroom teaching:

**Class Sets:** Some departments purchase class sets of specific titles for whole-class study, using them as stepping stones to authentic literature.

**Book Clubs:** Small groups read the same title and discuss it, developing both reading and speaking skills.

**Film Adaptations:** Many graded readers are based on films or have film adaptations, allowing comparison activities.

**Cross-Curricular Links:** Historical graded readers can support history topics; scientific readers can support science curriculum.

### Research Evidence for Graded Readers

The research evidence supporting graded readers is substantial:

**Macalister (2015)** found that extensive reading of graded readers led to significant vocabulary gains and improved reading comprehension.

**Nation (2001)** argues that graded readers are essential for the early stages of language learning, providing the comprehensible input necessary for acquisition.

**Waring and Takahashi (2000)** demonstrated that extensive reading of graded readers improved not only reading proficiency but also writing, grammar, and listening skills.

For UK secondary contexts, where pupils typically have limited exposure to the target language outside the classroom, graded readers provide essential input that supports all aspects of language development.

## Decoding Strategies in MFL Reading

### The Importance of Phonics in MFL

The DfE MFL Pedagogy Pilot (2016–2018) established systematic phonics instruction as one of the pillars of effective MFL teaching. The pilot found that "systematic phonics instruction improved decoding, pronunciation, and spelling" across French, German, and Spanish.

The Ofsted research review (2021) notes that "pupils need to gain systematic knowledge of the vocabulary, grammar, and sound and spelling systems (phonics) of their new language." This phonics knowledge is essential for successful reading, enabling pupils to decode unfamiliar words accurately.

### Sound-Spelling Correspondences

Each target language has distinct sound-spelling systems that pupils must learn:

#### French Phonics

French presents particular challenges due to:
- **Silent letters:** Final consonants (except c, r, f, l—the "CaReFuL" rule) are typically silent
- **Liaison:** Silent letters may be pronounced in connected speech
- **Nasal vowels:** Distinctive nasal sounds represented by various spellings (an, en, on, in, un)
- **Accents:** Diacritical marks that change pronunciation and meaning (é, è, ê, ç)

Key correspondences to teach explicitly:
- eu/œu = /ø/ or /œ/ (e.g., *feu*, *sœur*)
- ou = /u/ (e.g., *vous*)
- ch = /ʃ/ (e.g., *chat*)
- gn = /ɲ/ (e.g., *montagne*)
- ill = /ij/ (e.g., *fille*)

#### Spanish Phonics

Spanish is relatively phonetic, with consistent sound-spelling correspondences:
- **Vowels:** Five pure vowel sounds (a, e, i, o, u)
- **Consonants:** Generally consistent, though c and g vary before e/i
- **Digraphs:** ch, ll, rr (though ch and ll are no longer considered separate letters)
- **Stress rules:** Predictable stress patterns with written accents marking exceptions

Key correspondences to teach explicitly:
- c before a/o/u = /k/ (e.g., *casa*); before e/i = /θ/ (Spain) or /s/ (Latin America)
- g before a/o/u = /g/ (e.g., *gato*); before e/i = /x/ (e.g., *general*)
- j = /x/ (e.g., *jamón*)
- ñ = /ɲ/ (e.g., *niño*)
- h = always silent (e.g., *hola*)

#### German Phonics

German has consistent sound-spelling correspondences but distinctive features:
- **Umlauts:** ä, ö, ü modify vowel sounds
- **Eszett:** ß represents /s/ sound after long vowels
- **Consonant clusters:** German tolerates complex clusters (e.g., *Straße*, *Schlacht*)
- **Final devoicing:** Voiced consonants become voiceless at word end

Key correspondences to teach explicitly:
- w = /v/ (e.g., *Wasser*)
- v = /f/ (e.g., *Vater*)
- z = /ts/ (e.g., *Zeit*)
- ch after a/o/u = /x/; after other vowels = /ç/
- sch = /ʃ/ (e.g., *Schule*)
- ei = /aɪ/ (e.g., *mein*); ie = /iː/ (e.g., *sie*)

### Teaching Decoding Strategies

#### Systematic Phonics Instruction

The DfE MFL Pedagogy Pilot recommends systematic phonics instruction following principles similar to English phonics programmes:

**Explicit Teaching:** Sound-spelling correspondences should be taught explicitly and systematically, not left to incidental learning.

**Multi-Sensory Approaches:** Combining visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic elements supports memory and application. This might include:
- Seeing the letter combination
- Hearing the sound modelled
- Saying the sound aloud
- Physical actions to associate with sounds

**Spaced Practice:** Regular, distributed practice of phonics knowledge is more effective than massed practice. Five minutes per lesson is more effective than 30 minutes once a week.

**Application to Reading:** Phonics instruction must be immediately applied to reading words and texts, not taught in isolation
#### Decoding Strategies for Pupils

Pupils should be explicitly taught strategies for tackling unfamiliar words:

**Syllable Division:** Breaking words into syllables makes decoding more manageable. For example, "comprender" → com-pren-der. This is particularly important for German with its long compound words.

**Looking for Word Parts:** Identifying prefixes, roots, and suffixes supports decoding and meaning construction. For example, "incompréhensible" → in-compréhens-ible (not-understand-able).

**Using Cognates:** Recognising cognates (words that are similar in English and the target language) supports both decoding and comprehension. For example, "information" in French/Spanish/German is recognisable to English speakers.

**Sounding Out:** When other strategies fail, sounding out using known sound-spelling correspondences is the final strategy. This requires secure phonics knowledge.

### Differentiation for Different Abilities

Decoding instruction must be differentiated for pupils with varying needs:

**For Struggling Readers:**
- Additional phonics support in small groups
- High-frequency word practice to build automaticity
- Texts with strong visual support
- Pre-teaching of challenging vocabulary before reading

**For Advanced Readers:**
- Exposure to authentic texts with less common vocabulary
- Focus on complex sound-spelling patterns
- Development of inference skills at the word level
- Independent research using target language sources

## Integrating Reading Approaches in the Curriculum

### A Balanced Approach

Effective MFL curricula balance extensive and intensive reading appropriately:

**Key Stage 3:** Emphasis on building reading fluency through extensive reading with graded readers, supplemented by intensive reading of carefully selected texts to introduce new language.

**Key Stage 4:** Increased focus on intensive reading of authentic and semi-authentic texts to prepare for GCSE, while maintaining some extensive reading to support vocabulary acquisition and motivation.

### Sequencing Reading Skills

Reading skills should be sequenced systematically across the key stages:

**Year 7:** Focus on phonics, decoding, and basic comprehension. Extensive reading at beginner level.

**Year 8:** Development of inference skills, recognition of text organisation, and introduction to more complex authentic texts.

**Year 9:** Preparation for GCSE-style tasks, exposure to more demanding authentic texts, sustained extensive reading.

**Years 10–11:** Mastery of GCSE reading tasks, independent research using target language sources, extensive reading at appropriate levels.

### Cross-Referencing with Other Language Skills

Reading should not be taught in isolation but integrated with other skills:

**Listening:** Audio recordings of texts support the development of sound-spelling correspondences and listening comprehension simultaneously.

**Speaking:** Reading aloud develops pronunciation and fluency. Discussing texts develops oral interaction skills.

**Writing:** Exposure to model texts through reading supports writing development. Pupils absorb structures, vocabulary, and organisational patterns.

**Translation:** The new GCSE specifications require translation both ways. Reading develops the decoding skills necessary for translation into English, while exposure to English texts in translation supports translation into the target language.

## Assessment of Reading in MFL

### Formative Assessment

Effective formative assessment of reading includes:

**Running Records:** Recording pupils reading aloud to assess decoding accuracy and fluency.

**Comprehension Checks:** Quick checks for understanding during reading, using thumbs up/down or brief written responses.

**Reading Journals:** Pupils record what they have read and their responses, providing insight into reading habits and preferences.

**Self-Assessment:** Pupils assess their own reading strategies and set goals for improvement.

### Summative Assessment

Summative assessment of reading should mirror GCSE requirements:

**Authentic Texts:** Use of real or realistic texts from target language sources.

**Varied Question Types:** Multiple choice, true/false/not in text, short answer, and extended response questions.

**Translation:** Regular translation practice both ways, as required by the GCSE specification.

**Literary Texts:** Some assessment of response to literary texts, which is required at GCSE.

## Key Considerations for MFL Teachers

### Text Selection Criteria

When selecting texts for reading instruction, consider:

**Comprehensibility:** Texts should be at an appropriate level—challenging but not overwhelming.

**Interest:** Texts should engage pupils' interest and relate to their lives and experiences where possible.

**Cultural Authenticity:** Texts should provide insight into target language cultures, not just language practice.

**Linguistic Value:** Texts should contain useful vocabulary and structures that pupils can transfer to their own language use.

### Creating a Reading Culture

Successful MFL departments foster a culture of reading:

**Modelling:** Teachers model enthusiasm for reading and share their own reading experiences.

**Visibility:** Reading materials are prominently displayed and easily accessible.

**Celebration:** Reading achievements are celebrated, whether completing a book, improving fluency, or making interesting discoveries.

**Integration:** Reading is integrated into the life of the department, not treated as an add-on.

### Supporting Struggling Readers

Some pupils will struggle with reading in MFL, particularly those with dyslexia or other literacy difficulties:

**Early Identification:** Regular assessment identifies pupils who need additional support.

**Phonics Reinforcement:** Additional phonics instruction for pupils who need it.

**Modified Materials:** Texts in larger font, with more visual support, or at lower levels.

**Technology Support:** Text-to-speech software, reading apps, and other technological supports.

**Alternative Formats:** Audio books, graphic novels, and other formats that reduce decoding demands.

## Research Summary and Recommendations

### Key Research Findings

The evidence base for reading in MFL supports several key conclusions:

1. **Extensive reading is highly effective** for vocabulary acquisition, grammar development, and motivation (Krashen, 1985; Nation, 2001; Macalister, 2015).

2. **Systematic phonics instruction** improves decoding, pronunciation, and spelling (DfE MFL Pedagogy Pilot, 2016–2018).

3. **Graded readers provide essential comprehensible input** for learners at all levels (Extensive Reading Foundation; Nation, 2001).

4. **Balanced instruction** combining extensive and intensive reading produces the best outcomes (Ofsted Research Review, 2021).

5. **Integration with other skills** supports overall language development (Language-Driven Pedagogy, University of York).

### Recommendations for Departmental Practice

Based on the research evidence, MFL departments should:

1. **Invest in extensive reading libraries** with graded readers at various levels.

2. **Allocate regular time for extensive reading** (minimum 10–15 minutes per week, ideally more).

3. **Implement systematic phonics instruction** from Year 7, following the principles of the DfE MFL Pedagogy Pilot.

4. **Use the pre-during-post framework** for intensive reading lessons.

5. **Balance top-down and bottom-up processing** in reading instruction.

6. **Select texts carefully** considering comprehensibility, interest, cultural authenticity, and linguistic value.

7. **Integrate reading with other skills** rather than teaching it in isolation.

8. **Foster a departmental culture** that celebrates and values reading.

9. **Provide additional support** for struggling readers, including modified materials and technology.

10. **Assess formatively** to track progress and identify pupils needing support.

## Conclusion

Reading is fundamental to language acquisition and a core skill that pupils must develop for success in MFL. A balanced approach combining extensive reading for fluency, vocabulary, and motivation with intensive reading for skill development and examination preparation provides the foundation for successful language learning.

The integration of systematic phonics instruction, careful text selection, and a supportive departmental culture creates the conditions for pupils to develop as confident, competent readers in the target language. While challenges exist—particularly around resources and time pressures—the research evidence is clear: investing in reading pays dividends in pupil outcomes.

As the Ofsted research review (2021) concludes, pupils who read extensively and with good instruction develop not only stronger reading skills but also broader vocabulary, better grammar, and more positive attitudes toward language learning. These benefits extend far beyond the MFL classroom, supporting pupils' academic achievement and opening doors to intercultural understanding that will serve them throughout their lives.
