# Speaking and Communication in MFL Pedagogy

## Overview

Speaking lies at the heart of Modern Foreign Language (MFL) education. It is the skill that pupils most closely associate with "knowing" a language, and research consistently demonstrates that productive oral competence drives deeper language acquisition than receptive skills alone. This knowledge file examines the theoretical foundations of spoken communication in MFL, practical classroom strategies for developing oral proficiency, and the pedagogical progression from controlled rehearsal to genuine spontaneity.

## Theoretical Foundations: Communicative Competence

### The Canale and Swain Framework (1980)

The foundational model for understanding communicative competence in language teaching was established by Michael Canale and Merrill Swain in their seminal 1980 paper "Theoretical Bases of Communicative Approaches to Second Language Teaching and Testing." Their framework identifies four interconnected components that underpin all effective spoken communication:

**Grammatical Competence**
This encompasses mastery of linguistic codes—including vocabulary, morphology, syntax, phonology, and orthography. Without sufficient grammatical competence, learners cannot construct intelligible utterances regardless of their communicative intent. In the MFL classroom, this competence develops through explicit instruction, controlled practice, and gradual automatisation.

**Sociolinguistic Competence**
Language exists within social contexts. Sociolinguistic competence involves understanding the appropriate use of language across different situations, including sensitivity to register, formality, dialect variation, and cultural norms. A pupil who greets a peer with "Comment vas-tu?" but addresses the headteacher identically has not yet developed full sociolinguistic competence. Teachers must explicitly model and practise appropriate variations.

**Discourse Competence**
Beyond individual sentences, discourse competence enables learners to connect utterances coherently, managing turn-taking, opening and closing exchanges, and maintaining thematic coherence across extended interaction. This competence proves particularly challenging for English-speaking learners of languages with different conversational conventions—such as German's more direct turn-taking or Spanish's overlapping speech patterns.

**Strategic Competence**
When communication breaks down—through insufficient vocabulary, grammatical uncertainty, or processing difficulties—strategic competence provides repair mechanisms. These include paraphrasing, circumlocution, requesting clarification, switching to a shared language temporarily, or using non-verbal communication. Explicitly teaching these strategies empowers learners to maintain interaction rather than abandoning communication attempts.

### Swain's Comprehensible Output Hypothesis

Building upon Krashen's influential Input Hypothesis, which emphasised comprehensible input as the driver of language acquisition, Merrill Swain proposed the Comprehensible Output Hypothesis based on her extensive research into Canadian French immersion programmes. Swain observed that students who received years of comprehensible input nevertheless failed to achieve native-like grammatical accuracy. She concluded that output—particularly spoken production—plays three critical functions in language development:

**The Noticing Function**
When learners attempt to produce language, they become consciously aware of gaps in their knowledge. A pupil who cannot retrieve the correct past tense form while describing weekend activities notices precisely what they need to learn. This noticing triggers attention to relevant input and motivates subsequent learning.

**The Hypothesis-Testing Function**
Every utterance represents a hypothesis about how the language works. Through spoken production, learners test these hypotheses and receive feedback—either explicit correction or implicit evidence from interlocutors' responses. Successful hypotheses are reinforced; unsuccessful ones are revised.

**The Metalinguistic Function**
Reflecting on one's own output, particularly when producing language for an audience, encourages learners to analyse linguistic forms explicitly. This metalinguistic awareness accelerates the transition from implicit knowledge to explicit understanding that can be deliberately applied.

The implications for MFL pedagogy are profound: classrooms must prioritise meaningful speaking opportunities, not merely as performance demonstrations but as genuine sites of language development.

## From Scripted to Spontaneous: The Pedagogical Progression

### Understanding the Continuum

Spoken communication in MFL exists along a continuum from fully scripted to completely spontaneous. Recognising this continuum helps teachers design appropriate activities for different developmental stages:

**Fully Scripted Communication**
Learners reproduce memorised texts—songs, poems, dialogues—where every word is predetermined. While sometimes dismissed as "inauthentic," scripted activities serve crucial functions: they build phonological confidence, automatise high-frequency phrases, and provide safe rehearsal spaces for anxious learners.

**Semi-Scripted Communication**
Learners manipulate memorised chunks within predetermined frameworks. Using substitution tables, sentence builders, or writing frames, pupils construct personally relevant utterances from provided elements. This "controlled creativity" bridges the gap between pure memorisation and independent production.

**Guided Communication**
Learners respond to structured prompts—photographs, question sequences, information-gap activities—using vocabulary and structures they have studied but without predetermined utterances. The GCSE photo card and role-play tasks exemplify this level, requiring pupils to apply known language to unpredictable scenarios.

**Spontaneous Communication**
Learners engage in genuine interaction where neither content nor language is predetermined. They initiate topics, respond to unexpected contributions, negotiate meaning, and repair communication breakdowns in real-time. This represents the ultimate goal of MFL education but requires substantial scaffolding to achieve.

### The Role of Rehearsal

Rehearsal occupies a contested position in MFL pedagogy. Critics argue that over-rehearsed performances create false impressions of competence—pupils who deliver elaborate presentations cannot necessarily order lunch. However, research into skill acquisition and performance anxiety suggests that strategic rehearsal, properly understood, facilitates rather than impedes spontaneous communication.

**Building Automaticity**
Fluent spontaneous speech requires substantial automaticity. When working memory dedicates resources to retrieving basic vocabulary or constructing simple grammatical structures, little capacity remains for message formulation. Rehearsal moves frequently-needed language into procedural memory, freeing cognitive resources for genuine communication.

**Developing Phonological Confidence**
Pronunciation anxiety frequently inhibits participation. Rehearsed choral drilling, individual repetition, and shadowing activities build phonological confidence without the pressure of simultaneous message construction. Once pronunciation feels manageable, learners become willing to attempt spontaneous speech.

**Scaffolding Performance**
Rehearsal provides a performance safety net. Knowing they have practised key phrases reduces anxiety and encourages risk-taking. The crucial pedagogical distinction lies between rehearsing *for* performance (memorising a fixed script) and rehearsing *elements* that can be flexibly deployed across contexts.

### Strategies for Developing Spontaneity

**Structured Spontaneity Activities**
Design activities that require unpredictable responses within familiar frameworks. "Trapdoor" games, where partners choose secretly which option to delete, create genuine information gaps. "Find someone who..." surveys require spontaneous questioning and personalised responses while limiting linguistic demands.

**Routine Target Language Use**
Establish classroom routines conducted entirely in the target language. Taking the register, giving instructions, discussing the weather, and managing transitions become opportunities for spontaneous interaction. Pupils internalise these high-frequency exchanges, building confidence for more complex communication.

**Thinking Time and Planning**
Spontaneity does not mean instant production. Authentic conversation includes pauses, reformulation, and planning. Providing thinking time—through "think-pair-share" structures, written planning before speaking, or recorded responses—scaffolds spontaneity without undermining authenticity.

**Partial Information Activities**
Design tasks where neither participant possesses complete information. Jigsaw readings, different photographs, complementary timetables—such activities create genuine communicative necessity. Learners must speak to complete the task, and partners' responses are genuinely unpredictable.

## Classroom Strategies for Speaking Development

### The Place of Drilling and Repetition

Despite association with outdated behaviourist methodologies, drilling and repetition remain essential components of effective MFL pedagogy when used appropriately. Steve Smith, author of *Becoming an Outstanding Languages Teacher*, advocates for strategic drilling that builds automaticity without sacrificing meaning.

**Choral Repetition**
Whole-class choral repetition builds confidence through safety in numbers. Varying delivery—whispering, shouting, singing, robot voices—maintains engagement while developing phonological memory. Teachers should model natural rhythm and intonation, not robotic articulation.

**Individual and Small-Group Repetition**
Following choral work, individual and small-group repetition provides diagnostic information. Teachers identify pronunciation difficulties and offer targeted support. Row-by-row, half-class, and pair formats bridge between whole-class security and individual accountability.

**Meaningful Drilling**
Effective drills embed repetition within meaningful contexts. Rather than isolated sentence repetition, use question-answer sequences, true/false personalisation, and picture-based drills where learners genuinely process meaning while practising form.

### Pair and Group Work Strategies

**Simultaneous Pair Work**
When all pupils speak simultaneously, individual practice time multiplies dramatically. A five-minute pair-work activity provides each pupil with substantially more speaking time than teacher-led questioning permits. Classroom management challenges—monitoring, behaviour, noise—require explicit teaching of routines and expectations.

**Pair Work Dynamics**
Strategic pairing affects participation quality. Mixed-ability pairs provide models and support; same-ability pairs enable appropriate challenge. Rotating partners prevents over-familiarity and exposes pupils to diverse interlocutors. Consider pairing decisions carefully—shy pupils may dominate with quieter partners but withdraw with confident ones.

**Group Work Extensions**
Triads and small groups enable more complex interaction patterns: interviews, discussions, collaborative presentations, and role-plays with multiple characters. Groups require explicit structure—assigned roles, timed segments, clear success criteria—to prevent dominant pupils monopolising while others remain silent.

### Games and Communicative Activities

**Information Gap Games**
Activities where participants hold different essential information create genuine communicative necessity. Classic examples include "Battleships" (asking about grid locations), "Find the differences" (comparing similar pictures), and barrier games (one pupil describes, another draws). The information gap forces authentic interaction.

**Card and Board Games**
Adapted card games—Happy Families, Pelmanism, Top Trumps—provide repetitive practice within engaging formats. Board games with question cards, dice-based movement games, and competitive team activities increase motivation and participation. The game format reduces anxiety about "making mistakes" by reframing errors as learning opportunities.

**Drama and Role-Play**
Assumed roles liberate learners from self-consciousness about pronunciation errors or limited vocabulary. Pupils playing shopkeepers, doctors, or historical figures inhabit communicative contexts where target language use feels natural rather than artificial. Costume items, props, and designated performance spaces enhance authenticity.

## Assessment Frameworks: The GCSE Speaking Examination

### Current Assessment Structure

The GCSE MFL speaking examination, offered by AQA, Pearson Edexcel, and OCR, comprises three components assessing different aspects of oral competence:

**Role-Play (10 marks)**
This component assesses transactional communication in predictable contexts. Candidates respond to five prompts based on a scenario card—for example, asking for directions, making a complaint, or arranging to meet. The role-play tests functional language, appropriate register, and pronunciation within a controlled framework.

**Photo Card (24 marks)**
Candidates receive a photograph related to a topic theme and respond to five questions: two description questions, two opinion questions, and one unpredictable follow-up. This component tests description, narration, opinion-giving, and the ability to handle unexpected questions—closer to spontaneous communication than the role-play.

**General Conversation (36 marks)**
The most spontaneous component, the general conversation covers two themes (one prepared, one unprepared). Candidates respond to teacher-examiner questions, develop responses, ask questions, and maintain interaction. This component most closely approximates genuine communicative competence.

### Implications for Teaching

**Explicit Strategy Instruction**
The examination rewards specific communicative strategies: using question words to seek clarification, expressing uncertainty honestly, deploying repair strategies when stuck. Teachers should explicitly model and practise these examination skills alongside genuine communication development.

**Photo Card Preparation**
While the specific photograph is unpredictable, the question types follow consistent patterns. Teachers can develop generic frameworks for description (foreground/background, actions/appearance), opinion (advantages/disadvantages, personal experience), and speculation. These frameworks provide security without producing over-rehearsed scripts.

**Conversation Development**
Building genuine conversational competence requires extensive practice in asking as well as answering questions. Many pupils excel at responding to prompts but struggle to initiate or maintain interaction. Regular "question tennis" activities, where partners exchange questions on a topic, develop this bidirectional competence.

## Common Misconceptions and Challenges

### Pupil Misconceptions

**"I need perfect grammar before I can speak"**
Many pupils believe speaking requires complete accuracy and therefore avoid participation until they feel "ready." Teachers must explicitly model error-tolerant communication, celebrate attempted communication over perfect forms, and establish classroom cultures where errors are expected and useful.

**"Pronunciation must be perfect"**
Anxiety about sounding "silly" or "wrong" inhibits participation. Teachers should emphasise intelligibility over native-like accent, explicitly teach phonics to build confidence, and avoid exaggerated correction that increases self-consciousness.

**"Real conversation happens fast"**
Pupils compare their careful classroom production with fluent native speech and feel inadequate. Teachers should explicitly discuss processing time, self-correction, and the gap between receptive and productive competence as normal features of language learning.

### Teacher Challenges

**The Silent Period**
Some pupils experience extended silent periods during which they process input without producing output. This mirrors first language acquisition and should be respected rather than forced. Provide alternative participation methods—gesture, writing, choral response—while maintaining expectation of eventual oral participation.

**Differentiated Speaking Opportunities**
Mixed-ability classes present particular challenges for speaking activities. Open-ended tasks may leave less confident pupils silent while the articulate dominate. Structured tasks with assigned roles, sentence starters, and built-in support ensure universal participation while enabling extension for the more confident.

**Target Language Management**
Managing classroom behaviour, giving complex instructions, and responding to unexpected events in the target language demands considerable teacher fluency. Strategic use of English—for complex grammar explanations, pastoral conversations, or behavioural interventions—is pedagogically defensible. The goal is maximising target language use, not achieving impossible purity.

## Progression Across Key Stages

### Early Years and Key Stage 1

Young learners acquire spoken language through play, songs, and routine exposure. EYFS MFL provision emphasises:

- **Listening and responding**: Following simple instructions, joining in with songs and chants, responding to greetings
- **Oral rehearsal**: Repeating words and phrases, practising pronunciation through playful repetition
- **Routine language**: Embedding target language in daily routines—register, greetings, counting, weather
- **Games and movement**: Action songs, Simon Says, physical response activities that pair language with movement

### Key Stage 2

As pupils develop literacy skills and cognitive maturity, speaking activities increase in complexity:

- **Pattern and chunk acquisition**: Learning useful sentence stems and question frameworks that enable personalisation
- **Information gap activities**: Structured pair work requiring genuine information exchange
- **Simple presentations**: Describing family, hobbies, or local area using memorised and semi-scripted language
- **Role-play foundations**: Simple transactional scenarios—shop, restaurant, asking directions

### Key Stage 3

Secondary MFL builds primary foundations while introducing greater challenge:

- **Extended discourse**: Moving beyond single exchanges to sustained interaction
- **Opinion and justification**: Expressing and supporting viewpoints on familiar topics
- **Past and future narration**: Developing temporal competence in spoken production
- **Spontaneity development**: Activities bridging controlled practice towards genuine improvisation
- **Awareness of register**: Recognising and deploying formal and informal language appropriately

### Key Stage 4

GCSE preparation refines spoken competence for examination performance while maintaining communicative authenticity:

- **Examination skill development**: Photo card strategies, role-play conventions, conversation maintenance
- **Complex grammatical structures**: Incorporating subordinate clauses, modal verbs, and complex tenses into speech
- **Abstract topic discussion**: Engaging with social issues, global challenges, and cultural comparison
- **Independent communication**: Sustained spontaneous interaction with minimal scaffolding

## Effective Practice Recommendations

### Curriculum Design

1. **Prioritise speaking time**: Ensure every lesson includes substantial oral production opportunities, not merely teacher-led questioning
2. **Sequence carefully**: Progress from choral rehearsal through controlled pair work towards spontaneous interaction within each unit
3. **Recycle routinely**: Regular revisiting of previously learned language across new contexts builds automaticity
4. **Integrate skills**: Connect speaking activities with listening, reading, and writing to reinforce learning

### Classroom Culture

1. **Establish safety**: Create classrooms where error is expected, welcomed, and learned from
2. **Model enthusiasm**: Teacher target language use, pronunciation confidence, and communicative persistence inspire pupil participation
3. **Celebrate effort**: Acknowledge and praise communication attempts regardless of accuracy
4. **Build routines**: Consistent target language classroom management routines maximise exposure

### Individual Support

1. **Identify barriers**: Understand whether reluctance stems from pronunciation anxiety, grammatical insecurity, or social factors
2. **Provide scaffolds**: Sentence builders, word banks, planning time, and rehearsal opportunities enable participation
3. **Differentiate expectations**: Set appropriate challenge levels where all pupils experience success alongside stretch
4. **Monitor progress**: Track participation patterns and intervene promptly when pupils become persistently silent

## Conclusion

Speaking and communication represent the ultimate goal of MFL education—the ability to interact meaningfully with speakers of other languages. Achieving this goal requires understanding the theoretical foundations of communicative competence, recognising the pedagogical progression from controlled rehearsal to genuine spontaneity, and deploying evidence-based classroom strategies that build confidence alongside competence. Teachers who prioritise speaking, create safe rehearsal spaces, and gradually release responsibility to learners enable their pupils to move beyond scripted performance towards authentic communicative capability—the true measure of successful language learning.

## Appendix: Practical Activity Bank

### Quick Starter Activities (5-10 minutes)

**Speed Dating**
Pupils rotate partners every 60-90 seconds, exchanging brief conversations on a set topic. This builds fluency through repetition and exposes learners to multiple voices and speaking styles.

**Sentence Stealers**
Working in pairs, pupils construct sentences using word cards or dice. Partner B must "steal" the sentence by repeating it accurately and adding a detail, extending the original contribution.

**Hot Seat Questioning**
One pupil faces the class and responds to rapid-fire questions on a topic. The pace develops automaticity; the public nature builds performance confidence.

### Main Activities (15-25 minutes)

**Running Dictation with a Twist**
Rather than mere text reproduction, the "runner" must orally convey information to their scribe, who asks clarification questions. This embeds natural repair strategies and negotiation of meaning.

**The Market Place**
Pupils become "experts" on different aspects of a topic, memorising key information. They then circulate, explaining their topic to others and gathering information in return. This combines rehearsal with genuine information exchange.

**Mystery Guest**
One pupil assumes the identity of a famous person or character. The class asks yes/no questions to determine their identity. This develops question formation and strategic narrowing of possibilities.

**One-Pen-One-Paper**
Pairs share a single pen and paper to compose a written response to a prompt, but must discuss all content orally before writing. The constraint forces extensive spoken negotiation.

### Extended Activities (25-40 minutes)

**The Talk Show**
Groups prepare and perform a talk show segment: host, guest "expert," and audience questioners. This combines prepared speech with handling genuinely unpredictable audience contributions.

**The Trial**
Role-play a courtroom scenario with prosecution, defence, witnesses, and jury. The adversarial format demands persuasive speech, rapid response, and formal register.

**The Conference**
Pupils research and present on related topics, then participate in a Q&A panel. This rehearses both monologic presentation and interactive discussion skills.

**Radio Drama Production**
Groups write, rehearse, and record audio dramas. The recording requirement encourages attention to pronunciation and fluency; the dramatic context motivates extended production.

## Differentiation Strategies

### Supporting Less Confident Speakers

**Sentence Builders**
Provide visual scaffolds showing sentence stems with selectable elements:
- "I think that... because..."
- "In my opinion... however..."
- "One advantage is... but one disadvantage is..."

**Scripted Participation**
For whole-class activities, pre-teach and rehearse contributions with shy pupils. Knowing exactly what to say reduces anxiety and enables participation.

**Rehearsal Time**
Build in thinking and planning time before speaking. Written notes, mind maps, or recorded rehearsals enable preparation without undermining spontaneity.

**Safe Practice Spaces**
Use technology—voice recording apps, language learning platforms—to enable private practice before public performance.

### Extending Confident Speakers

**Complexity Challenges**
Require specific grammatical structures: "Include at least one subjunctive clause" or "Use three different past tenses."

**Extended Discourse**
Set minimum contribution lengths: "Speak for at least 30 seconds without pausing" or "Ask three follow-up questions before yielding the floor."

**Peer Teaching**
Confident speakers support less confident peers, modelling pronunciation and providing vocabulary. This consolidates their own learning while building classroom community.

---

## Technology Integration

### Voice Recording Tools

Recording enables self-assessment, teacher feedback without time pressure, and anxiety-reduced practice. Tools include:
- **MFL-specific apps** (Vocab Express, Memrise) with speaking components
- **Generic recording tools** (Voice Memos, Audacity) for free production
- **AI feedback tools** (emerging) that analyse pronunciation and fluency

### Video Conferencing

Connecting with native speakers or partner schools internationally provides authentic communicative necessity. Structured exchanges—with assigned topics, pre-teaching of vocabulary, and clear success criteria—maximise learning while managing anxiety.

### Interactive Whiteboards

Visual support enhances speaking activities: drag-and-drop sentence building, reveal games, timed challenges. The public display keeps all pupils engaged while the teacher works with individuals.

---

## Assessment for Learning in Speaking

### Self-Assessment

Pupils record themselves and evaluate against criteria:
- Did I use the target structures?
- Did I speak for the required duration?
- Did I respond to my partner's contributions?
- Where could I improve?

### Peer Assessment

Structured peer feedback—with sentence starters and specific foci—develops metalinguistic awareness:
- "I really liked how you..."
- "You could make your speaking even better by..."
- "One word I learned from you was..."

### Teacher Assessment

Live assessment during pair work enables immediate intervention. Focused marking of recordings provides detailed feedback. Both approaches should prioritise constructive, specific guidance over simple correction.

---

## Cross-Curricular Connections

### Literacy

Speaking activities reinforce literacy skills: prediction, summarisation, inference. Explicit connections—discussing how spoken and written language differ, how dialogue functions in narratives—deepen understanding in both domains.

### Drama

Drama strategies—hot-seating, conscience alley, thought tracking—provide structured speaking opportunities within motivating contexts. The emotional engagement of drama enhances memorability and willingness to participate.

### PSHE and Citizenship

MFL speaking activities on social issues—environment, diversity, community—connect language learning to personal development. Expressing opinions on meaningful topics increases motivation and provides culturally relevant content.

### Music

Songs and chants embed pronunciation patterns, build confidence through collective performance, and make repetition enjoyable. The rhythmic structure supports phonological awareness and memory.

## Conclusion: The Centrality of Speaking

Speaking and communication constitute the beating heart of language education. All other skills—listening, reading, writing—ultimately serve the goal of meaningful interaction. Teachers who prioritise speaking, who create classrooms where every pupil speaks extensively in every lesson, who scaffold progression from controlled rehearsal to genuine spontaneity, give their learners the greatest gift MFL education can offer: the confidence and capability to communicate across linguistic and cultural boundaries.

The journey from first hesitant utterances to fluent spontaneous communication is long and demanding. It requires patience, strategic scaffolding, and unwavering belief in every learner's capacity to succeed. But the destination—pupils who can confidently navigate foreign language interactions, who see themselves as capable communicators in multiple languages, who carry this confidence into an interconnected world—justifies every effort along the way.
