# Target Language Use in the MFL Classroom

## Introduction

Target language (TL) use lies at the heart of effective modern foreign language teaching. The principle is straightforward: the more time pupils spend hearing, processing, and producing the language they are learning, the more rapidly they develop proficiency. Yet the practical implementation of this principle raises complex pedagogical questions. How much target language should teachers use? What scaffolding is necessary to make TL input comprehensible? When, if ever, is it appropriate to use English in the classroom? These questions have been debated by language educators for decades and remain central to curriculum design and classroom practice today.

The rationale for maximising target language exposure is grounded in second language acquisition research. Stephen Krashen's Input Hypothesis (1985) posits that learners acquire language when they understand messages in the target language—what he terms "comprehensible input." Similarly, Swain's Output Hypothesis (1985) emphasises the importance of producing the language for developing fluency and accuracy. Both hypotheses suggest that time spent in the target language is time spent learning, whilst time spent in English represents a lost opportunity for language development.

The UK's Ofsted Curriculum Research Review: Languages (2021) identifies the use of the target language as a key component of high-quality language education. The review notes that "the target language should be used as much as possible" and emphasises the importance of creating an environment where pupils are encouraged to use the language spontaneously and authentically. This aligns with the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) recommendation that language educators and their students use the target language as exclusively as possible—90% or more—at all levels of instruction during instructional time.

## The Case for Maximum Target Language Use

### Research Foundations

The empirical case for maximising target language use is robust. Studies consistently demonstrate a correlation between time-on-task in the target language and language proficiency outcomes. ACTFL's position statement on target language use (2022) synthesises decades of research showing that immersion in the target language creates the conditions necessary for language acquisition to occur.

The theoretical foundation draws heavily on Krashen's distinction between learning and acquisition. Learning refers to the conscious study of language rules—what might happen when a teacher explains a grammar point in English. Acquisition, by contrast, refers to the unconscious development of language competence through meaningful interaction with comprehensible input. Whilst both processes have their place, acquisition is understood to be the primary driver of communicative competence. Maximum target language use creates the conditions for acquisition to occur.

Turnbull and Arnett (2002), in their comprehensive review of research on target language use, found that teachers who used the target language more extensively had students who demonstrated greater proficiency in listening comprehension, speaking, and overall language development. The relationship between teacher TL use and student outcomes is not merely correlational—when teachers increase their use of the target language, student TL production increases correspondingly.

### Benefits of Maximum TL Use

The benefits of maximising target language exposure extend across all domains of language proficiency:

**Listening Comprehension**: When teachers consistently use the target language, pupils develop the ability to understand authentic spoken language in real time. This is perhaps the most significant benefit, as listening comprehension underpins all other language skills. Pupils learn to infer meaning from context, recognise cognates, and tolerate ambiguity—essential skills for real-world communication.

**Speaking Fluency**: Maximum TL use creates an expectation and habit of speaking the language. When English is the default classroom language, pupils develop a mental model of the MFL classroom as a place where English is spoken about French/German/Spanish rather than a place where French/German/Spanish is spoken. Reversing this expectation requires consistent teacher modelling.

**Phonological Development**: Regular exposure to native or near-native pronunciation helps pupils develop accurate pronunciation and intonation. This is particularly important for phonemes that do not exist in English, such as the German /ch/ or the French nasal vowels.

**Vocabulary Acquisition**: Vocabulary encountered in context during teacher TL use is more likely to be retained than vocabulary presented as isolated items with English translations. Contextualised vocabulary is associated with richer mental representations and stronger retrieval cues.

**Grammatical Intuition**: Exposure to grammatical patterns in meaningful contexts helps pupils develop an intuitive sense of what "sounds right"—a form of implicit grammatical knowledge that complements explicit rule learning.

**Motivation and Engagement**: Many pupils find immersion in the target language motivating. It creates a sense of entering another linguistic world and validates the language as a genuine means of communication rather than merely a school subject.

## The 90% Target Language Goal

### Origins and Rationale

ACTFL's recommendation that 90% or more of classroom time should be spent in the target language has become an influential benchmark in language education. The figure emerged from research on immersion programmes, where higher levels of TL exposure consistently produced better outcomes. The 90% threshold represents a pragmatic balance between the ideal of 100% immersion and the reality that some use of English may be necessary for specific instructional purposes.

The recommendation is not arbitrary. Research by Fortune and Tedick (2008) on dual-language programmes found that learners needed significant exposure to the target language—typically 50% or more of instructional time—to develop high levels of proficiency. For foreign language programmes with limited contact hours (often just 2-3 hours per week in UK schools), the percentage of TL use during available time becomes even more critical.

### Practical Implications

Achieving 90% target language use requires intentionality and planning. Teachers must examine their classroom practices critically and identify opportunities to shift from English to the target language. Common areas where English creeps in include:

- Giving instructions for activities
- Managing behaviour and classroom routines
- Explaining grammar points
- Discussing cultural content
- Providing feedback on written work
- Handling administrative matters

Each of these functions can be conducted in the target language with appropriate scaffolding and routines.

The 90% figure refers to teacher talk as well as student talk. It encompasses all verbal communication in the classroom, including greetings, instructions, explanations, questions, feedback, and social conversation. Visual support—written text on the board, slides, handouts—should also prioritise the target language.

It is worth noting that 90% TL use is a goal to work towards rather than a standard all teachers must meet immediately. Teachers new to maximising TL use might aim for 50% initially, then gradually increase the percentage as they and their pupils become more comfortable with TL-only interaction.

## Scaffolding Strategies for Comprehensible Input

The challenge of maximising target language use is ensuring that the input remains comprehensible. If pupils cannot understand what is being said, the input is not processed for acquisition and may instead generate anxiety and disengagement. Scaffolding—temporary support structures that make input accessible—is therefore essential.

### Visual Support

Visual aids are perhaps the most powerful scaffolding tool for making target language input comprehensible. When teachers pair spoken language with visual representation, pupils can infer meaning from context even when they do not understand every word.

**Pictures and Images**: Photographs, illustrations, and diagrams can convey meaning directly without translation. A teacher describing a daily routine in French can display images representing each activity—waking up, eating breakfast, going to school—allowing pupils to map language onto meaning visually.

**Realia**: The use of real objects (realia) brings concrete reality into the abstract world of language. Food items, clothing, classroom objects, and personal possessions can all be used to make language tangible and comprehensible.

**Visual Timelines and Storyboards**: For sequencing activities or narrative content, visual timelines help pupils follow the temporal structure. Storyboards with key images support comprehension of extended spoken or written texts.

**Graphic Organisers**: Mind maps, Venn diagrams, flowcharts, and tables provide visual frameworks that help pupils process and organise information encountered in the target language.

### Gestures and Mime

Physical movement and gesture are universal supports for comprehension. Teachers can act out verbs, demonstrate prepositions through spatial relationships, and use facial expressions to convey emotion. This kinaesthetic scaffolding is particularly effective for younger learners but remains valuable across all key stages.

Total Physical Response (TPR), developed by James Asher, systematically incorporates physical movement into language instruction. Pupils respond to commands in the target language with actions—"Stand up," "Touch your nose," "Walk to the door"—demonstrating comprehension before they are asked to produce language themselves.

### Modified Speech

Teachers can adjust their spoken language to make it more accessible without switching to English:

**Slower Speech**: Speaking more slowly gives pupils processing time. Natural speech runs at approximately 150-180 words per minute; teacher speech might be reduced to 100-120 wpm for novice learners.

**Clearer Articulation**: Exaggerating articulation and pausing between phrases helps pupils identify word boundaries in the stream of speech.

**Simpler Syntax**: Using shorter sentences and avoiding embedded clauses reduces cognitive load. Subject-verb-object constructions are typically more accessible than complex sentences with multiple clauses.

**High-Frequency Vocabulary**: Drawing on the most common words in the language ensures that pupils are developing a usable core vocabulary.

**Repetition and Rephrasing**: Repeating key information and expressing the same idea in different ways provides multiple opportunities for comprehension.

### Cognates and Transfer

Teachers can explicitly highlight cognates—words that are similar in the target language and English—to help pupils leverage their existing linguistic knowledge. French "important," German "Information," and Spanish "interesante" are immediately comprehensible to English speakers. Drawing attention to these connections builds confidence and accelerates vocabulary development.

Similarly, teachers can help pupils identify patterns of transfer between languages. The Latin roots shared by English, French, and Spanish mean that many academic and abstract concepts have recognisable forms across languages.

### Contextual Redundancy

Effective TL use builds redundancy into communication. When a teacher introduces a new topic, they might pre-teach key vocabulary, provide visual support, use gestures, and rephrase key points. Multiple channels of information mean that if pupils miss something in one modality, they can pick it up from another.

### Comprehension Checks

Teachers must regularly check that pupils have understood. Asking "Do you understand?" rarely yields accurate information—pupils may claim understanding to save face or may not realise they have misunderstood. More effective strategies include:

- Asking pupils to demonstrate understanding through action (TPR)
- Using true/false or multiple-choice checks
- Having pupils summarise what was said
- Observing facial expressions and body language for signs of confusion

## The Code-Switching Debate

### Arguments Against L1 Use

The traditional case against using English in the MFL classroom rests on several arguments:

**Lost Learning Time**: Every minute spent speaking English is a minute not spent in the target language. Given the limited contact time available in most school timetables, this represents a significant opportunity cost.

**Linguistic Interference**: Translation between languages encourages a mental model of language learning as substitution—finding the English equivalent for every target language word. This inhibits the development of the ability to think directly in the target language.

**Habit Formation**: If English is established as the default classroom language early in a pupil's language learning career, it becomes increasingly difficult to shift expectations later. Patterns of classroom interaction become entrenched.

**Authenticity**: Real-world communication in the target language occurs without English support. The classroom should simulate authentic communication as far as possible.

### Arguments for Strategic L1 Use

More recent research has challenged the blanket prohibition on L1 use, arguing that strategic code-switching can support rather than hinder language learning:

**Cognitive Load Management**: When pupils are struggling to process complex information—such as a detailed grammar explanation or an abstract concept—the cognitive load of doing so in a new language may exceed their processing capacity. Strategic use of English allows pupils to focus on the concept rather than the language of instruction.

**Affective Factors**: Complete prohibition of English can generate anxiety, particularly for less confident learners. Knowing that support is available if needed can actually increase willingness to take risks in the target language.

**Metalinguistic Awareness**: Comparing the target language with English can develop explicit awareness of how languages work. This metalinguistic understanding supports both the target language and pupils' understanding of their first language.

**Efficiency**: Some explanations are genuinely more efficient in English. Spending ten minutes in the target language explaining a grammar point that could be clarified in two minutes in English represents lost time that could be spent on other TL activities.

**Individual Differences**: Learners vary in their preferred learning styles and strategies. Some benefit from translation and explicit comparison with English; others acquire more effectively through immersion alone.

### Evidence on Code-Switching

Research on code-switching in language classrooms has produced nuanced findings. Littlewood and Yu (2011), in a study of Hong Kong secondary students, found that pupils' use of their first language was influenced by the task, the context, and their proficiency level. Strategic L1 use was associated with deeper processing and collaborative learning.

Studies by Cook (2001) and others have shown that code-switching is a natural feature of bilingual and multilingual communication. When teachers and pupils share a common language, it is psychologically unnatural to prohibit its use entirely. The question is not whether code-switching will occur—it will—but how it is managed to support learning goals.

Research by Turnbull (2001) found a correlation between teacher target language use and student achievement, but this does not necessarily mean that zero English is optimal. The key factor appears to be the extent to which classroom interaction creates opportunities for meaningful communication in the target language, not the complete exclusion of English.

### A Principled Approach

The emerging consensus in the research literature favours a principled approach to code-switching rather than blanket prohibition or unrestricted use. Teachers might consider the following framework:

**Maximise TL as Default**: The default position should be target language use. Teachers should assume that activities, instructions, and interactions can be conducted in the TL unless there is a clear reason to use English.

**English for Metalinguistic Explanation**: Complex grammar explanations, discussions of language learning strategies, and metalinguistic commentary may be more effective in English, particularly for novice learners.

**English for Affect and Behaviour**: Managing serious behavioural issues or addressing sensitive emotional matters may require English to ensure clarity and appropriate tone.

**TL with Strategic Scaffolding**: Rather than defaulting to English when pupils do not understand, teachers should first attempt to scaffold comprehension through visual support, gesture, rephrasing, and other TL strategies.

**Pupil L1 for Peer Collaboration**: During pair and group work, pupils may use English to negotiate meaning and clarify understanding. This can be productive if it leads to TL output.

## Practical Classroom Strategies

### Establishing TL Routines

Consistent routines conducted in the target language create predictable contexts where pupils know what is expected. These might include:

- **Entry routines**: Greetings, taking the register, checking homework
- **Transition routines**: Moving between activities, distributing materials, changing seating
- **Closure routines**: Reviewing learning, setting homework, farewells

Once routines are established, they require minimal cognitive effort from pupils, allowing them to participate in TL interaction fluently.

### TL for Instructions

Giving instructions in the target language requires initial investment in teaching instructional language, but pays dividends in increased TL exposure. Teachers should:

- Teach key instructional phrases explicitly
- Pair verbal instructions with visual demonstrations
- Check comprehension before pupils begin the task
- Use consistent phrasing for common instructions

### TL for Behaviour Management

Classroom management can be conducted effectively in the target language. Many behaviour management phrases—"Sit down," "Be quiet," "Listen," "Look at me"—are high-frequency and easily taught. Using the TL for management avoids the jarring switch to English that often accompanies discipline.

### TL for Feedback

Oral feedback on pupil contributions should normally be in the target language. Teachers can develop a repertoire of feedback phrases:

- **Confirmation**: "Correct," "Yes," "Good"
- **Correction**: "Almost," "Listen again," "Try again"
- **Praise**: "Excellent," "Well done," "Perfect"
- **Elicitation**: "More?," "And?," "Tell me more"

Written feedback might include TL comments alongside English commentary, depending on pupil level and the nature of the feedback.

### TL for Cultural Content

Discussions of target language culture—the geography, history, customs, and daily life of target language communities—should be conducted in the target language where possible. This integrates cultural and linguistic learning and provides meaningful context for TL use.

### Visual Environment

The physical classroom environment should support TL use through:

- **Displays**: Posters, vocabulary walls, and student work in the target language
- **Signage**: Classroom labels and instructions in the target language
- **Technology**: Computer interfaces, if possible, set to the target language

### Managing the Transition to Higher TL Use

Teachers seeking to increase their TL use should plan the transition carefully:

- **Start gradually**: Increase TL use by 10-15% over a term rather than switching overnight
- **Explain the rationale**: Help pupils understand why TL use is important
- **Provide support**: Ensure scaffolding is in place before increasing TL demands
- **Be consistent**: Pupils need to trust that the teacher will persist with TL use
- **Review and adjust**: Monitor pupil response and adjust scaffolding as needed

## Progression Across Key Stages

### Key Stage 1 (Ages 5-7)

At this stage, target language exposure should be extensive but grounded in concrete, contextualised language. Young children have a natural capacity for language acquisition and are less self-conscious about making mistakes than older learners.

- Aim for 80-90% TL use from the teacher
- Focus on songs, rhymes, games, and routine language
- Use extensive gesture, visuals, and realia
- Accept and encourage spontaneous TL use from pupils
- Minimal explicit grammar; focus on chunks and patterns

### Key Stage 2 (Ages 7-11)

As pupils develop literacy in English, they can begin to engage with written TL and more explicit language study. TL use remains central, with increasing emphasis on pupil production.

- Maintain 70-80% TL use from the teacher
- Introduce simple reading and writing in the TL
- Begin teaching language learning strategies in English
- Develop pupil confidence in simple interactions
- Use TL for classroom routines consistently

### Key Stage 3 (Ages 11-14)

This is a critical period for establishing TL habits. Many pupils begin formal language study at this stage, and patterns established here persist through to GCSE.

- Target 70-80% TL use, with gradual increases as pupils progress through the key stage
- Develop pupil capacity for extended TL production
- Introduce metalinguistic terminology in English when necessary
- Use TL for most explanations, with strategic English for complex grammar
- Foster spontaneous TL use through structured activities

### Key Stage 4 (Ages 14-16)

At GCSE level, pupils should be capable of operating predominantly in the target language. The examination context requires development of specific skills, but TL use remains central to teaching.

- Aim for 80-90% TL use in lessons
- Conduct exam skill preparation in TL where possible
- Develop strategies for coping with unknown language (examination techniques)
- Use TL for feedback on written work and speaking practice
- Balance TL immersion with explicit exam preparation

### Post-16 (Ages 16-18)

At A-Level and equivalent qualifications, near-total immersion is achievable and desirable. Students are preparing for university study or professional use of the language.

- Target 90%+ TL use
- Conduct all discussion of literature, film, and culture in TL
- Develop sophisticated academic register in the target language
- Minimise English to complex metalinguistic analysis only

## Common Misconceptions and Challenges

### "Pupils Won't Understand"

A frequent concern among teachers is that using the target language will leave pupils confused and frustrated. Research suggests that appropriately scaffolded TL use is comprehensible to learners at all levels. The key is ensuring that the challenge is appropriate—not so easy that pupils are unengaged, not so difficult that they are overwhelmed.

### "It's Too Slow"

Some teachers worry that explaining in the target language takes longer than explaining in English. Whilst individual explanations may take longer initially, the cumulative effect of TL use is more efficient language development. Pupils who experience regular TL input develop comprehension skills that allow them to process increasingly complex language.

### "Lower Attainers Need English"

There is a persistent assumption that less able pupils benefit from more English. However, research suggests that lower attainers often benefit most from the additional input and support that carefully scaffolded TL use provides. English may be used for clarification, but should not be the default.

### "Grammar Needs English"

Explicit grammar instruction can be conducted in the target language through careful use of examples, colour-coding, and visual presentation. Many languages have grammatical terminology derived from Latin that is recognisable across languages, making metalinguistic discussion in the TL possible even for novice learners.

### Managing Pupil Resistance

Pupils may initially resist increased TL use, particularly if they have become accustomed to English-medium instruction. Strategies for managing this include:

- Explaining the rationale for TL use
- Acknowledging the difficulty whilst expressing confidence in pupils' ability
- Celebrating successes and progress
- Ensuring scaffolding is adequate so that pupils experience success
- Being consistent—mixed messages undermine the approach

## Assessment and Monitoring TL Use

### Self-Monitoring for Teachers

Teachers can audit their own TL use through:

- Audio or video recording lessons for review
- Colleague observation and feedback
- Pupil perception surveys
- Setting personal targets for TL percentage

### Assessing Pupil Progress

Progress in TL use can be assessed through:

- Listening comprehension tests
- Spontaneous speaking assessments
- Observations of pair and group work
- Pupil self-assessment of TL use in independent work

### Departmental Development

Whole-department approaches to increasing TL use are more effective than individual efforts:

- Shared schemes of work that specify TL opportunities
- Departmental CPD on scaffolding strategies
- Peer observation focused on TL use
- Collection and sharing of effective TL resources

## Technology and Target Language Use

Digital tools can support and extend TL use beyond the classroom:

**Language Learning Apps**: Duolingo, Memrise, and similar apps provide additional TL exposure and practice opportunities.

**Audio and Video Resources**: Authentic materials—films, songs, news broadcasts—expose pupils to native speaker TL use.

**Virtual Exchange**: Connections with partner schools in target language countries provide authentic communication opportunities.

**Recording Tools**: Pupils can record themselves speaking, allowing for self-assessment and reflection on TL production.

## Conclusion

Target language use is not merely a pedagogical preference but a fundamental principle of effective language teaching. The evidence is clear that pupils learn languages by using them, and that maximising exposure to and production of the target language accelerates proficiency development.

The 90% target provides a useful benchmark, but should not become a source of anxiety. Teachers should aim to increase their TL use progressively, ensuring that input is comprehensible through appropriate scaffolding. The goal is not to eliminate English entirely but to ensure that English is used strategically and that the default language of the MFL classroom is the language being learned.

The code-switching debate has moved beyond the question of whether to use English to the question of when and how English can support learning without undermining the immersive environment necessary for language acquisition. A principled approach that maximises TL use whilst recognising the legitimate role of English for specific purposes offers the best of both worlds.

Ultimately, the measure of success is not the percentage of TL use in isolation but the extent to which pupils develop the ability to understand and communicate in the target language. When pupils leave the classroom able to function in French, German, Spanish, or another language, the effectiveness of the approach is validated. Target language use is the path to that goal.
