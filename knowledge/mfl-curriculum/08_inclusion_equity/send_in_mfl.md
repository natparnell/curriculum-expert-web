# SEND in MFL: Supporting Learners with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities

## Introduction

Teaching Modern Foreign Languages (MFL) to learners with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) presents both unique challenges and profound opportunities for inclusive pedagogy. The SEND Code of Practice 2015 establishes a statutory framework requiring teachers to ensure that pupils with SEND can access the full curriculum, including languages. This knowledge file explores evidence-based approaches for supporting SEND learners in MFL classrooms, with particular attention to cognitive load management, dyslexia-friendly practices, scaffolding techniques, and statutory compliance.

The assumption that language learning is inappropriate for pupils with SEND has been thoroughly debunked by research demonstrating that with appropriate support, these learners can achieve meaningful progress in MFL. Indeed, the Communication and Language area of learning within the Early Years Foundation Stage and the National Curriculum entitlement to language learning apply to all pupils, regardless of additional needs.

## Statutory Framework and Legal Obligations

### The SEND Code of Practice 2015

The SEND Code of Practice provides the statutory guidance for organisations working with children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities. For MFL teachers, several provisions are particularly relevant:

**The Graduated Approach**

Schools must adopt a graduated approach to identifying and supporting pupils with SEND, comprising four stages:

1. **Assess**: Identifying pupils making less than expected progress given their age and individual circumstances
2. **Plan**: Developing outcomes and interventions collaboratively with parents and pupils
3. **Do**: Implementing the planned interventions and support
4. **Review**: Evaluating impact and adjusting provision accordingly

For MFL, this means language teachers must participate fully in the Assess-Plan-Do-Review cycle, not simply expect SEND support to be the sole responsibility of teaching assistants or SENCOs.

**Reasonable Adjustments**

Under the Equality Act 2010, schools must make reasonable adjustments to ensure disabled pupils are not placed at a substantial disadvantage. In MFL, reasonable adjustments might include:

- Providing vocabulary lists with visual support rather than requiring independent dictionary use
- Allowing additional time for written tasks
- Offering alternative formats for assessments
- Using assistive technology such as text-to-speech software
- Seating arrangements that optimise hearing and visual access

**Access Arrangements for Examinations**

The Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) regulations govern access arrangements for GCSE and A-level MFL examinations. Common arrangements for language learners include:

- Extra time (typically 25%)
- Supervised rest breaks
- A reader or reading pen
- A scribe
- Modified language papers (for specific disability categories)
- Separate accommodation

Teachers should work closely with SENCOs to ensure eligible pupils are assessed and applications made well in advance of examinations.

### The National Curriculum and Inclusion

The National Curriculum in England states that teachers should set high expectations for every pupil and plan stretching work for pupils whose attainment is significantly above the expected standard, while also planning lessons for pupils who require additional support.

For MFL specifically, the Programme of Study acknowledges that "pupils should be taught to" the specified objectives, with the understanding that appropriate differentiation enables access for all learners. The expectation is not that SEND learners should be excluded from language learning, but that teachers should adapt their approaches to facilitate participation.

## Cognitive Load Theory in MFL

### Understanding Cognitive Load

Cognitive Load Theory, developed by John Sweller, posits that working memory has limited capacity and that instructional design should account for these constraints. For SEND learners in MFL, cognitive load considerations are particularly crucial because language learning inherently demands simultaneous attention to multiple elements: phonology, vocabulary, grammar, pragmatics, and cultural knowledge.

**Types of Cognitive Load**

1. **Intrinsic load**: The inherent complexity of the material itself. In MFL, this includes the linguistic distance between English and the target language, irregular verb forms, and complex grammatical structures.

2. **Extraneous load**: Unnecessary demands created by instructional design. Examples include cluttered worksheets, unclear instructions, or requiring pupils to split attention between multiple sources of information.

3. **Germane load**: The productive cognitive effort devoted to learning and schema construction. The goal of instruction is to maximise germane load while managing intrinsic and minimising extraneous load.

### Managing Cognitive Load for SEND Learners

**Element Interactivity**

Sweller's concept of element interactivity is particularly relevant to MFL. When grammatical rules involve multiple interacting elements (e.g., subject-verb agreement across person and number), intrinsic cognitive load is high. For SEND learners, reducing element interactivity through careful sequencing is essential:

- Teach grammatical concepts in isolation before requiring integration
- Use worked examples demonstrating step-by-step processing
- Provide partially completed examples to reduce the number of elements requiring simultaneous attention
- Employ the "isolated-interactive elements" approach, presenting elements separately before combining them

**The Modality Effect**

Cognitive Load Theory suggests that working memory comprises partially independent processors for visual and auditory information. The modality effect indicates that presenting information across both channels can increase working memory capacity. In MFL:

- Pair written text with clear audio delivery
- Use visual organisers alongside verbal explanations
- Avoid presenting identical information simultaneously through both channels (redundancy effect)
- Leverage dual coding through imagery and linguistic content

**The Split-Attention Effect**

When learners must mentally integrate information from multiple spatially separated sources, extraneous cognitive load increases. MFL teachers should:

- Integrate labels directly into diagrams rather than using keys
- Present vocabulary with images adjacent to text, not on separate pages
- Ensure grammatical explanations appear alongside examples, not in separate reference sections
- Use embedded glossaries rather than separate vocabulary lists during reading activities

### Working Memory Considerations

Many learners with SEND, particularly those with specific learning difficulties such as dyslexia, have working memory profiles that differ from neurotypical peers. Research by Gathercole and Alloway demonstrates that working memory constraints significantly impact language learning.

**Implications for MFL Instruction**

- **Reduce simultaneous processing demands**: Avoid requiring pupils to listen, write, and process new grammatical structures concurrently
- **Provide external memory supports**: Word mats, substitution tables, and writing frames reduce working memory burden
- **Use consistent routines**: Familiar structures reduce extraneous cognitive load, freeing capacity for language processing
- **Chunk information**: Present vocabulary and structures in meaningful groups rather than isolated items
- **Allow processing time**: Build in think-time before requiring responses

## Dyslexia-Friendly Approaches in MFL

### Understanding Dyslexia and Language Learning

Dyslexia is a specific learning difficulty primarily affecting the skills involved in accurate and fluent word reading and spelling. Characteristic features include difficulties with phonological awareness, verbal memory, and verbal processing speed. The British Dyslexia Association estimates that approximately 10% of the population has dyslexia, with 4% severely affected.

Research by Helland and Kaasa, among others, has demonstrated that dyslexia affects second language acquisition, particularly in areas involving phonological processing and orthographic mapping. However, this does not mean learners with dyslexia cannot succeed in MFL; rather, they benefit from specific pedagogical approaches that accommodate their cognitive profiles.

### Phonological Awareness and Pronunciation

**The Challenge**

Phonological processing difficulties characteristic of dyslexia create particular challenges for MFL pronunciation and listening comprehension. Learners may struggle to:

- Discriminate between similar sounds in the target language
- Retain phonological information in working memory
- Map sounds to orthographic representations
- Produce accurate pronunciation of unfamiliar phonemes

**Evidence-Based Strategies**

- **Multisensory phonics approaches**: Integrate visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic elements when teaching pronunciation. The Anita Archer approach, adapted for MFL, emphasises seeing the letter, saying the sound, and writing the grapheme simultaneously.

- **Explicit phonological awareness training**: Before introducing new vocabulary, teach the component sounds systematically. The Sparks, Ganschow, and Patton research on the Linguistic Coding Differences Hypothesis supports explicit multisensory structured language teaching.

- **Overlearning and repetition**: Provide multiple opportunities to encounter and practise sounds in varied contexts. Distributed practice is more effective than massed practice for phonological learning.

- **Visual sound mapping**: Use colour-coding, hand signals, or visual representations to support phonological memory. The visual dimension can provide an alternative retrieval route when phonological routes are less efficient.

### Orthographic Processing and Spelling

**The Challenge**

English-speaking learners with dyslexia often struggle with the opaque orthography of English. Depending on the target language, they may encounter:

- More transparent orthographies (Spanish, Italian, German) that can actually facilitate reading
- Complex orthographic conventions (French silent letters, accents)
- Different scripts (Russian Cyrillic, Mandarin characters)
- Orthographic depth affecting reading development

**Evidence-Based Strategies**

- **Transparent language advantage**: Research by Landerl suggests that learners with dyslexia may actually perform relatively better in languages with transparent orthographies compared to opaque English. MFL teachers should highlight regular sound-spelling correspondences explicitly.

- **Structured word inquiry**: Adapt approaches from English literacy teaching to MFL, examining word structures, prefixes, suffixes, and root forms systematically.

- **Dyslexia-friendly fonts and formatting**: Use sans-serif fonts (Arial, Verdana, Comic Sans), minimum 12pt size, 1.5 line spacing, and adequate margins. Avoid justified text and dense blocks of print.

- **Colour and contrast**: Ensure high contrast between text and background. Some learners benefit from coloured overlays or tinted paper, though this should be determined on an individual basis.

### Reading Comprehension

**The Challenge**

Decoding difficulties in MFL texts can consume working memory resources, leaving insufficient capacity for comprehension. Learners with dyslexia may demonstrate:

- Slow, effortful reading that impedes comprehension
- Difficulty retaining text meaning while decoding individual words
- Anxiety around reading aloud that affects classroom participation
- Reluctance to engage with extended texts

**Evidence-Based Strategies**

- **Pre-teaching vocabulary**: Ensure learners recognise key vocabulary before encountering it in connected text. This reduces decoding demands during reading.

- **Text-to-speech support**: Technology tools that read text aloud while highlighting words can support comprehension while developing decoding skills.

- **Reading strategies instruction**: Teach specific strategies such as skimming for gist, scanning for specific information, and using context clues systematically.

- **Differentiated texts**: Provide texts at varied complexity levels on the same topic, ensuring all learners can access meaningful content.

- **Graphic organisers**: Provide frameworks for organising information from texts, reducing the working memory demands of comprehension.

## Scaffolding Strategies for SEND in MFL

### Theoretical Foundations

Scaffolding, derived from Vygotsky's concept of the Zone of Proximal Development, involves providing temporary support that enables learners to accomplish tasks they cannot yet complete independently. For SEND learners in MFL, scaffolding is not remedial but rather a pedagogical essential that enables access to challenging content.

The Gradual Release of Responsibility model (Pearson and Gallagher) provides a useful framework: teacher modelling → guided practice → collaborative practice → independent application. SEND learners may require extended time at each stage and the possibility of returning to earlier stages when encountering new challenge levels.

### Vocabulary Scaffolding

**Visual Scaffolds**

- **Word mats**: Topic-specific vocabulary organised with images, displayed on desks or walls
- **Vocabulary notebooks**: Personal reference books with learner-generated definitions and drawings
- **Picture dictionaries**: Visual supports that reduce reliance on abstract text-based dictionaries
- **Icon symbols**: Consistent visual symbols for grammatical categories (colours for gender, symbols for verb types)

**Linguistic Scaffolds**

- **Cognates and near-cognates**: Explicitly highlight connections between English and the target language
- **Word families**: Teach morphological patterns that enable inference of related words
- **High-frequency vocabulary prioritisation**: Focus on the most useful words first (the Pareto principle: 20% of vocabulary enables 80% of communication)
- **Spaced retrieval practice**: Structure vocabulary review using research-informed intervals (Carpenter et al.)

### Grammar Scaffolding

**Substitution Tables**

Substitution tables provide a powerful scaffold for sentence construction, enabling learners to create grammatically accurate sentences by selecting from columns:

```
Je        | mange   | une pomme
Tu        | bois    | du pain
Il/Elle   | prends  | de l'eau
Nous      | voulons | des fruits
```

This structure reduces cognitive load while enabling meaningful communication and implicit grammar acquisition.

**Writing Frames**

Provide sentence starters and paragraph structures that allow learners to focus on content while grammatical form is partially provided:

- "Yesterday I went to..."
- "First I... Then I... Finally I..."
- "In my opinion... because..."

**Colour Coding**

Consistent colour coding for grammatical categories provides visual support for sentence construction:

- Subject pronouns in one colour
- Verbs in another
- Objects in a third
- Connectives in a fourth

### Speaking Scaffolds

**Planned Speech Opportunities**

- Provide thinking time before oral responses
- Allow rehearsal with partners before whole-class contribution
- Share question stems in advance
- Offer choice in response complexity

**Communication Strategies**

Teach explicit strategies for when learners encounter gaps in their linguistic knowledge:

- Circumlocution (talking around unknown vocabulary)
- Use of hesitation devices ("Let me think...")
- Requesting clarification
- Using first language strategically

**Peer Support Structures**

- **Talking partners**: Consistent pairings that build trust and familiarity
- **Role allocation**: Structured roles ensuring all contribute (e.g., questioner, responder, reporter)
- **Scripted dialogues**: Provide written support for oral interaction

### Listening Scaffolds

**Pre-Listening**

- Activate prior knowledge through discussion or visual stimuli
- Pre-teach key vocabulary
- Establish purpose for listening
- Preview question types

**During Listening**

- Allow multiple listenings without stigma
- Provide graphic organisers for note-taking
- Break longer texts into manageable chunks
- Use visual supports alongside audio

**Post-Listening**

- Confirm comprehension through low-stakes activities
- Address any vocabulary or structures that caused difficulty
- Connect to personal experience or prior learning

## Supporting Specific Categories of Need

### Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC)

Learners with autism spectrum conditions may demonstrate:

- Strengths in explicit grammar learning and pattern recognition
- Challenges with pragmatic language use (register, tone, social conventions)
- Preference for predictable routines and clear expectations
- Sensory sensitivities affecting classroom participation

**Support Strategies**

- Provide advance notice of activities and transitions
- Use visual timetables and clear structures
- Teach socio-pragmatic aspects explicitly (when to use tu vs. vous, formal vs. informal register)
- Establish calm, low-sensory spaces for learning
- Leverage interests and special interests in language contexts

### Speech, Language and Communication Needs (SLCN)

Learners with SLCN may struggle with:

- Phonological processing and discrimination
- Syntax and sentence construction
- Vocabulary acquisition and retrieval
- Pragmatic language use

**Support Strategies**

- Integrate MFL with speech and language therapy targets where appropriate
- Focus on receptive language before demanding expressive production
- Use total physical response (TPR) approaches that reduce verbal demands
- Provide augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) supports as needed

### Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)

**Support Strategies**

- Structure lessons with varied activities and movement opportunities
- Use multi-sensory approaches that engage attention
- Provide fidget tools and movement breaks
- Give immediate, specific feedback
- Break tasks into clearly defined, short segments

### Social, Emotional and Mental Health (SEMH)

Language learning can be particularly challenging for learners with SEMH needs due to:

- Fear of making mistakes or appearing foolish
- Difficulty with peer interaction and group work
- Potential for past negative experiences with education

**Support Strategies**

- Create low-anxiety learning environments
- Celebrate effort and progress, not just accuracy
- Provide choices to increase sense of control
- Build positive relationships and trust
- Use language learning as a vehicle for success and confidence-building

## Assessment and Feedback

### Formative Assessment Approaches

Effective formative assessment for SEND learners in MFL focuses on:

- **Retrieval practice**: Low-stakes quizzing that strengthens memory without inducing anxiety
- **Diagnostic questioning**: Targeted questions that reveal specific misconceptions
- **Peer assessment**: Structured opportunities for learners to support each other's learning
- **Self-assessment**: Metacognitive development through reflection on learning

### Adaptive Assessment

When standard assessment approaches may not capture SEND learners' capabilities:

- Allow oral responses where written would impede demonstration of knowledge
- Accept scaffolded performances as evidence of learning
- Provide alternative formats (presentations, recordings, visual representations)
- Focus on communicative effectiveness rather than grammatical accuracy alone

### Feedback Principles

- **Specific and actionable**: Identify exactly what was successful and what needs development
- **Timely**: Provide feedback while learning is still fresh
- **Focused**: Prioritise key areas for improvement rather than marking every error
- **Forward-looking**: Frame feedback in terms of next steps and future application

## Assistive Technology and Resources

### Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text

Modern technology offers powerful supports for SEND learners in MFL:

- **Reading pens**: Portable devices that scan and read text aloud
- **Text-to-speech software**: Applications that read digital text with natural voices
- **Speech-to-text**: Tools that enable learners to produce written work through dictation
- **Translation tools**: Used judiciously, these can support comprehension (while recognising limitations)

### Vocabulary Learning Applications

Spaced repetition systems such as Memrise, Quizlet, and Anki offer adaptive vocabulary practice that can be particularly beneficial for learners who require additional repetition and varied encounters with new words.
