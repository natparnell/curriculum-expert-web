# Adaptive Teaching in Modern Foreign Languages

Adaptive teaching in MFL represents a fundamental shift from traditional differentiation models toward responsive, inclusive pedagogical approaches that meet the diverse needs of all learners. This approach recognises that every MFL classroom contains pupils with varying linguistic backgrounds, cognitive profiles, prior knowledge, and learning needs—requiring teachers to adapt their practice dynamically rather than relying on static, predetermined strategies.

## Understanding Adaptive Teaching vs Differentiation

### The Limitations of Traditional Differentiation

Traditional differentiation in MFL classrooms often involved three-tiered worksheets, leveled vocabulary lists, or ability-based groupings that effectively created ceiling effects for less confident learners whilst limiting challenge for the most able. The DfE's *Teachers' Standards* (2011, updated 2021) and subsequent Ofsted inspections have increasingly challenged this approach, highlighting how rigid differentiation can embed low expectations and restrict progress.

Key criticisms of traditional differentiation in MFL include:

- **Resource intensity**: Creating three versions of every activity places unsustainable demands on teacher workload
- **Ceiling effects**: Pupils assigned to 'lower' tiers internalise fixed mindsets about their linguistic capabilities
- **Mobility barriers**: Once placed in a tier, pupils rarely move between groups regardless of progress or emerging understanding
- **Social stigma**: Visible differentiation signals to pupils (and parents) that they are 'less able' language learners
- **Pedagogical incoherence**: Tasks may differ so substantially that pupils experience different curricula rather than adapted versions of the same learning

The British Council's *Inclusion in Modern Foreign Languages* guidance (2019) notes that differentiation strategies such as 'giving easier work to less able pupils' often result in pupils being denied access to core curriculum content, particularly the rich cultural and communicative dimensions that make language learning meaningful.

### Defining Adaptive Teaching in the MFL Context

Adaptive teaching, by contrast, involves **responsive adjustments to the teaching of the same ambitious content**, ensuring all pupils access cognitively demanding material whilst receiving targeted support and scaffolding as needed. The Department for Education's *Early Career Framework* (2019) and *Core Content Framework* explicitly advocate for adaptive teaching, defining it as:

> "Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, whilst also maintaining high expectations for all."

In MFL specifically, adaptive teaching means:

- **Same ambitious goals**: All pupils work toward the same learning objectives and communicative outcomes
- **Flexible scaffolding**: Support structures (sentence builders, word banks, listening transcripts) are available to all and removed as pupils gain confidence
- **Responsive intervention**: Teachers identify misconceptions and gaps in real-time and adjust instruction accordingly
- **Universal Design for Learning (UDL)**: Tasks are designed from the outset to accommodate diverse learners through multiple means of representation, engagement, and expression

The transition from differentiation to adaptive teaching is not merely semantic; it represents a fundamental reconceptualisation of how MFL teachers conceptualise ability, design learning sequences, and respond to pupil needs.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Growth Mindset and Linguistic Capability

Carol Dweck's research on growth mindset (2006) provides essential psychological grounding for adaptive teaching in MFL. Traditional differentiation often inadvertently promoted fixed mindset beliefs by implying that linguistic 'ability' is stable and predetermined. Adaptive teaching, conversely, communicates that language proficiency is developed through effort, strategy, and quality instruction.

In practice, this translates to MFL classrooms where:
- All pupils attempt authentic communicative tasks regardless of prior attainment
- Struggle is framed as productive and necessary for language acquisition
- Teacher feedback focuses on process and strategy rather than innate capability
- Pupils understand that making errors is an integral part of interlanguage development

### Cognitive Load Theory and Adaptive Scaffolding

Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory (1988) and subsequent refinements (Sweller, van Merriënboer & Paas, 1998) inform how adaptive teachers manage the inherent complexity of language learning. MFL learning simultaneously imposes:

- **Intrinsic cognitive load**: The complexity of the language system itself (grammar, vocabulary, phonology)
- **Extraneous cognitive load**: Unnecessary barriers such as unclear instructions, unfamiliar contexts, or overly complex task formats
- **Germane cognitive load**: The productive effort dedicated to schema construction and automatisation

Adaptive teaching in MFL involves reducing extraneous load whilst maintaining appropriate challenge. For example:
- Providing glossaries or sentence builders reduces working memory demands, allowing focus on target language production
- Pre-teaching vocabulary removes barriers to comprehension tasks
- Breaking complex grammar explanations into manageable chunks supports working memory

Critically, adaptive teachers understand that scaffolding should be **temporary and removable**—the goal is always to reduce support as pupils develop expertise, following Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) principles.

### Universal Design for Learning (UDL)

The CAST organisation's Universal Design for Learning framework (2018) offers a systematic approach to designing inclusive MFL curricula from the outset rather than retrofitting accommodations. UDL's three principles align directly with MFL pedagogy:

**Multiple Means of Representation**: Presenting language and culture through varied modalities
- Visual supports (images, colour-coding, graphic organisers) accompany oral input
- Bilingual glossaries and etymological explanations support comprehension
- Subtitled video and transcripts make authentic materials accessible

**Multiple Means of Engagement**: Creating purposeful contexts for language use
- Authentic communication scenarios with genuine communicative purpose
- Pupil choice in topic, mode of response, or collaborative arrangements
- Varied cultural contexts that reflect pupils' interests and backgrounds

**Multiple Means of Action and Expression**: Allowing varied demonstration of learning
- Oral, written, and digital modes for presenting understanding
- Collaborative and individual task options
- Scaffolds (sentence builders, speaking frames) available to all

UDL shifts the locus of adaptation from reactive teacher adjustments to proactive curriculum design—creating flexible learning environments that anticipate and accommodate diversity.

## Responsive Teaching: The Adaptive Cycle

Responsive teaching represents the dynamic core of adaptive practice, involving continuous assessment-informed adjustments to instruction. In MFL, this cycle operates at multiple timescales:

### Moment-to-Moment Responsiveness

Skilled MFL teachers continuously monitor pupil responses during lessons, using this real-time data to adjust their teaching:

**Checking for understanding**: Rather than assuming comprehension based on confident nods, adaptive teachers use techniques such as:
- Cold calling to sample understanding across the class
- Mini-whiteboards for immediate visual assessment of written responses
- Translation or transformation tasks that reveal comprehension gaps
- Pupil-to-pupil explanation that surfaces partial understanding

**Responsive explanation**: When formative assessment reveals misconceptions, teachers immediately adjust their explanations—perhaps rephrasing, using a different example, or drawing on pupils' prior knowledge.

**Adaptive questioning**: Teachers vary question difficulty and support based on emerging pupil responses, providing hints or breaking questions down for struggling learners whilst extending thinking for those demonstrating mastery.

### Lesson-Level Adaptations

Across the arc of a lesson, adaptive teachers make strategic decisions based on accumulated formative evidence:

**Pacing adjustments**: If whole-class checking reveals widespread confusion, the teacher may revisit key concepts rather than proceeding to planned activities. Conversely, if pupils demonstrate early mastery, challenge tasks can be introduced.

**Grouping decisions**: Rather than fixed ability groups, adaptive teachers use fluid, purposeful groupings that may pair pupils with different strengths (e.g., a pupil strong in spoken fluency with one secure in written accuracy) or provide targeted teacher support to specific pupils during independent practice.

**Resource deployment**: Additional adults (teaching assistants, student teachers) are deployed responsively based on identified needs rather than permanently attached to particular pupils.

### Long-Term Planning Adaptations

Over sequences of lessons, responsive teaching involves:

**Retrieval-informed sequencing**: Regular low-stakes quizzing reveals which vocabulary and structures have been retained, informing decisions about what to reteach or consolidate before introducing new content.

**Error pattern analysis**: Systematic review of pupil work samples identifies common misconceptions that may require whole-class reteaching (e.g., persistent errors with verb conjugations, confusion between similar phonemes).

**Individual adaptations**: For pupils with identified needs, responsive teaching involves collaborative planning with SENCOs, EAL specialists, or external agencies to ensure appropriate support and challenge.

## Meeting Diverse Needs in MFL

### Supporting Pupils with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND)

The DfE's *SEND Code of Practice* (2015) places a statutory obligation on schools to ensure pupils with SEND access the full curriculum. In MFL, this presents particular challenges and opportunities.

**Cognition and Learning Needs**:

Pupils with specific learning difficulties (dyslexia, dyspraxia, working memory difficulties) often face barriers in MFL related to:
- Phonological processing: Distinguishing and reproducing unfamiliar sounds
- Orthographic mapping: Connecting sounds to unfamiliar spelling systems
- Working memory: Holding vocabulary and grammar in mind whilst constructing utterances
- Processing speed: Managing the rapid pace of conversational exchanges

Adaptive strategies include:
- Multisensory approaches: Combining visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic elements (e.g., Total Physical Response for vocabulary, colour-coding for grammar patterns)
- Overlearning and distributed practice: Regular retrieval practice to support automatisation
- Graphic organisers: Visual supports for organising ideas before speaking or writing
- Technology: Text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and translation tools that remove transcription barriers
- Extra time and reduced output: Allowing quality over quantity in assessments

The British Dyslexia Association's *Modern Foreign Languages and Dyslexia* guidance (2017) emphasises that pupils with dyslexia can succeed in MFL when provided with explicit phonics instruction, consistent routines, and opportunities to overlearn through varied activities.

**Communication and Interaction Needs**:

Pupils with speech, language, and communication needs (SLCN) or autism spectrum conditions may find the unpredictable, social nature of MFL challenging. Adaptive approaches include:

- Visual timetables and clear routines that reduce anxiety about transitions
- Pre-teaching of vocabulary and scripts that provide security for spoken activities
- Structured paired and group work with assigned roles and clear expectations
- Alternative modes of participation (written responses, digital tools) when oral contributions are challenging
- Explicit teaching of pragmatics and cultural conventions that neurotypical pupils may infer intuitively

**Sensory and Physical Needs**:

For pupils with hearing impairments, visual impairments, or physical disabilities, adaptive teaching involves:
- Positioning and acoustic modifications for hearing-impaired pupils
- Enlarged or adapted materials for visually impaired pupils
- Modified writing implements or scribing support for pupils with fine motor difficulties
- Alternative response modes that allow demonstration of linguistic knowledge without physical barriers

### Supporting English as an Additional Language (EAL) Pupils

EAL pupils bring unique strengths to MFL classrooms, including metalinguistic awareness, code-switching experience, and cultural knowledge. However, they may also face specific challenges when the language of instruction (English) is still being acquired alongside the target language.

**Strengths to leverage**:
- Bilingual pupils often demonstrate superior phonological awareness and understanding of language as a system
- Experience navigating multiple cultural contexts supports intercultural understanding
- Strategies developed for learning English can transfer to additional language learning

**Adaptive approaches for EAL pupils**:
- Bilingual glossaries and dictionaries that allow pupils to connect new vocabulary to their home language
- Cognate awareness: Explicit teaching of cognates between English, the home language, and the target language
- Visual and contextual support that reduces reliance on English comprehension for task understanding
- Opportunities to share cultural knowledge and make cross-linguistic connections
- Flexible grouping that pairs pupils with shared home languages for peer support

The Bell Foundation's *EAL and MFL* guidance (2020) notes that EAL pupils should not be withdrawn from MFL on the assumption they are 'already bilingual'—the specific challenges of the target language (particularly if it differs typologically from their home language) require full curricular access and appropriate support.

### Supporting Disadvantaged Pupils and Closing the Vocabulary Gap

Pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds often enter MFL classrooms with reduced exposure to the cultural capital that supports language learning—fewer opportunities for international travel, limited access to enrichment activities, and smaller academic vocabularies in English that affect comprehension of target language explanations.

The Education Endowment Foundation's (EEF) *Improving Literacy in Secondary Schools* (2019) and *Metacognition and Self-Regulated Learning* (2018) guidance reports inform adaptive approaches:

**Vocabulary development**: Explicit teaching of tier 2 and tier 3 vocabulary in English supports comprehension of MFL instruction and materials.

**Oracy development**: Structured talk activities in English before target language activities build the discourse skills needed for pair and group work.

**Cultural capital**: Careful selection of contexts and resources that build cultural knowledge without assuming prior experience.

**Metacognitive strategy instruction**: Teaching pupils explicit strategies for vocabulary memorisation, comprehension monitoring, and error correction supports independent learning.

**High expectations**: Maintaining ambitious goals whilst providing necessary scaffolding communicates belief in all pupils' capacity for linguistic success.

## Practical Adaptive Strategies for the MFL Classroom

### Pre-Teaching and Frontloading

Proactive identification of potential barriers allows teachers to provide support before pupils encounter difficulties:

- **Vocabulary pre-teaching**: Key vocabulary for an upcoming topic is taught explicitly using multimodal approaches (visuals, actions, etymology) before it appears in texts or communicative tasks
- **Grammar preparation**: Foundational concepts (e.g., gender agreement, verb conjugation patterns) are reviewed before introducing new contexts
- **Context building**: Cultural or topical background knowledge is developed through English-medium discussion before target language materials are introduced
- **Task rehearsal**: Complex task formats (e.g., role-plays, presentations) are modelled and rehearsed before independent production

### Scaffolds and Supports

Adaptive teaching involves designing support structures that are available to all pupils and gradually removed as competence develops:

**Temporary scaffolds**:
- Sentence builders: Grids showing word order and grammatical choices that support sentence construction
- Speaking frames: Scripted openings and connectives that support extended speech
- Word mats: Topic vocabulary organised thematically with visual support
- Writing scaffolds: Paragraph structures, success criteria, and checklist supports

**Permanent supports**:
- Classroom displays: Key vocabulary, grammar rules, and pronunciation guides visible for reference
- Bilingual dictionaries: Available for independent vocabulary look-up
- Phonics resources: Sound-spelling correspondences displayed and taught systematically

The key principle is that **permanent supports are available to all; temporary scaffolds are faded** as pupils gain confidence and competence.

### Flexible Grouping Strategies

Rather than fixed 'ability' groups, adaptive teachers use varied grouping arrangements based on learning purposes:

**Collaborative learning**: Mixed-attainment pairs or groups allow peer modelling and explanation. Pupils who have partially mastered a concept often explain it effectively to peers, consolidating their own understanding.

**Targeted support**: During independent practice, teachers work intensively with specific pupils identified through formative assessment as needing additional support or challenge.

**Interest grouping**: Grouping by topic preference or learning approach preference increases engagement and allows pupils to work with different peers.

**Linguistic grouping**: Pairing pupils who share home languages can support EAL pupils; pairing pupils with different strengths (e.g., speaking fluency vs. grammatical accuracy) creates mutually beneficial learning partnerships.

### Assessment for Learning in Adaptive Practice

Responsive teaching depends on high-quality formative assessment. In MFL, effective approaches include:

**Low-stakes retrieval practice**: Regular quizzing of vocabulary and grammar supports learning and provides teachers with data about what has been retained.

**Diagnostic questioning**: Carefully designed questions that reveal specific misconceptions (e.g., diagnostic activities that expose confusion between perfect and imperfect tenses in French).

**Pupil self-assessment**: Checklists and success criteria that allow pupils to monitor their own progress and identify areas for improvement.

**Peer assessment**: Structured peer feedback using clear criteria supports metacognitive development whilst providing additional assessment data.

**Assessment of spoken language**: Techniques such as cold calling, randomised sampling, and digital recording provide evidence of speaking competence beyond confident volunteers.

## Progression and Assessment

### Adaptive Assessment Practices

Assessment in adaptive MFL classrooms maintains high expectations for all whilst recognising that pupils may demonstrate learning in varied ways:

**Universal assessment**: All pupils attempt the same assessment tasks, but appropriate access arrangements (extra time, scribes, modified formats) ensure SEND pupils can demonstrate their knowledge.

**Varied response modes**: Where possible, pupils may choose how to demonstrate learning—through speaking, writing, or digital creation—provided all modes address the same learning objectives.

**Formative use of summative data**: Results from assessments are analysed to identify patterns that inform future teaching, not merely to assign grades or levels.

### Tracking Progress

Adaptive teaching requires sophisticated tracking that goes beyond simple attainment measures:

- **Starting points**: Recognition that pupils enter MFL with vastly different prior experiences and that progress should be measured from these individual starting points
- **Effort and engagement**: Tracking indicators of motivation and participation alongside linguistic outcomes
- **Longitudinal patterns**: Monitoring progress across key stages to identify pupils who are falling behind or requiring additional challenge
- **Cross-referencing**: Comparing MFL progress with performance in other subjects to identify subject-specific barriers or strengths

## Professional Development for Adaptive Teaching

Developing adaptive teaching expertise requires ongoing professional learning:

### Subject Knowledge Development

Teachers need deep understanding of:
- The linguistic systems they teach (phonology, morphology, syntax, pragmatics)
- Common learner errors and misconceptions in MFL
- Second language acquisition research and its implications for pedagogy
- The specific challenges faced by SEND and EAL learners in language learning

### Pedagogical Skill Development

Adaptive teaching requires sophisticated skills in:
- Real-time formative assessment and responsive adjustment
- Designing inclusive tasks using UDL principles
- Managing flexible groupings and individual support within whole-class contexts
- Fading scaffolding appropriately to promote independence

### Collaborative Practice

Adaptive teaching is enhanced through:
- Joint planning with SENCOs and EAL specialists
- Observation and coaching focused on responsive teaching practices
- Peer collaboration to develop shared resources and strategies
- Engagement with professional subject associations (ALL, TES, university research centres)

## Conclusion

Adaptive teaching in MFL represents a mature, evidence-informed approach to meeting diverse
