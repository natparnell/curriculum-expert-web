# Digital Tools and Technology in MFL Teaching

## Overview

The integration of digital tools and technology in Modern Foreign Language (MFL) teaching has transformed pedagogical practice across UK schools, offering unprecedented opportunities for authentic communication, personalised learning, and cross-cultural exchange. The Department for Education's Technology in Schools Survey 2024-2025 reveals widespread adoption of digital tools across teaching contexts, with significant implications for language education specifically. This knowledge file examines the major categories of digital technology employed in MFL classrooms, their pedagogical applications, research evidence regarding effectiveness, and practical guidance for implementation across key stages.

Digital technology in MFL serves multiple complementary purposes: providing exposure to authentic target-language materials, facilitating repetitive practice through adaptive learning platforms, enabling communication with native speakers through virtual exchanges, and supporting assessment through sophisticated tracking and analytics. The British Council's Language Trends England 2025 report indicates that 82 per cent of schools use commercially produced digital resources, while 41 per cent supplement these with resources produced within their own institutions.

## Language Learning Applications

### Commercial Language Apps and Their Classroom Applications

Language learning applications have become ubiquitous in MFL education, with platforms such as Duolingo, Babbel, Memrise, and Busuu now commonplace in both primary and secondary contexts. These applications employ gamification techniques—points, streaks, leaderboards, and rewards—to motivate learners and encourage regular practice. The pedagogical design of these platforms typically emphasises vocabulary acquisition, grammatical pattern recognition, and receptive skills through spaced repetition algorithms that optimise memory retention.

Research into the effectiveness of language learning apps presents a nuanced picture. Jiang's 2021 study, published in *Foreign Language Annals*, found that Duolingo can be an effective tool for foreign language learning, particularly for developing reading and listening outcomes at beginning levels. The Duolingo Research Report DRR-24-07 surveyed educators and found that the majority agree that "language learning apps and digital tools are an effective way to help my students improve their language skills" and that "classroom instruction along with language learning apps can help students learn a language better than classroom instruction alone."

However, significant pedagogical limitations must be acknowledged. Language apps typically struggle to develop productive skills (speaking and writing) to the same extent as receptive skills. The interaction they offer is fundamentally non-reciprocal: the app cannot truly respond to a learner's communicative intentions in the way a human interlocutor can. As Handley (2024) notes in *The Modern Language Journal*, there is a risk that the public may come to believe AI-powered apps can replace language instruction entirely.

### Pedagogical Integration Strategies

Effective integration of language apps requires thoughtful pedagogical framing. The most successful implementations position apps as complementary tools rather than replacements for classroom instruction. Teachers can leverage apps for:

**Homework and independent practice:** Assigning specific modules for vocabulary consolidation or grammar reinforcement, with classroom time reserved for communicative activities that require productive use of the language.

**Differentiation:** Using apps to provide personalised practice paths for learners at different proficiency levels, allowing advanced learners to progress while supporting those who need additional consolidation.

**Formative assessment:** Many apps provide detailed analytics on learner performance, which teachers can use to identify areas of difficulty and adjust their teaching accordingly.

**Motivation and engagement:** The gamification elements can be particularly motivating for reluctant learners, helping to establish regular practice habits that support long-term language development.

### Duolingo for Schools

Duolingo for Schools represents a specific adaptation of commercial language apps for educational contexts. This platform allows teachers to create classroom groups, assign specific skills or units, and monitor learner progress through a teacher dashboard. The interface enables differentiation by allowing teachers to assign different content to different learners based on their needs. While the underlying content remains the same as the consumer version of Duolingo, the classroom management features provide teachers with greater oversight and control over learner activity.

The pedagogical value of Duolingo for Schools lies primarily in its ability to support vocabulary acquisition and basic grammatical structures through spaced repetition. Teachers should be clear with learners about the limitations of the platform—it cannot develop conversational fluency, cultural understanding, or the ability to negotiate meaning in unpredictable communicative situations. Best practice involves using Duolingo for Schools as a supplement to, rather than replacement for, communicative classroom activities.

## Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs)

### Definition and Core Functions

A Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), also referred to as a learning platform, is an online system that enables teachers to share educational materials and communicate with learners via the web. VLEs serve as digital hubs for course organisation, resource distribution, and learner-teacher interaction. In the context of MFL teaching, VLEs typically host multimedia resources including audio and video materials, interactive exercises, assessment tools, and collaborative spaces for learner interaction.

The DfE Digital and Technology Standards, updated in January 2024, specify minimum requirements for schools' digital infrastructure, including guidance on VLE implementation and accessibility. These standards emphasise the importance of ensuring that digital tools are usable by all learners, including those with special educational needs and disabilities. For MFL specifically, this includes considerations around audio content (transcripts, adjustable playback speeds) and visual materials (subtitles, appropriate contrast ratios).

### VLE Platforms in UK Schools

Common VLE platforms in UK educational contexts include:

**Google Classroom:** Widely adopted due to its integration with other Google Workspace for Education tools, Classroom provides a streamlined interface for assignment distribution, collection, and feedback. For MFL, it supports multimedia submissions including audio and video recordings, enabling speaking practice and assessment.

**Microsoft Teams for Education:** Integrated with the Office 365 ecosystem, Teams offers comprehensive collaboration features including video conferencing, document co-authoring, and assignment management. The Immersive Reader feature provides particular benefits for MFL learners, offering text-to-speech functionality that can support pronunciation development and reading comprehension.

**Showbie:** Popular in primary contexts, Showbie offers a simple interface for sharing resources and collecting learner work. Its audio recording features make it particularly suited to MFL contexts where speaking practice is essential.

**Firefly, Frog, and RM Unify:** These UK-specific platforms are designed with the English education system in mind and offer extensive customisation options for schools. They typically include features for tracking learner progress against curriculum objectives, which supports assessment in MFL.

### MFL-Specific VLE Applications

Beyond general functionality, VLEs support MFL-specific pedagogical activities:

**Resource libraries:** Teachers can curate collections of authentic materials—news articles, videos, podcasts, songs—organised by theme, difficulty level, or curriculum objective. This supports independent listening and reading practice.

**Assessment portfolios:** Learners can build portfolios of spoken and written work over time, demonstrating progression and supporting teacher assessment. Audio and video submissions enable assessment of speaking skills that would be difficult to capture through traditional means.

**Collaborative projects:** VLE discussion forums and collaborative document spaces enable peer interaction in the target language. Learners can engage in asynchronous discussions, co-create presentations, or conduct peer review of written work.

**Flipped learning:** Teachers can upload instructional content for learners to access before class, maximising classroom time for interactive practice and application.

## Artificial Intelligence in MFL Teaching

### Current Applications of AI in Language Education

Artificial intelligence is increasingly present in MFL classrooms, appearing in three main forms: as the underlying technology in adaptive learning platforms, as generative AI tools for content creation and feedback, and as conversational agents for language practice.

**Adaptive learning platforms:** AI algorithms power the personalised learning paths in platforms like Duolingo, Memrise, and commercial MFL schemes such as Language Angels and Primary Languages Network. These systems analyse learner responses to identify knowledge gaps and adjust the difficulty and sequencing of content accordingly.

**Generative AI tools:** Tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini offer opportunities for content creation, feedback generation, and authentic communication practice. Teachers can use these tools to generate differentiated reading texts, create example responses at different proficiency levels, or produce culturally relevant materials.

**Conversational AI:** Voice-based AI assistants and chatbots provide opportunities for spoken interaction practice. These tools have advanced significantly, with contemporary systems capable of understanding context, managing turn-taking, and providing relevant responses to learner utterances.

### Pedagogical Opportunities and Risks

The British Council's 2024 report, *Artificial Intelligence and English Language Teaching*, examines the implications of AI for language education globally. The report identifies significant opportunities including personalisation at scale, immediate feedback, and access to authentic interaction opportunities. However, it also highlights risks that MFL teachers must navigate:

**Over-reliance on AI:** There is a danger that learners may become dependent on AI tools for translation and correction, undermining the development of independent language proficiency. Teachers must establish clear boundaries regarding when AI assistance is appropriate and when learners should work independently.

**Accuracy concerns:** AI language models, while impressive, are not infallible. They may produce grammatically incorrect or culturally inappropriate output, particularly for less commonly taught languages. Teachers must develop the digital literacy to evaluate AI-generated content critically.

**Data privacy:** The use of AI tools involves sharing learner data with third-party providers. Schools must ensure compliance with GDPR and their own data protection policies when implementing AI tools.

**Equity of access:** Not all learners have equal access to devices and internet connectivity outside school. Over-reliance on AI-powered homework may disadvantage learners from less affluent backgrounds.

### AI and Teacher Professional Development

The integration of AI in MFL teaching has implications for teacher professional development. The 2025 study by Babanoğlu et al. in *SAGE Open* emphasises the need for teachers to develop "knowledge about the nature of AI, how to benefit from AI tools, and what associated problems to evade." Professional development should address:

- Understanding the capabilities and limitations of current AI tools
- Ethical considerations in AI use, including academic integrity and data privacy
- Pedagogical strategies for integrating AI tools without undermining learning objectives
- Critical evaluation of AI-generated content for accuracy and appropriateness

The DfE Technology in Schools Survey 2024-2025 found that AI adoption is accelerating across schools, with many institutions developing policies and guidance for responsible use. MFL departments should be proactive in establishing departmental protocols for AI use that align with whole-school policies while addressing subject-specific considerations.

## Video Exchange and Telecollaboration

### Synchronous Video Exchange

Video exchange and telecollaboration involve real-time or asynchronous communication between learners in different locations, often across national borders. Synchronous video exchange—live video conferencing between classrooms—provides opportunities for authentic communication with peer learners who speak the target language as their first language.

The pedagogical benefits of synchronous video exchange include:

**Authentic communication:** Learners engage in genuine communicative situations where they must negotiate meaning, clarify understanding, and respond to unpredictable input. This contrasts sharply with the scripted interactions typical of language learning apps.

**Cultural learning:** Direct interaction with peers from the target culture provides insights into daily life, cultural practices, and contemporary issues that would be difficult to access through textbooks or traditional media.

**Motivation:** The opportunity to communicate with real peers in other countries can be highly motivating, providing a clear purpose for language learning and a tangible audience for learner output.

**Development of speaking skills:** Synchronous video exchange requires spontaneous production of spoken language, developing fluency and confidence in ways that asynchronous or individual practice cannot replicate.

### Asynchronous Video Exchange

Asynchronous video exchange involves recording and sharing video messages rather than interacting in real-time. Platforms such as Flipgrid (now Flip), Padlet, and dedicated exchange platforms like ePals support this form of communication. Asynchronous exchange offers advantages including:

**Flexibility:** Messages can be recorded and viewed at convenient times, overcoming scheduling constraints and time zone differences.

**Preparation time:** Learners can plan their contributions, check pronunciation, and rehearse before recording, potentially producing more accurate and complex language than in spontaneous synchronous interaction.

**Documentation:** Video exchanges create a record of learner progress over time, supporting assessment and portfolio development.

**Reduced anxiety:** Some learners find asynchronous recording less anxiety-inducing than live video interaction, potentially supporting participation from learners who might be silent in synchronous contexts.

### Pedagogical Design for Video Exchange

Effective video exchange requires thoughtful pedagogical design. Simply connecting classrooms is insufficient; teachers must structure activities that support meaningful communication and language development:

**Structured tasks:** Exchange activities should have clear objectives and formats—interviews, presentations, collaborative projects, cultural comparisons—that provide scaffolding for learner communication.

**Preparation and follow-up:** Learners need preparation time to acquire relevant vocabulary and cultural knowledge before exchanges, and follow-up activities that consolidate learning and address difficulties encountered during exchange.

**Reciprocity:** Effective exchanges involve balanced participation, with learners both producing and receiving content in the target language. This may require careful partnership matching and ongoing monitoring.

**Reflection:** Post-exchange reflection activities help learners consolidate learning, identify new vocabulary and structures encountered, and reflect on cultural insights gained.

## Virtual Exchanges and eTwinning

### The eTwinning Programme

eTwinning, managed by the British Council in the UK, is a European Commission initiative that enables schools across Europe to collaborate on joint projects through secure digital technology. Co-funded by the Erasmus+ programme, eTwinning provides a free platform for European teachers to communicate, collaborate, and create projects. Since its launch in 2005, eTwinning has grown to become one of the world's largest networks of teachers, with over 800,000 registered educators.

The eTwinning platform provides:

**Partner finding tools:** Teachers can search for potential partner schools based on location, language, subject area, and project interests.

**TwinSpace:** A secure, GDPR-compliant virtual classroom space where partnered schools can share resources, communicate, and collaborate on projects.

**Project Diary:** A structured documentation tool that supports project planning, implementation, and evaluation.

**Professional development:** eTwinning offers training, resources, and recognition (through Quality Labels and the annual eTwinning Awards) for participating teachers.

**National Support Organisations:** In each participating country, NSOs provide local language support, validation of teacher registrations, and pedagogical guidance.

### Pedagogical Framework for eTwinning Projects

Effective eTwinning projects in MFL typically follow a structured pedagogical framework:

**Project-based learning:** eTwinning projects are inherently project-based, with learners working collaboratively across borders to produce a shared outcome—whether a digital story, a cultural comparison, a joint magazine, or a research project. This approach integrates language learning with content learning and 21st-century skills development.

**Task-based language teaching:** Project activities are structured as communicative tasks that require learners to use the target language for genuine purposes. Tasks are sequenced from simpler information exchange to more complex collaborative production.

**Intercultural learning:** eTwinning explicitly supports intercultural learning through structured comparison of cultural practices, values, and perspectives. The Council of Europe's *Autobiography of Intercultural Encounters* provides a framework for supporting reflection on intercultural experiences.

**Digital literacy development:** Participation in eTwinning develops learners' digital literacy as they learn to use collaborative tools, create digital content, and communicate appropriately in online environments.

### Implementing eTwinning in UK Schools

For UK MFL teachers, eTwinning offers particular value in the post-Brexit context. Despite the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, British schools remain eligible to participate in eTwinning, maintaining valuable connections with European partner schools. Implementation involves:

**Registration:** Teachers register on the eTwinning portal and complete validation through the British Council (the UK National Support Organisation).

**Partner finding:** Teachers search for partners using the eTwinning partner finding tools, or respond to partner requests from other schools.

**Project planning:** Partners collaborate to plan project objectives, activities, timelines, and assessment approaches.

**Implementation:** Learners engage in collaborative activities through TwinSpace, supported by their teachers.

**Documentation and recognition:** Teachers document projects through the Project Diary and can apply for Quality Labels or enter the eTwinning Awards.

### Research Evidence for Virtual Exchange

Research into virtual exchange and telecollaboration consistently demonstrates positive outcomes for language learning and intercultural development. O'Dowd's extensive research in this field has identified key factors for successful virtual exchange including careful task design, adequate preparation, and ongoing teacher facilitation. Studies consistently show that virtual exchange can:

- Develop linguistic competence, particularly in informal registers and interactive skills
- Increase intercultural awareness and sensitivity
- Enhance motivation and engagement with language learning
- Develop digital literacy and online communication skills
- Support the development of learner autonomy

However, research also highlights challenges including technical difficulties, scheduling constraints, varying levels of teacher commitment, and the need for careful pedagogical design to ensure language learning outcomes are achieved.

## Assessment and Digital Tools

### Digital Assessment in MFL

Digital technology transforms assessment possibilities in MFL, enabling more frequent, varied, and detailed assessment of learner progress:

**Speaking assessment:** Audio and video recording tools enable assessment of speaking skills without the logistical constraints of face-to-face examination. Learners can record responses to prompts, and teachers can assess these at convenient times, with the ability to replay and review.

**Portfolio assessment:** Digital portfolios enable collection of learner work over time, demonstrating progression and supporting holistic assessment of language development. VLEs and dedicated portfolio tools support organisation and presentation of portfolio evidence.

**Automated feedback:** Some digital platforms provide automated feedback on selected-response items and, increasingly, on productive skills through speech recognition and natural language processing. While automated feedback cannot replace teacher judgment, it can provide immediate response that supports learner self-correction and reduces teacher workload for routine practice activities.

**Learning analytics:** Digital platforms generate data on learner engagement, performance patterns, and progress over time. Teachers can use this data to identify learners who may be struggling, adjust teaching approaches, and provide targeted support.

### Formative Assessment through Digital Tools

Digital tools particularly support formative assessment—the ongoing monitoring of learner understanding that informs teaching decisions:

**Diagnostic tools:** Online quizzes and adaptive tests can identify learners' prior knowledge and areas of difficulty at the beginning of a topic.

**Real-time response systems:** Tools such as Mentimeter, Kahoot, and Socrative enable teachers to gather immediate feedback on learner understanding during lessons, allowing for responsive teaching adjustments.

**Progress tracking:** Many digital platforms track learner progress through curriculum content, providing visualisations of achievement that support both teacher monitoring and learner self-assessment.

**Self-assessment tools:** Digital rubrics and checklists support learner self-assessment, developing metacognitive awareness and learner autonomy.

## Implementation Considerations and Digital Equity

###Ensuring Equitable Access

A critical consideration in implementing digital tools in MFL is ensuring equitable access for all learners. The DfE Technology in Schools Survey 2024-2025 highlights ongoing disparities in device availability and internet connectivity, particularly affecting learners from disadvantaged backgrounds. Schools must consider:

**Device provision:** Ensuring that all learners have access to appropriate devices for completing digital homework and accessing online resources. The DfE Digital and Technology Standards recommend minimum device-to-learner ratios that schools should meet.

**Internet connectivity:** Recognising that not all learners have reliable internet access at home. Schools should provide alternatives for learners who cannot access online resources outside school hours, such as downloadable content that can be used offline or extended access to school computer facilities.

**Digital literacy support:** Some learners may lack the digital skills to navigate complex platforms effectively. Teachers should provide explicit instruction in using digital tools, not assuming prior knowledge or competence.

**Accessibility considerations:** Ensuring that digital tools are accessible to learners with special educational needs and disabilities. This includes compatibility with screen readers, adjustable text sizes, captions for video content, and alternative formats for materials.

### Safeguarding and Digital Citizenship

The use of digital tools in MFL, particularly those involving communication with external partners, raises important safeguarding considerations:

**GDPR compliance:** Schools must ensure that any digital tools used comply with data protection regulations. This includes reviewing terms of service, ensuring appropriate consent has been obtained, and understanding how learner data will be stored and processed.

**Online safety:** When engaging in video exchanges or virtual collaborations, teachers must establish clear protocols for appropriate online behaviour and have mechanisms in place to address any concerns that arise.

**Digital citizenship:** MFL teachers have an opportunity to develop learners' digital citizenship skills, including appropriate online communication, critical evaluation of digital content, and understanding of digital footprints.

### Managing Cognitive Load

While digital tools offer significant benefits, they can also introduce cognitive load that may impede language learning. Teachers should be mindful of:

**Tool complexity:** Platforms that require extensive navigation or have cluttered interfaces may divert cognitive resources away from language processing. Teachers should select tools with intuitive interfaces and provide clear guidance on their use.

**Multimodal overwhelm:** Digital resources often combine text, audio, video, and interactive elements. While this can be engaging, it may also overwhelm learners, particularly those with attention difficulties or limited prior knowledge. Teachers should scaffold learners' engagement with complex multimodal resources.

**Technical troubleshooting:** When technology fails, lesson time can be lost to technical problem-solving. Teachers should have contingency plans for technology failures and minimise reliance on complex technical setups during observed lessons or assessments.

## Progression in Digital Competence Across Key Stages

### Early Years and Key Stage 1

In the early stages of language learning, digital tools should be used sparingly and primarily for exposure to authentic target language input:

**Appropriate tools:** Simple audio and video resources, interactive whiteboard activities, and age-appropriate apps that focus on vocabulary acquisition through play.

**Pedagogical focus:** Developing enjoyment of language learning, building basic vocabulary, and establishing positive associations with the target language culture through engaging multimedia content.

**Teacher role:** Heavy teacher mediation required, with digital tools used as part of structured whole-class or small-group activities rather than independent work.

### Key Stage 2

As learners progress through primary school, they can engage more independently with digital tools:

**Appropriate tools:** Language learning apps for homework, simple VLE activities, audio recording tools for practising pronunciation, and introductory video exchanges with partner schools.

**Pedagogical focus:** Developing independent learning habits, building confidence in producing spoken language, and beginning to use digital tools for communication with target language speakers.

**Teacher role:** Supporting the development of independent learning skills, monitoring engagement with digital homework, and facilitating structured collaborative activities.

### Key Stage 3

Secondary MFL programmes can incorporate a wider range of digital tools and more complex activities:

**Appropriate tools:** Full VLE integration, participation in eTwinning projects, use of AI tools for feedback and practice, and engagement with authentic digital content from target language communities.

**Pedagogical focus:** Developing learner autonomy, engaging with authentic materials, and using digital tools to support extended production in speaking and writing.

**Teacher role:** Facilitating learner choice in tool selection, supporting critical evaluation of digital content, and managing more complex collaborative projects.

### Key Stage 4 and Beyond

At GCSE level and beyond, learners should be competent independent users of digital tools for language learning:

**Appropriate tools:** Comprehensive use of all categories of digital tool for independent study, participation in extended virtual exchanges, use of professional-grade tools for portfolio development and presentation.

**Pedagogical focus:** Preparing learners for independent language use beyond formal education, developing advanced digital literacy skills, and using digital tools to support sophisticated language production and intercultural engagement.

**Teacher role:** Coaching learners in effective independent study strategies, providing guidance on tool selection for specific learning objectives, and facilitating authentic communication opportunities.

## Professional Development for MFL Teachers

Effective integration of digital tools requires ongoing professional development that addresses both technical skills and pedagogical knowledge:

### Technical Competence

Teachers need confidence in using the specific tools available in their context. This includes:

- Navigating VLE platforms and troubleshooting common issues
- Using audio and video recording tools effectively
- Managing collaborative platforms and online communication tools
- Understanding the functionality of AI-powered tools and their limitations

### Pedagogical Knowledge

Beyond technical skills, teachers need pedagogical knowledge to use digital tools effectively:

- Understanding when digital tools enhance learning and when they may be counterproductive
- Designing activities that leverage the affordances of specific digital tools
- Managing mixed-ability classes where learners may have varying levels of digital competence
- Assessing learning that takes place through digital interactions and activities

### Keeping Current

The landscape of educational technology changes rapidly. MFL teachers should:

- Engage with professional communities (such as ALL, the Association for Language Learning) to share practice and learn about new tools
- Participate in training opportunities offered by tool providers (many offer free webinars and certification programmes)
- Evaluate new tools critically, considering their pedagogical value rather than being swayed by novelty
- Contribute to whole-school digital strategy, ensuring that MFL-specific needs are represented

## Conclusion

Digital tools and technology offer powerful opportunities to enhance MFL teaching and learning, but their effective integration requires thoughtful pedagogical planning. Language learning apps can support vocabulary acquisition and basic skill development, but cannot replace the authentic communication that lies at the heart of language learning. VLEs provide infrastructure for resource sharing and assessment, but require careful design to ensure accessibility and engagement. AI offers possibilities for personalisation and feedback, but raises important questions about accuracy, privacy, and the development of learner independence. Video exchanges and virtual collaborations connect learners with authentic target language contexts, but demand significant planning and facilitation to realise their potential.

The research evidence consistently points to a key principle: digital tools are most effective when they support, rather than replace, high-quality teaching. The teacher remains central to designing meaningful learning experiences, selecting appropriate tools for specific learning objectives, and facilitating the interactions that develop both linguistic competence and intercultural understanding. As the DfE Technology in Schools Survey 2024-2025 demonstrates, digital technology is now ubiquitous in UK schools; the challenge for MFL teachers is to harness its potential while maintaining focus on the communicative, cultural, and cognitive dimensions of language learning that define our discipline.
