# Second Language Acquisition Theory: From Krashen to the Interaction Hypothesis

## Overview

Second Language Acquisition (SLA) theory provides the scientific foundation for how learners acquire additional languages beyond their first. Understanding these theories is essential for Modern Foreign Languages (MFL) teachers, as they inform pedagogical decisions, classroom activities, and the overall design of language programmes. This knowledge base entry examines the major theoretical frameworks that have shaped language teaching, from Stephen Krashen's influential Monitor Model through to Michael Long's Interaction Hypothesis and Merrill Swain's Comprehensible Output Hypothesis.

The development of SLA theory over the past five decades represents a shift from viewing language learning as primarily a cognitive process of rule memorisation to understanding it as a complex interaction between input, output, cognitive processing, and social negotiation. For teachers in UK schools, these theories provide evidence-based principles for designing lessons that maximise language acquisition across Key Stages 2, 3, and 4.

## Krashen's Monitor Model: The Foundation of Modern SLA Theory

### Historical Context and Development

Stephen Krashen, an American linguist and educational researcher, developed his theory of second language acquisition during the 1970s and 1980s. His work emerged in response to the dominant audio-lingual method of language teaching, which emphasised repetition, drill, and the formation of habits through conditioning. Krashen's insights drew upon observations of how children acquire their first language naturally, without formal instruction, and he sought to apply these principles to second language learning.

Krashen's theory, often called the Monitor Model or the Input Hypothesis, consists of five interconnected hypotheses that together provide a comprehensive framework for understanding how languages are acquired. While some aspects of Krashen's theory have been critiqued and refined by subsequent research, his work remains foundational to the field and continues to influence language teaching practice worldwide.

### The Acquisition-Learning Hypothesis

The cornerstone of Krashen's theory is the distinction between acquisition and learning, two fundamentally different processes that operate in distinct ways within the language learner's mind.

#### Language Acquisition

Acquisition is the subconscious process by which learners internalise language through exposure to meaningful communication. It parallels how children acquire their first language: through understanding messages, focusing on meaning rather than form, and gradually developing an intuitive feel for the language's structure. Acquisition occurs naturally when learners are focused on communicating rather than on the language itself.

In the MFL classroom, acquisition happens when learners are engaged in authentic communicative tasks—role-playing a restaurant scene, discussing their interests with a partner, or responding to comprehensible stories in the target language. The learner's attention is on the message, not on grammatical rules or vocabulary lists. Over time, through repeated exposure to comprehensible input, learners develop a natural, intuitive sense of what sounds right in the language.

#### Language Learning

Learning, by contrast, is the conscious process of knowing about language. It involves explicit instruction in grammar rules, vocabulary memorisation, and the deliberate study of language forms. Learning produces what Krashen calls "knowing about" the language rather than the ability to use it spontaneously.

While learning has its place—particularly for older learners who can benefit from metalinguistic understanding—it cannot, according to Krashen, directly result in acquisition. A learner might be able to explain the rule for the subjunctive in French without being able to use it naturally in conversation. This distinction has profound implications for classroom practice, suggesting that grammar instruction alone is insufficient for developing communicative competence.

### The Monitor Hypothesis

The Monitor Hypothesis explains the relationship between acquisition and learning. Krashen proposes that the acquired system is responsible for spontaneous, fluent speech—the language we produce when communicating naturally. The learned system, however, can function as a "monitor" or editor that checks and adjusts output before or after it is produced.

#### Conditions for Monitor Use

For the monitor to operate, three conditions must be met:

**Time**: The speaker must have sufficient time to access learned knowledge and apply it. In rapid conversation, there is rarely time to consult conscious rules.

**Focus on Form**: The speaker must be focused on correctness rather than simply on communicating meaning. When the priority is getting a message across, the monitor has little opportunity to intervene.

**Knowledge of Rules**: The speaker must know the relevant grammatical rule. Many rules are complex and may not have been learned, or may have been learned incompletely.

#### Monitor Over-Users and Under-Users

Krashen identifies different types of language users based on their relationship to the monitor. Some learners are "monitor over-users"—perfectionists who are so concerned with correctness that their speech becomes hesitant and unnatural. They pause frequently to check their output against learned rules, disrupting the flow of communication. This is often associated with high anxiety and a lack of self-confidence.

Other learners are "monitor under-users"—those who rely almost entirely on their acquired system and show little concern for grammatical accuracy. Extroverts often fall into this category, communicating freely but with variable accuracy. The ideal is the "optimal monitor user" who can draw on learned knowledge when appropriate—during writing tasks or prepared presentations—while allowing acquired knowledge to drive spontaneous communication.

### The Natural Order Hypothesis

Krashen proposes that learners acquire grammatical structures in a predictable, natural order that is largely independent of the order in which these structures are taught. This natural order appears to be consistent across learners with different first languages and different learning environments, suggesting that it reflects universal cognitive processes rather than characteristics of the target language or the instructional approach.

#### Implications for Teaching

The Natural Order Hypothesis suggests that explicit instruction in grammatical structures will not change the order in which learners naturally acquire them. A teacher might intensively teach the perfect tense, but learners will only truly acquire it when they are developmentally ready. This does not mean that grammar teaching is pointless, but it suggests that such teaching should be seen as providing comprehensible input and raising awareness rather than directly causing acquisition.

In practice, this means that MFL teachers should not be discouraged when learners continue to make errors with structures that have been explicitly taught. Errors may indicate that learners are not yet developmentally ready to acquire those structures. The teacher's role is to continue providing rich, comprehensible input that allows learners to progress naturally through the acquisition sequence.

### The Input Hypothesis

Perhaps the most influential of Krashen's hypotheses, the Input Hypothesis addresses the question of how acquisition occurs. Krashen argues that acquisition happens when learners are exposed to comprehensible input—language that is slightly beyond their current level of competence.

#### i + 1: The Formula for Acquisition

Krashen expresses this as the formula "i + 1", where "i" represents the learner's current interlanguage (their present level of competence) and "+ 1" represents language that is one step beyond. If input is at the learner's current level (i), there is nothing new to acquire. If it is too far beyond (i + 2 or i + 3), it becomes incomprehensible and cannot contribute to acquisition.

The key is that the input must be both comprehensible and slightly advanced. This is achieved not through simplified language alone, but through context, visual support, prior knowledge, and the learner's own active processing of meaning. A learner might understand a text containing new grammatical structures because of pictures, cognates, context clues, and their general understanding of the topic.

#### Sources of Comprehensible Input

Comprehensible input can come from various sources: teacher talk, reading materials, listening activities, and interaction with more proficient speakers. In the MFL classroom, teachers provide comprehensible input through careful modification of their speech—using visuals, gestures, slower pace, and clear context—while ensuring that the language they use is nevertheless authentic and rich.

Extensive reading and listening are particularly powerful sources of comprehensible input. When learners read or listen to materials that are slightly above their level but made comprehensible through context, they absorb new vocabulary and structures naturally, without conscious effort.

### The Affective Filter Hypothesis

Krashen recognises that cognitive factors alone do not determine acquisition. The Affective Filter Hypothesis proposes that emotional factors can either facilitate or block the processing of comprehensible input. When the affective filter is high, input cannot reach the language acquisition device; when it is low, acquisition proceeds efficiently.

#### Key Affective Variables

Three variables are particularly important in determining the level of the affective filter:

**Motivation**: Learners who are highly motivated to acquire the language—whether for integrative reasons (wanting to connect with the target language community) or instrumental reasons (wanting to achieve a practical goal)—tend to have lower affective filters. They are more willing to take risks, make mistakes, and persist in the face of difficulty.

**Self-Confidence**: Learners with a positive self-image and confidence in their ability to succeed are more likely to acquire language. Those who doubt themselves, who fear failure, or who have internalised negative messages about their language learning capabilities will have higher affective filters that impede acquisition.

**Anxiety**: Language anxiety—fear of negative evaluation, fear of making mistakes, or general anxiety about language learning—raises the affective filter significantly. Anxious learners may avoid participation, disengage from communicative activities, and fail to process input that they would otherwise understand.

#### Classroom Implications

The Affective Filter Hypothesis has profound implications for classroom atmosphere and practice. Teachers must create a low-anxiety environment where learners feel safe to take risks and make mistakes. This involves:

- Establishing a supportive, non-judgmental classroom culture
- Avoiding excessive correction that might increase anxiety
- Celebrating effort and progress, not just accuracy
- Designing tasks that are achievable yet challenging
- Building learners' self-confidence through success experiences
- Addressing the specific anxieties that individual learners may bring to the language classroom

## Beyond Krashen: The Output and Interaction Hypotheses

While Krashen's model remains influential, subsequent researchers have identified limitations and proposed complementary or alternative hypotheses. Two of the most significant developments are Merrill Swain's Output Hypothesis and Michael Long's Interaction Hypothesis.

### Merrill Swain and the Comprehensible Output Hypothesis

Merrill Swain, a Canadian researcher, proposed the Output Hypothesis in response to what she saw as an overemphasis on input in Krashen's model. Based on her research with French immersion students in Canada—who received extensive comprehensible input but often failed to achieve native-like grammatical competence—Swain argued that production (output) plays a crucial role in language acquisition that cannot be fulfilled by input alone.

#### The Three Functions of Output

Swain identifies three distinct functions that output serves in language acquisition:

**The Noticing Function**: When learners attempt to produce language, they become aware of gaps in their knowledge. They notice that they cannot express exactly what they want to say with their current linguistic resources. This noticing triggers attention to relevant input and creates readiness for acquisition. For example, a learner trying to explain a past event might realise they lack the vocabulary or structures to do so effectively, making them more receptive to learning those forms when they encounter them.

**The Hypothesis-Testing Function**: Output provides opportunities for learners to test their hypotheses about how the language works. When learners produce an utterance, they receive feedback—explicit or implicit—about whether their hypothesis is correct. This might come from a teacher's correction, a conversational partner's confused expression, or the success or failure of communication. Through this feedback, learners refine their internal representations of the language.

**The Metalinguistic Function**: Producing language encourages learners to reflect on language form. When learners discuss language—explaining why something is correct or incorrect, comparing forms, or consciously analysing their own production—they engage in metalinguistic reflection that can deepen their understanding and consolidate their knowledge.

#### From Output to Dialogue

In her later work, Swain has extended the Output Hypothesis to emphasise the role of dialogue in language acquisition. She argues that collaborative dialogue—learners working together to solve linguistic problems—creates opportunities for language development that go beyond individual production. When learners negotiate meaning, co-construct knowledge, and scaffold each other's learning through interaction, they engage in what Swain calls "languaging"—using language as a tool for thinking and learning.

### Michael Long and the Interaction Hypothesis

Michael Long's Interaction Hypothesis represents another significant development beyond Krashen's input-focused model. Long argues that while comprehensible input is necessary for acquisition, it is not sufficient. What is crucial is the way that input becomes comprehensible through interaction.

#### Negotiation of Meaning

Central to Long's hypothesis is the concept of "negotiation of meaning." When communication breaks down—when one speaker does not understand the other—the participants engage in negotiation: they clarify, repeat, rephrase, and check understanding until communication is successful. This negotiation process makes input comprehensible while simultaneously drawing attention to linguistic form.

Long's research has shown that modified interaction—conversation adjusted to ensure comprehension—is more effective for acquisition than simply modified input. When learners are actively involved in negotiating meaning, they must engage deeply with the language, processing it at multiple levels to resolve communicative difficulties.

#### Types of Interactional Modification

Negotiation of meaning can involve various strategies:

**Clarification Requests**: When a listener indicates they do not understand ("What do you mean?", "Could you repeat that?"), the speaker must reformulate their message, often providing input that is more comprehensible.

**Comprehension Checks**: Speakers check whether they have been understood ("Do you see what I mean?", "Is that clear?"), creating opportunities to adjust their output if necessary.

**Confirmation Checks**: Listeners verify their understanding ("So you mean...?", "Are you saying that...?"), providing feedback to the speaker and potentially triggering further clarification.

**Recasts**: When a learner produces an error, an interlocutor might reformulate the utterance correctly while maintaining the focus on meaning ("Oh, you went to the cinema yesterday?" in response to "I go cinema yesterday"). Research suggests that recasts can facilitate acquisition by providing implicit negative feedback in a context where the learner's attention is focused on meaning.

#### The Updated Interaction Hypothesis

Long has refined his hypothesis over time, emphasising that interaction facilitates acquisition not merely by making input comprehensible, but by connecting form and meaning in ways that promote noticing. When negotiation of meaning draws attention to linguistic features that are causing communicative problems, learners are more likely to notice the gap between their current interlanguage and the target language, creating conditions for acquisition.

## Synthesis: Implications for the MFL Classroom

### Balancing Input and Output

Effective MFL teaching requires a balance between providing rich comprehensible input and creating opportunities for meaningful output. Neither alone is sufficient: input without output may result in receptive competence without productive ability, while output without sufficient input may result in fossilised errors and limited development.

Teachers should design lessons that include both input-rich activities (listening and reading tasks, stories, comprehensible teacher talk) and output opportunities (speaking and writing tasks, presentations, communicative activities). The two should be integrated, with output tasks often following input to allow learners to practise using language they have recently encountered.

### Creating Conditions for Acquisition

Several principles emerge from SLA theory for creating optimal conditions for language acquisition:

**Prioritise Comprehensibility**: Ensure that learners can understand the language they encounter. Use visuals, context, prior knowledge, and careful speech modification to make input comprehensible without oversimplifying to the point of inauthenticity.

**Focus on Meaning First**: Design activities where learners are focused on communication and meaning rather than on language forms. Form-focused instruction has its place, but should be subordinate to meaning-focused communication.

**Encourage Interaction**: Structure activities that require learners to negotiate meaning with each other and with the teacher. Pair work, group work, information-gap activities, and communicative games all create conditions for the interaction that drives acquisition.

**Provide Opportunities for Output**: Ensure that learners have regular opportunities to produce language—both spoken and written. Design output tasks that are meaningful and purposeful, not merely mechanical exercises.

**Lower the Affective Filter**: Create a classroom atmosphere where learners feel safe to take risks and make mistakes. Build confidence through achievable tasks and positive feedback. Address individual anxieties and ensure that all learners feel valued.

**Respect the Natural Order**: Recognise that learners will acquire structures in their own time, regardless of the order in which they are taught. Continue to provide rich input even when learners seem not to have acquired explicitly taught structures.

### Practical Classroom Applications

#### Input-Rich Activities

**Storytelling and Picture Stories**: Using visual support to make stories comprehensible while exposing learners to rich language.

**Authentic Materials with Scaffolding**: Adapting authentic texts through glossaries, pre-teaching of key vocabulary, and task design that supports comprehension.

**Extensive Reading and Listening**: Providing access to materials that learners can process independently, building fluency and vocabulary.

**Comprehensible Teacher Talk**: Using the target language for classroom management, explanations, and interaction, with careful attention to making speech comprehensible.

#### Output-Focused Activities

**Information Gap Activities**: Tasks where learners must communicate to complete a task, creating genuine need for output.

**Role-Play and Simulation**: Activities that simulate real-world communication, giving purpose to production.

**Collaborative Writing**: Tasks where learners work together to produce texts, engaging in the metalinguistic reflection that Swain identifies as crucial.

**Presentations and Projects**: Extended output opportunities that allow learners to use language for authentic purposes.

#### Interaction-Based Activities

**Pair and Group Work**: Regular opportunities for learner-learner interaction, where negotiation of meaning can occur.

**Task-Based Learning**: Designing lessons around communicative tasks that require interaction to complete.

**Communicative Games**: Activities that create conditions for natural negotiation of meaning while maintaining engagement.

### Assessment and Error Correction

SLA theory also informs approaches to assessment and error correction. Given that acquisition proceeds through a natural order and involves inevitable errors, teachers should:

**Distinguish Between Errors and Mistakes**: Errors reflect the learner's current interlanguage and are a natural part of acquisition. Mistakes are performance slips that the learner could self-correct. Focus correction on mistakes rather than developmental errors.

**Use Recasts Strategically**: Reformulate learner errors implicitly while maintaining focus on meaning, providing negative feedback without interrupting communication.

**Provide Opportunities for Self-Correction**: Give learners time to self-correct before providing the correct form, promoting the hypothesis-testing process.

**Assess Communicative Competence**: Evaluate learners on their ability to communicate meaning effectively, not merely on grammatical accuracy. Consider fluency, strategic competence, and sociolinguistic appropriateness alongside accuracy.

## Critiques and Contemporary Developments

While Krashen's Monitor Model and subsequent hypotheses have been enormously influential, they have not been without critique. Understanding these critiques helps teachers apply SLA theory critically and appropriately.

### Critiques of Krashen's Model

One major critique concerns the untestability of some of Krashen's claims. The distinction between acquisition and learning, while intuitively appealing, is difficult to operationalise for research purposes. How can we definitively determine whether a learner knows something through acquisition or learning? This has led some researchers to question whether the distinction is as clear-cut as Krashen suggests.

The Input Hypothesis has also been critiqued for being too vague. What exactly constitutes "i + 1"? How can teachers determine a learner's current level with sufficient precision to provide appropriate input? And is the formula the same for all learners, or do individual differences play a significant role?

Furthermore, research has suggested that explicit instruction in grammar may be more effective than Krashen acknowledged, particularly for certain types of learners and certain linguistic features. While acquisition through comprehensible input remains important, the rejection of explicit learning as a route to acquisition may have been overstated.

### Current Perspectives

Contemporary SLA research has moved toward more complex, multidimensional models that incorporate cognitive, social, and individual factors. Theories such as Skill Acquisition Theory, which views language development as a progression from controlled to automatic processing, complement earlier hypotheses by explaining how explicit knowledge can become implicit over time.

Complexity Theory and Dynamic Systems Theory represent another contemporary direction, viewing language acquisition as a complex, non-linear process involving the interaction of multiple variables. From this perspective, the regularities observed in acquisition orders are emergent properties of complex systems rather than evidence of fixed natural orders.

Sociocultural Theory, drawing on the work of Vygotsky, emphasises the fundamentally social nature of language learning. Rather than viewing acquisition as an individual cognitive process, sociocultural theorists see it as occurring through interaction in the Zone of Proximal Development, where learners can accomplish with support what they cannot yet do independently.

### Implications for Teachers

Despite the critiques and developments, the core insights of SLA theory remain valuable for classroom practice:

- Comprehensible input is essential for acquisition
- Affective factors significantly influence learning outcomes
- Opportunities for meaningful output promote development
- Interaction facilitates acquisition through negotiation of meaning
- Learners progress through developmental sequences that cannot be fundamentally altered by instruction

Teachers should approach SLA theory as a source of evidence-based principles rather than rigid prescriptions. The art of language teaching lies in applying these principles flexibly, adapting to the specific context, learners, and objectives of each lesson while remaining grounded in our understanding of how languages are acquired.
