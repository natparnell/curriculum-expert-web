# KS2 to KS3 Transition in Modern Foreign Languages

## Introduction: The Transition Challenge

The transition from Key Stage 2 to Key Stage 3 represents one of the most significant challenges in modern foreign language (MFL) education in England. Since September 2014, languages have been statutory at KS2, meaning that most pupils arrive in Year 7 with at least four years of formal language learning behind them. Yet research consistently shows that the transition experience is often characterised by repetition, demotivation, and a failure to build upon the linguistic foundations established in primary school.

This knowledge file examines the statutory framework, the pedagogical challenges, and evidence-informed strategies for creating coherent progression in MFL across the primary-secondary divide. Drawing upon DfE guidance, Ofsted research reviews, the Teaching Schools Council pedagogy review, and best practice from the Association for Language Learning (ALL), it provides curriculum leaders with actionable approaches to bridge the KS2-KS3 gap.

## Statutory Context: Building on Foundations

### The 2014 National Curriculum Requirements

The Department for Education's 2013 MFL programmes of study established a clear expectation for continuity between primary and secondary phases. The KS2 Programme of Study states that "language learning should establish the foundations of learning how to learn a language and enable pupils to develop an appreciation of how language works in addition to making substantial progress in one language."

Critically, the KS3 Programme of Study explicitly requires that teaching "should build on the foundations of language learning laid at KS2, whether pupils continue with the same language or take up a new one." This statutory expectation of cross-phase coherence places a legal obligation on secondary schools to understand and utilise what pupils have learned in primary school, rather than starting from a blank slate.

### The Scale of Primary Language Provision

Since 2014, French has been taught in approximately 75% of primary schools, Spanish in around 25%, and German in roughly 5%. While the statutory requirement exists, provision remains variable. Research by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) and the British Council has found that time allocation varies significantly, with most schools offering between 30-60 minutes per week. Staffing models also differ considerably, ranging from specialist language teachers to class teachers delivering languages alongside other subjects.

This variation creates a complex transition landscape. Secondary schools typically receive pupils with different amounts of language learning, different languages, different teaching approaches, and different levels of confidence. The challenge is not simply bridging a gap but managing a diverse landscape of prior learning.

## The Problem of "The Restart"

### Demotivation Through Repetition

Research by Hunt et al. (2008), summarised by the Research in Primary Languages (RiPL) network, identified repetition of material in secondary school as a strong demotivator for students. When pupils who have studied French for four years arrive in Year 7 to be taught "bonjour, je m'appelle..." once again, the message is clear: your primary learning did not count.

This perception is particularly damaging for pupils who felt successful in primary languages. Pupils who left Year 6 feeling confident in their language abilities can quickly become disengaged when placed in mixed-ability Year 7 groups that do not recognise their prior achievement. The House of Lords Library briefing on foreign languages (May 2024) noted that this demotivation disproportionately affects boys, disadvantaged pupils, and those with SEND, contributing to the low proportion of these groups engaging with languages beyond KS3.

### The Information Gap

A significant barrier to effective transition is the lack of reliable information about what pupils actually know and can do when they arrive in secondary school. The ASCL/ALL KS2-KS3 Transition Toolkit identifies this as a fundamental issue: secondary teachers often receive little or no data about pupils' primary language learning, and what data does exist may be incomplete or inconsistent.

Without accurate information about prior learning, secondary schools default to a "lowest common denominator" approach, teaching as if no language learning has occurred. This fails the majority of pupils who do have prior knowledge, while also potentially missing gaps in understanding that need addressing.

### Language Switching

Not all pupils continue with the same language from primary to secondary school. Where primary feeders teach different languages, or where secondary schools offer different options, pupils may switch languages entirely at KS3. This requires particular attention to transferable skills—the metalinguistic awareness, language learning strategies, and confidence that can transfer even when the target language changes.

## Progression Mapping: Defining What Pupils Should Know

### The Three Pillars of Language Knowledge

Ofsted's Curriculum Research Review for Languages (2021) identified three pillars that underpin high-quality language education: phonics, vocabulary, and grammar. A coherent transition must ensure progression in all three areas.

**Phonics:** Primary pupils should develop knowledge of sound-spelling correspondences in their target language. By the end of KS2, pupils should be able to read aloud unfamiliar words with reasonable accuracy and understand how phonics patterns differ from English. Secondary curricula need to consolidate this foundation while introducing more complex phonological features.

**Vocabulary:** The Ofsted review emphasises the importance of building a rich and useful vocabulary. Primary pupils typically acquire vocabulary thematically (family, pets, food, hobbies) with some high-frequency verb vocabulary. Secondary curricula need to map progression from concrete, familiar topics to more abstract and transactional language use.

**Grammar:** KS2 introduces basic grammatical concepts including gender, articles, adjectival agreement, simple present tense verbs, and negation. KS3 must build systematically on these foundations, ensuring that pupils understand grammatical terminology and can apply grammatical knowledge with increasing accuracy and complexity.

### Mapping Learning Objectives

Effective progression mapping requires identifying specific learning objectives for each term across KS2 and KS3, ensuring that Year 7 objectives explicitly build upon Year 6 rather than repeating them. This involves:

- Auditing what is taught in feeder primary schools
- Identifying common content and language-specific features
- Mapping Year 7 objectives that assume KS2 knowledge
- Creating differentiated pathways for pupils with different prior learning profiles
- Establishing assessment points that check understanding of prior learning before introducing new content

The Teaching Schools Council MFL Pedagogy Review (2016) recommended that "wherever possible, they should support language learning in primary schools and plan to build on pupils' primary school language knowledge." This requires active collaboration between primary and secondary colleagues, not passive reception of information.

## Practical Strategies for Bridging the Gap

### Diagnostic Assessment on Entry

Rather than assuming prior knowledge or teaching from zero, effective departments use diagnostic assessment early in Year 7 to establish what pupils actually know. This should assess:

- Phonics knowledge (reading aloud, sound-spelling correspondences)
- Core vocabulary (high-frequency words, thematic vocabulary)
- Grammatical understanding (terminology recognition, basic application)
- Listening comprehension at sentence and short text level
- Speaking confidence and range

Importantly, diagnostic assessment should be designed to reveal what pupils can do, not just what they cannot. ALL's recommendation that "pupils themselves know what they are particularly good at—what teachers call 'the transferable skills'" suggests involving pupils in understanding and articulating their own capabilities.

### Differentiated Transition Units

Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach to Year 7, some schools are developing differentiated transition units that provide pathways based on prior experience. The RiPL network and NCELP (National Centre for Excellence in Language Pedagogy) have both emphasised the importance of this approach.

For pupils with strong primary language backgrounds, units can focus on extending and consolidating knowledge, introducing more complex structures, and developing independence. For pupils with limited or no primary language experience, units can provide intensive catch-up while maintaining high expectations.

### Cross-Phase Collaboration

The ASCL/ALL Transition Toolkit represents a structured approach to primary-secondary collaboration. The toolkit provides editable documents that primary teachers can use to encapsulate what pupils have covered, creating an actionable checklist for secondary colleagues.

Effective collaboration includes:

- Regular meetings between primary and secondary language leads
- Shared CPD opportunities where primary and secondary teachers learn together
- Joint planning of transition units or topics
- Cross-phase moderation of pupil work
- Visits by secondary teachers to feeder primaries and vice versa
- Shared understanding of progression and expectations

### Building on Transferable Skills

When pupils switch languages between primary and secondary school, the focus must shift to transferable skills. Pupils who have learned French in primary school bring to Spanish or German:

- Understanding of how languages work (metalinguistic awareness)
- Strategies for vocabulary memorisation
- Experience of listening for gist and detail
- Confidence in speaking aloud in a foreign language
- Familiarity with language learning routines and expectations

Making these transferable skills explicit helps pupils see the value of their prior learning, even when the specific language changes. It also supports the development of language learning autonomy that will serve pupils across multiple languages.

## Assessment and Information Transfer

### Effective Data Sharing

The sixintoseven MFL Transition Pilot identified improved collaboration and dialogue between primary and secondary schools as a key objective. Effective data sharing includes:

- Standardised assessment information that secondary teachers can interpret
- Examples of pupil work demonstrating standards achieved
- Information about teaching approaches and resources used
- Pupil self-assessment of confidence and enjoyment
- Specific notes about pupils who may need additional support or challenge

The ASCL Transition Toolkit provides templates for this information, but the most important factor is the professional conversation between primary and secondary colleagues that accompanies the data.

### Portfolio Approaches

Some schools have found success with pupil portfolios or passports that travel with pupils from primary to secondary school. These might include:

- Examples of written work
- Recordings of speaking activities
- Self-assessment checklists
- Vocabulary banks and reference materials
- Certificates or achievements

The Language Magician game, developed through Erasmus+ funding and now available across Europe, provides one model for assessment that gives positive feedback to pupils while also generating data for teachers on performance across listening, reading, writing, phonics, and sentence-building.

## Pedagogical Approaches for Continuity

### Consistency in Phonics Teaching

The Ofsted review emphasised the importance of explicit phonics teaching, with inspectors noting the risk of "mush" in pupils' heads if phonics is not taught systematically. For transition purposes, secondary teachers need to understand what phonics knowledge pupils bring from primary school and ensure that Year 7 teaching reinforces and extends this foundation.

Where primary schools have used consistent phonics approaches, secondary teachers can build upon this directly. Where phonics teaching has been less systematic, Year 7 may need to include phonics consolidation. The NCELP schemes of work provide a model for systematic phonics progression from Year 7 onwards.

### Vocabulary Strategies

Primary pupils typically develop vocabulary through high-frequency exposure, visual support, and contextualised learning. Effective transition maintains these supportive strategies while gradually increasing demands:

- Building on known vocabulary to introduce related words (word families, cognates)
- Using etymology and word roots to support memory
- Developing independent vocabulary recording and revision strategies
- Introducing more abstract and academic vocabulary for KS3 topics

The Teaching Schools Council review noted the importance of careful planning of teacher and pupil use of the target language, ensuring that meanings are always clear while maximising exposure to authentic language use.

### Grammar Continuity

Grammar teaching in primary schools often emphasises pattern recognition and meaningful use over explicit terminology. Secondary teachers need to understand how grammar has been introduced in primary school and build upon this foundation:

- Revisiting grammatical concepts that pupils have encountered implicitly
- Introducing grammatical terminology explicitly where needed
- Developing understanding of how grammatical patterns work across contexts
- Building from word-level to sentence-level to text-level grammatical knowledge

The goal is not to teach grammar from scratch but to make explicit the grammatical knowledge that pupils have begun to develop implicitly, and to extend this knowledge systematically through KS3.

## Addressing Specific Transition Challenges

### Mixed Prior Experience

Where feeder primaries have different levels of language provision, secondary schools face the challenge of teaching classes with widely differing prior experience. Strategies include:

- Setting by prior knowledge for initial units (where timetable allows)
- Differentiated tasks within mixed-ability classes
- Peer support strategies pairing experienced linguists with beginners
- Curriculum materials that allow pupils to access content at different levels
- Rapid catch-up provision for pupils with limited prior learning

### Motivation and Identity

The transition from the familiar environment of primary school to the larger, more complex secondary environment can impact pupil confidence and motivation. For language learning, this is compounded by the transition from being "experienced Year 6 linguists" to being "beginner Year 7 pupils."

Maintaining motivation requires:

- Early opportunities for pupils to demonstrate and be recognised for their prior learning
- Challenging content that shows pupils they are progressing, not repeating
- Celebration of linguistic achievements
- Connections to real-world language use and cultural contexts
- Positive teacher expectations for all pupils, regardless of prior experience

### Pupils with SEND and EAL

The Ofsted review and House of Lords briefing both highlighted the particular challenges for pupils with SEND and those with English as an Additional Language. These pupils may have had less consistent access to primary language teaching or may find particular aspects of language learning more challenging.

Transition planning should include:

- Early identification of pupils who may need additional support
- Adapted materials that maintain high expectations while providing additional scaffolding
- Use of pupils' home languages as a resource where appropriate
- Clear communication with SENCOs and EAL leads about language learning needs

## Monitoring and Evaluating Transition

### Departmental Review

Effective transition requires ongoing monitoring and evaluation. Departmental leaders should regularly review:

- Pupil progress data from entry assessments through to end of Year 7
- Feedback from pupils about their experience of transition
- Feedback from primary colleagues about the usefulness of information shared
- Observations of teaching to check that prior learning is being built upon
- Uptake of languages at GCSE as a long-term indicator of motivation and success

### Whole-School Approach

While this file focuses on MFL specifically, transition is a whole-school issue. Effective MFL transition benefits from:

- Senior leadership commitment to cross-phase collaboration
- Joint primary-secondary CPD opportunities
- Shared assessment and data systems
- Calendar time allocated for transition activities
- Recognition of transition expertise in performance management

## Conclusion: Towards Seamless Progression

The statutory requirement for KS3 to "build on the foundations of language learning laid at KS2" sets a clear expectation, but achieving this in practice requires deliberate effort. The evidence is clear: when pupils experience repetition and lack of recognition for their primary learning, motivation suffers and achievement stalls. When transition is managed effectively, with clear progression mapping, diagnostic assessment, differentiated provision, and genuine cross-phase collaboration, pupils can continue to build their linguistic competence and confidence.

The resources and frameworks are available—the ASCL/ALL Transition Toolkit, the Teaching Schools Council Pedagogy Review, Ofsted's research evidence, and the growing body of NCELP materials all provide guidance. What matters now is implementation: the willingness of primary and secondary colleagues to work together, the commitment of secondary leaders to understanding and building upon primary learning, and the determination of all involved to ensure that every pupil's language learning journey continues seamlessly from Year 6 to Year 7 and beyond.

The goal is not simply to avoid the "restart" but to create a curriculum where pupils can see and experience their own progress, where teachers can build confidently on prior learning, and where the considerable investment in primary language education since 2014 translates into sustained linguistic development through secondary school and into lifelong language learning.
