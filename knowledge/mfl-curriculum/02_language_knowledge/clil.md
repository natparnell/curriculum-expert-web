# CLIL Approaches: Content and Language Integrated Learning

## Overview and Definition

Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) is a dual-focused educational approach in which an additional language is used for the learning and teaching of both content and language simultaneously. The term was coined in 1994 by David Marsh and colleagues at the University of Jyväskylä in Finland, and has since become a significant methodology in European and international language education.

CLIL is distinct from traditional foreign language instruction and from full immersion programmes. While language immersion typically involves teaching the majority of the curriculum through a target language, CLIL offers greater flexibility in implementation. It can be applied at the level of individual lessons, units of work, or whole-school programmes, and does not prescribe a specific proportion of curriculum time to be delivered in the target language.

The European Commission, through the Eurydice survey on CLIL at School in Europe (2006), defines CLIL as "an approach for learning content through an additional language (foreign or second), thus teaching both the subject and the language." This dual-focused nature distinguishes CLIL from both content-driven approaches that neglect language development and language-driven approaches that lack meaningful content.

## The 4Cs Framework: Core Principles

Do Coyle, along with colleagues Philip Hood and David Marsh, developed the 4Cs Framework as a conceptual model for effective CLIL implementation. This framework emphasises the interrelationship between four key dimensions that must be addressed in any CLIL programme.

### Content

Content refers to the subject matter, knowledge, skills, and understanding that students are expected to learn. In CLIL, content is not merely a vehicle for language practice; it constitutes legitimate curricular material that would be taught even in the students' first language. The content dimension ensures that CLIL maintains academic rigour and provides meaningful cognitive challenge.

Effective CLIL content selection considers:
- The appropriateness of topics for the students' cognitive developmental stage
- The potential for interdisciplinary connections
- The relevance to students' lives and interests
- The opportunities for meaningful language use that the content affords

Content in CLIL programmes spans the full curriculum, including science, mathematics, history, geography, physical education, arts, and technology subjects. The choice of content subjects depends on contextual factors including teacher expertise, available resources, and curriculum requirements.

### Communication

Communication in CLIL extends beyond the functional language of traditional foreign language teaching to encompass the academic language required for learning content subjects. Cummins (1984) distinguishes between Basic Interpersonal Communicative Skills (BICS) and Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP), noting that CLIL must address both.

The communication dimension involves:
- Language for learning: the functional language needed to operate in the classroom
- Language of learning: the subject-specific vocabulary and discourse patterns
- Language through learning: emergent language that arises during meaning-making

CLIL classrooms prioritise interaction and meaning negotiation. Students engage with content through collaborative activities, discussions, presentations, and extended writing, providing authentic purposes for language use. The communication dimension recognises that language development occurs most effectively when students are using language to accomplish meaningful tasks rather than practising language forms in isolation.

### Cognition

The cognition dimension addresses the thinking skills and cognitive processes involved in learning content through an additional language. CLIL is not simply about delivering existing content in a different linguistic medium; it requires careful consideration of how cognitive demands interact with linguistic demands.

Bloom's Taxonomy provides a useful framework for planning cognitive challenge in CLIL:
- **Remembering and Understanding:** Identifying, describing, recognising, classifying
- **Applying:** Using information in new situations, demonstrating, constructing
- **Analysing:** Comparing, organising, deconstructing, attributing
- **Evaluating:** Checking, critiquing, judging, defending
- **Creating:** Designing, constructing, planning, producing

Effective CLIL instruction scaffolds students to operate at higher cognitive levels while managing the additional linguistic demands. This may involve initially focusing on lower-order thinking skills when introducing new language, then gradually increasing cognitive challenge as language proficiency develops.

### Culture

The culture dimension in CLIL encompasses both cultural awareness and intercultural understanding. This includes:
- Awareness of the target language culture(s)
- Reflection on students' own cultural perspectives
- Development of intercultural communicative competence
- Understanding of how cultural contexts shape knowledge and communication

Culture in CLIL is not limited to surface-level cultural products but extends to deeper understanding of cultural perspectives and practices. The culture dimension supports the development of global citizenship and prepares students for participation in multilingual, multicultural contexts.

The 4Cs are not separate elements to be addressed sequentially but are integrated and interdependent. A successful CLIL lesson or programme addresses all four dimensions simultaneously, creating synergies that enhance both content and language learning beyond what would be achieved through separate instruction.

## Dual-Focused Instruction: Theoretical Foundations

CLIL is fundamentally characterised by its dual-focused nature, simultaneously targeting content learning and language development. This dual focus distinguishes CLIL from both content-based language instruction (where content serves primarily as a vehicle for language learning) and immersion education (where the primary focus is content with language development as a hoped-for by-product).

### The Interdependence Hypothesis

Cummins' Interdependence Hypothesis provides theoretical support for CLIL approaches. This hypothesis suggests that development in a second language is partially dependent upon the level of development already achieved in the first language. Concepts learned through one language become available for use through another language once sufficient proficiency has developed.

This cognitive interdependence means that:
- Students can transfer conceptual understanding from their first language to support content learning in the additional language
- Academic language proficiency developed in one language supports academic language development in another
- High-order thinking skills transfer across languages, allowing students to engage with cognitively demanding content even with developing language proficiency

### Sociocultural Theory

Vygotsky's sociocultural theory informs CLIL practice through its emphasis on social interaction as the foundation of learning. In CLIL classrooms, collaborative activities provide the social context within which language and content learning occur. The Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) — the gap between what learners can do independently and what they can achieve with support — is particularly relevant to CLIL, where learners regularly encounter content and language demands beyond their current independent capabilities.

### Output Hypothesis

Swain's Output Hypothesis suggests that language production (speaking and writing) drives language development more effectively than input alone. CLIL provides rich opportunities for output as students engage with content through discussion, presentation, and writing tasks. The need to express content understanding pushes students to stretch their linguistic resources and develop new language.

## Scaffolding Strategies in CLIL

Effective CLIL implementation requires sophisticated scaffolding to support students in managing the dual demands of content and language. Scaffolding refers to the temporary support provided to enable learners to accomplish tasks they cannot yet complete independently.

### Language Scaffolding

**Visual Support:**
- Graphic organisers, diagrams, and charts that make content relationships visible
- Word walls and visual dictionaries for subject-specific vocabulary
- Icons and symbols to support comprehension of written and spoken language
- Colour-coding for language functions (e.g., green for expressing opinions, blue for giving evidence)

**Linguistic Scaffolding:**
- Speaking frames and sentence starters that provide language structures for academic discourse
- Cloze procedures that allow students to focus on key vocabulary or structures
- Parallel texts in L1 and L2 that enable students to transfer understanding
- Glossaries and multilingual dictionaries specific to content topics

**Interactional Scaffolding:**
- Collaborative learning structures that distribute cognitive and linguistic demands
- Peer tutoring and buddy systems
- Group roles that provide language support (e.g., vocabulary checker, summariser)
- Think-Pair-Share and other structured discussion protocols

### Cognitive Scaffolding

**Task Structuring:**
- Breaking complex tasks into manageable steps
- Providing process checklists and success criteria
- Using concept attainment and other inductive teaching approaches
- Offering choice in task difficulty to match students' readiness

**Thinking Tools:**
- Graphic organisers for different thinking processes (compare/contrast, cause/effect, sequencing)
- Bloom's Taxonomy question stems to support higher-order thinking
- Visible Thinking Routines from Project Zero (Harvard Graduate School of Education)
- Thinking hats and other metacognitive frameworks

### Contextual Scaffolding

**Building Prior Knowledge:**
- Activating prior knowledge before introducing new content
- Connecting content to students' experiences and interests
- Using anticipation guides to focus attention on key concepts
- Providing background knowledge through L1 when necessary

**Assessment for Learning:**
- Regular checking for understanding using multiple modalities
- Feedback that addresses both content and language
- Self and peer assessment tools that develop metacognition
- Opportunities for revision and improvement

## Research Evidence for CLIL Effectiveness

The research base for CLIL has grown substantially since the approach was first articulated, though the British Council (TeachingEnglish) notes that "most current CLIL programmes are experimental" and "there are few sound research-based empirical studies" in some contexts.

### Language Development Outcomes

Research generally indicates positive effects of CLIL on language proficiency, particularly in receptive skills and academic language development. Key findings include:

**Vocabulary Acquisition:** Studies consistently show that CLIL students outperform their non-CLIL peers in measures of vocabulary breadth and depth. The contextualised, meaningful exposure to language in content lessons facilitates retention and appropriate use of vocabulary.

**Reading Comprehension:** CLIL students typically demonstrate stronger reading comprehension in the target language, attributed to extensive exposure to academic texts and the development of reading strategies in meaningful contexts.

**Listening Skills:** Regular exposure to subject teachers using the target language for authentic communicative purposes supports the development of listening comprehension, including the ability to understand extended discourse and academic language.

**Speaking and Writing:** Findings for productive skills are more mixed. While CLIL students often show greater fluency and willingness to communicate, they may not demonstrate equivalent advantages in accuracy, particularly grammatical accuracy. This suggests that CLIL alone may not be sufficient for full linguistic development and may need to be complemented with focused language instruction.

### Content Learning Outcomes

A critical question for CLIL is whether content learning suffers when instruction occurs through an additional language. Research generally suggests that well-implemented CLIL does not negatively impact content achievement and may, in some cases, enhance it.

The systematic review by Goris, Denessen, and Verhoeven (2019) examined longitudinal experimental studies of CLIL effects on English language skills in Europe. They found that robust studies were undertaken in only a limited number of European countries, and that only a few were large-scale. However, available evidence suggested that CLIL can be effective when properly implemented with appropriate teacher training and support.

### Cognitive Benefits

Some research suggests that CLIL may confer cognitive benefits beyond language and content learning, including:
- Enhanced metalinguistic awareness
- Improved problem-solving abilities
- Greater cognitive flexibility
- Development of learning strategies that transfer across contexts

These potential benefits align with broader research on bilingual education and its effects on cognitive development.

## CLIL Implementation in the United Kingdom

CLIL implementation in the UK context presents both opportunities and challenges that differ from the European contexts where CLIL first developed.

### Policy Context

Unlike many European countries where CLIL has received significant policy support at the national level, CLIL in the UK has developed primarily through individual school and teacher initiative. The Association for Language Learning (ALL) notes that "in the UK the Ofsted focus on challenging content creates a focus for interest on curriculum development, which may encourage schools to adopt such an approach in some measure."

The UK educational context is characterised by:
- A predominantly monolingual culture that does not prioritise multilingualism in the same way as many European countries
- Curriculum pressures that may limit time available for innovative approaches
- Assessment structures that are primarily English-medium
- A shortage of teachers with the dual competencies required for effective CLIL

### Types of CLIL in UK Schools

CLIL in UK schools takes various forms, reflecting local contexts and available expertise:

**Soft CLIL:** Many UK implementations represent "soft CLIL" — thematic or cross-curricular units where language and content are integrated for limited periods, rather than full subject teaching through the target language. This approach is more manageable for teachers developing CLIL expertise and allows flexibility within the existing curriculum.

**Hard CLIL:** Some schools, particularly in the independent sector and in areas with specific linguistic demographics, implement "hard CLIL" where entire subjects or substantial portions of the curriculum are taught through the target language. This approach requires significant investment in teacher training and development.

**Cross-curricular Projects:** Many UK schools adopt CLIL principles through cross-curricular projects that integrate language learning with subjects such as geography, history, or science. These projects may involve collaboration between language and subject specialists.

### Subject Areas for CLIL

In UK contexts, certain subject areas lend themselves particularly well to CLIL approaches:

**Geography:** The concrete, visual nature of much geographical content, combined with cultural connections to target language countries, makes geography a popular choice for CLIL.

**History:** History provides opportunities to explore different perspectives and develop cultural understanding, though the linguistic demands of abstract historical concepts require careful scaffolding.

**Science:** The universal nature of scientific concepts and the support of visual and practical elements make science accessible for CLIL, though technical vocabulary presents challenges.

**Physical Education and Arts:** These subjects, with their emphasis on demonstration and practical activity, can provide accessible entry points for CLIL, particularly for students with lower language proficiency.

## Teacher Knowledge and Professional Development

Effective CLIL teaching requires a distinctive knowledge base that combines content expertise, language pedagogy, and CLIL-specific competencies.

### The CLIL Teacher Knowledge Framework

Research at the University of Cambridge Faculty of Education has developed frameworks for understanding the professional knowledge required for CLIL teaching. This research identifies several key domains:

**Content Knowledge:** Secure understanding of the subject matter being taught, including concepts, procedures, and disciplinary ways of thinking.

**Pedagogical Content Knowledge:** Understanding of how to teach specific content, including knowledge of typical student conceptions, misconceptions, and learning progressions.

**Language Knowledge:** Proficiency in the target language at a level appropriate for academic instruction, including awareness of academic language demands.

**Pedagogical Language Knowledge:** Understanding of how to support language development, including knowledge of scaffolding strategies, vocabulary instruction, and interaction patterns.

**CLIL-Specific Knowledge:** Understanding of CLIL principles, the 4Cs framework, and how to integrate content and language objectives in planning and instruction.

### Professional Development Needs

The British Council and other organisations identify significant professional development needs for CLIL teachers:

**Initial Training:** Most initial teacher education programmes do not include specific preparation for CLIL, leaving teachers to develop expertise through continuing professional development.

**Collaborative Development:** Effective CLIL professional development often involves collaboration between language and subject specialists, allowing teachers to develop understanding of each other's domains.

**Reflection and Inquiry:** CLIL teachers benefit from opportunities to engage in reflective practice and classroom-based inquiry, examining the effects of their pedagogical choices on student learning.

**International Networks:** Connecting with CLIL practitioners internationally, particularly in European contexts where CLIL is more established, can provide valuable perspectives and resources.

## Challenges and Considerations

Despite its potential benefits, CLIL implementation faces significant challenges that must be addressed for successful adoption.

### Teacher Competence and Confidence

The most frequently cited barrier to CLIL implementation is the shortage of teachers with appropriate dual competencies. Teachers may be:
- Content specialists lacking confidence in their target language proficiency
- Language specialists lacking confidence in their content knowledge
- Either group lacking training in CLIL pedagogy

Addressing this challenge requires sustained investment in professional development and creative approaches to teacher collaboration.

### Assessment

Assessment in CLIL presents challenges at multiple levels:
- Should assessments focus on content, language, or both?
- How can fair assessment of content knowledge be ensured when students are working in an additional language?
- How can progress in language development be tracked alongside content achievement?

Effective CLIL assessment uses a range of approaches including:
- Differentiated assessment criteria that account for language proficiency
- Multiple assessment modalities that allow students to demonstrate understanding through different means
- Formative assessment approaches that provide ongoing feedback for both content and language development

### Differentiation

CLIL classrooms typically include students with diverse language proficiencies and content backgrounds. Differentiation strategies include:
- Tiered tasks that provide different levels of support
- Flexible grouping based on language proficiency and content readiness
- Choice in task completion modes
- Additional scaffolding for students with lower language proficiency

### Time and Resources

CLIL requires significant investment in:
- Curriculum development and materials adaptation
- Teacher professional development
- Resource development and procurement
- Planning time, particularly when teachers are collaborating across subject boundaries

Schools considering CLIL implementation must be realistic about these resource requirements and plan for sustained commitment rather than short-term initiatives.

## Planning for CLIL: Practical Guidance

Effective CLIL requires careful planning that addresses both content and language dimensions.

### Unit Planning

CLIL unit planning should:
- Identify content objectives aligned with the curriculum
- Identify language objectives that support content learning and develop academic language proficiency
- Plan for the integration of the 4Cs throughout the unit
- Sequence learning to build both content understanding and language proficiency progressively
- Include appropriate assessment for both content and language

### Lesson Planning

Individual CLIL lessons should:
- Begin with activation of prior knowledge, providing linguistic support as needed
- Present new content through multiple modalities (visual, auditory, kinaesthetic)
- Include collaborative activities that require interaction in the target language
- Provide scaffolding that can be gradually reduced as students develop proficiency
- Conclude with opportunities for students to demonstrate learning and consolidate new language

### Language Awareness in Planning

Teachers should analyse the language demands of content topics, identifying:
- Key subject-specific vocabulary that must be taught explicitly
- Academic language functions required (describing, explaining, comparing, evaluating)
- Text types and genres that students will encounter and produce
- Potential cognates and language features that may support or confuse learners
