# Grammar in MFL Teaching: Progression, Explicit Instruction and Pedagogical Approaches

## Introduction: Grammar as One of the Three Pillars

The teaching of grammar in Modern Foreign Languages (MFL) occupies a central position in contemporary curriculum design, recognised by both the Teaching Schools Council (2016) MFL Pedagogy Review and Ofsted's Curriculum Research Review (2021) as one of the "three pillars of progression": **phonics, vocabulary and grammar**. These three pillars represent the foundational building blocks upon which successful language learning is constructed, with each pillar supporting and reinforcing the others in an integrated approach to language acquisition.

According to the MFL Pedagogy Review, pupils need to gain systematic knowledge of "the vocabulary, grammar, and sound and spelling systems (phonics) of their new language, and how these are used by speakers of the language." This systematic knowledge includes not merely the implicit ability to use grammatical structures, but also "the explicit knowledge of the grammar of a language, and the associated terminology." The Review emphasises that this aspect of linguistic knowledge "does not come automatically with competence in the language, but is important for teaching of the language to non-native speakers."

Ofsted's research review reinforces this position, identifying that effective MFL curricula are "carefully planned around logical pupil progression in the 'three pillars' of language: phonics, vocabulary, grammar." Teachers' use of the target language is carefully planned and tailored to build on pupils' ability, with grammatical structures introduced systematically and revisited regularly to develop both receptive and productive competence.

## The Explicit versus Implicit Grammar Teaching Debate

### The Case for Explicit Grammar Instruction

Explicit grammar teaching involves the deliberate, systematic presentation of grammatical rules, structures and terminology to learners, typically with clear explanation in the first language (L1) or the target language (L2), followed by controlled practice activities. The MFL Pedagogy Review (2016) and subsequent Department for Education guidance through the National Centre for Excellence for Language Pedagogy (NCELP) have strongly advocated for explicit grammar instruction, particularly at Key Stages 3 and 4.

Research underpinning the explicit approach suggests that learners, particularly those in secondary education, benefit from understanding the organisational systems of language. As Ellis (2010) and Spada (2007) have demonstrated through applied linguistic research, explicit grammar teaching should feature in instructional contexts alongside communicative activities. The National Curriculum for MFL (DfE, 2013) embeds this expectation, requiring that pupils "use and manipulate a variety of key grammatical structures and patterns, including voices and moods, as appropriate."

NCELP's implementation of the MFL Pedagogy Review recommendations emphasises a structured approach where grammar is taught explicitly through a presentation-practice-production (PPP) sequence. This approach typically involves: (1) presentation of a grammatical point with clear explanation and examples; (2) controlled practice through structured exercises; and (3) production activities that allow learners to apply the grammar in communicative contexts.

### The Case for Implicit and Chunk-Based Approaches

In contrast to explicit instruction, implicit grammar teaching—often associated with the Extensive Processing Instruction (EPI) approach developed by Gianfranco Conti—prioritises the acquisition of grammatical patterns through exposure to and use of formulaic language chunks. The underlying theoretical basis draws on usage-based theories of language acquisition, which posit that learners internalise grammatical patterns through repeated exposure to multi-word units rather than through rule learning.

Conti and others argue that "learners pick up grammatical patterns naturally by repeatedly encountering chunks in context." In this view, chunk-based learning is more effective than explicit grammar instruction for developing fluency. A student can achieve fluent production of "J'ai joue au foot" without knowing all the tenses of jouer or all persons of the perfect tense; this fluency is achieved through practice with unanalysed chunks that can later be varied using sentence builders and L1 translation.

The EPI approach, structured around the MARSEARS sequence (Modelling, Awareness-raising, Receptive processing, Structured production, Expansion, Autonomy, Routinisation, Spontaneity), introduces grammar implicitly through sentence builders—essentially chunks of language presented visually that demonstrate grammatical patterns in context. As practitioners following this methodology explain: "We introduce the new language via sentence builders which are essentially chunks of language."

### Hybrid and Balanced Approaches

In practice, many MFL departments in England have adopted hybrid approaches that combine elements of both explicit and implicit instruction. The Reddit practitioner community documents this trend clearly: "We do do explicit grammar, but we do it after we've introduced the 'pattern' through a sentence builder, and been talking about the grammar of it linked to the sentence builders all the way through—both implicit and explicit."

In the EPI model, this hybridity is formalised through a short "Awareness-raising" phase (the first A in MARSEARS) immediately after initial modelling via sentence builders, followed by a more robust explicit grammar teaching phase (the E in MARSEARS) after three or four lessons of receptive and productive retrieval of the target chunks. This staged approach acknowledges that while chunks provide the foundation for fluency, explicit understanding of grammatical systems supports accuracy and the creative extension of learned patterns.

Similarly, NCELP practitioners have been observed combining approaches, with some teachers "'hybridizing' it, as it were, combining their existing approach or other approaches with mine (e.g. NCELP + EPI) creatively adapting EPI to their learning context."

## Grammar Progression Across Key Stages

### Early Years and Key Stage 1: Foundational Encounters

While MFL is not statutory in the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) or Key Stage 1, many primary schools introduce language learning during these phases. The primary focus is on developing phonological awareness and oral confidence rather than explicit grammar instruction. However, even at this early stage, children encounter grammatical patterns implicitly through songs, rhymes and simple formulaic expressions.

The relationship between MFL and aspects of English learning is noteworthy: as the archived National Curriculum guidance noted, MFL teaching at primary level can reinforce "aspects of English such as speaking and listening skills, knowledge and understanding of grammatical structures and sentence construction." This cross-linguistic transfer suggests that even implicit exposure to L2 grammar can support metalinguistic awareness.

### Key Stage 2: Building Grammatical Foundations

The statutory entitlement for all Key Stage 2 pupils (aged 7–11) to access MFL teaching, implemented in September 2014, established the foundation for systematic grammar instruction. By the end of Key Stage 2, pupils should have encountered basic grammatical concepts including "conjunctions, regular and irregular high frequency verbs, verb conjugation, opinions and justifications."

The progression through Key Stage 2 typically follows a sequence from formulaic chunks to simple pattern recognition:

- **Year 3–4**: Heavy reliance on unanalysed chunks and formulaic phrases; implicit exposure to word order and gender patterns
- **Year 5–6**: Introduction to regular verb conjugation in the present tense; recognition of simple sentence structures; explicit teaching of key grammatical terminology such as "verb," "noun" and "adjective"

Schools following the NCELP Primary MFL Development Programme apply the three knowledge strands (phonics, vocabulary, grammar) with careful consideration of design implications for each. Grammar at this stage is often taught through pattern-spotting activities and analogy rather than rule memorisation.

### Key Stage 3: Systematic Grammar Development

Key Stage 3 represents the period of most intensive grammatical development, with the curriculum designed to prepare pupils for the demands of GCSE. The National Curriculum requirements for Key Stage 3 specify that pupils must "use and manipulate a variety of key grammatical structures and patterns, including voices and moods, as appropriate."

The typical Key Stage 3 grammar progression follows this sequence:

**Year 7**: Consolidation of present tense regular verbs; introduction to common irregular verbs (etre, avoir, ir verbs in Spanish); basic sentence structures (subject-verb-object); simple negation; question formation; introduction to adjectival agreement.

**Year 8**: Introduction to past tenses (perfect tense in French, preterite in Spanish); future tense (near and simple); introduction to reflexive verbs; modal verbs; more complex negation (ne...rien, ne...personne); comparative and superlative forms.

**Year 9**: Introduction to imperfect tense; conditional mood; more complex sentence structures with subordinate clauses; relative pronouns; passive voice introduction (French); consolidation and extension of all prior structures.

Schools with well-designed curricula plan "a coherent sequence of lessons—knowledge, skills and understanding will be built on and applied in a cumulative manner." This cumulative approach ensures that grammatical structures are revisited and extended rather than taught in isolation.

### Key Stage 4: GCSE Grammar Requirements

By the end of Key Stage 4, students taking GCSE MFL are expected to "know at least three tenses with some irregular verbs, know a good range of higher-level grammar structures and other complex grammar phrases and be able to be creative with the language and apply grammatical rules." The GCSE course "builds on students' language skills in Key Stage 3," revisiting grammatical structures seen previously whilst introducing more complicated grammar required at this level.

The AQA GCSE specifications for French, German and Spanish include detailed grammar annexes specifying the structures students must know. These include:

- **Tenses**: Present, perfect, imperfect, future (both near and simple), conditional; with some specifications now including pluperfect and subjunctive mood
- **Verbs**: Regular and irregular conjugations; reflexive verbs; modal verbs; verbs with prepositions
- **Nouns and articles**: Gender recognition; partitive articles; demonstratives
- **Adjectives**: Agreement rules; position; comparative and superlative forms including irregulars (meilleur, pire)
- **Pronouns**: Subject, object, reflexive, relative, demonstrative, possessive
- **Other structures**: Negation in all forms; question formation; adverbs and adverbial phrases; passive voice (French); word order variations

The new GCSE specifications (first teaching September 2024, first exams Summer 2026) have refined these requirements, with updated grammar lists and vocabulary lists that more clearly specify what students must know and be able to use.

## Key Grammatical Structures by Stage

### Essential Primary Structures (KS2)

The following grammatical patterns form the foundation for subsequent learning:

1. **Gender and Articles**: Recognition of masculine/feminine distinction; use of definite and indefinite articles (le/la/les, un/une/des in French; el/la/los/las, un/una/unos/unas in Spanish)

2. **Present Tense Regular Verbs**: First, second and third conjugation patterns (-er/-re/-ir verbs)

3. **Key Irregular Verbs**: High-frequency irregulars (etre, avoir, aller, faire in French; ser, estar, ir, tener in Spanish)

4. **Simple Negation**: Basic ne...pas / no structures

5. **Adjectival Agreement**: Position and agreement of common adjectives (typically those preceding the noun in French)

6. **Question Words**: Recognition and use of qui, que, quand, ou, pourquoi, comment / quien, que, cuando, donde, por que, como

### Core Secondary Structures (KS3)

Building on primary foundations, Key Stage 3 introduces:

1. **Multiple Tenses**: Perfect tense formation (auxiliary + past participle); preterite regular and key irregulars; near future (aller + infinitive / ir a + infinitive); simple future stem changes

2. **Complex Negation**: Ne...jamais, ne...rien, ne...personne, ne...plus structures

3. **Reflexive Verbs**: Daily routine verbs with reflexive pronouns; present and perfect tense usage

4. **Modal Verbs**: Pouvoir, devoir, vouloir / poder, deber, querer with infinitive constructions

5. **Object Pronouns**: Direct and indirect object pronouns in present tense; position before the verb in French, clitic climbing in Spanish

6. **Comparative and Superlative**: Regular patterns (plus/moins/aussi...que / mas/menos/tan...que); key irregular forms

7. **Relative Clauses**: Introduction to qui and que / que and quien

### Advanced GCSE Structures (KS4)

The GCSE curriculum demands confident use of:

1. **All Tenses**: Present, perfect, imperfect, future, conditional; with awareness of pluperfect and passive voice

2. **Subjunctive Mood**: Present subjunctive in formulaic expressions and subordinate clauses following certain triggers

3. **Complex Pronoun Usage**: Double object pronouns; pronouns in compound tenses; relative pronouns beyond qui/que (dont, lequel / cuyo, el cual)

4. **Passive Constructions**: Etre + past participle with par (French); ser + past participle (Spanish)

5. **Reported Speech**: Tense shifting following il a dit que / dijo que

6. **Advanced Negation**: Ne...aucun, ne...ni...ni structures

7. **Complex Conjunctions**: Subordinating conjunctions requiring subjunctive; conjunctions of time, cause, purpose and concession

## Pedagogical Approaches to Grammar Teaching

### The Sentence Builder Methodology

Central to contemporary MFL pedagogy, particularly in EPI-influenced classrooms, is the use of **sentence builders**—visual scaffolds that present chunks of language in tabular format, demonstrating how vocabulary items combine according to grammatical patterns. Sentence builders function as "essentially chunks of language" that allow learners to produce correct sentences through selection and combination rather than through rule application.

The pedagogical sequence with sentence builders typically follows this pattern:

1. **Modelling**: Teacher presents the sentence builder, modelling pronunciation and meaning through translation or visual support
2. **Choral Repetition**: Whole-class and individual repetition of chunks, with attention to phonics patterns
3. **Delayed Dictation**: Learners hear chunks, hold them in working memory, then write them
4. **Sentence Construction**: Learners combine elements from the sentence builder to create personalised utterances
5. **Gradual Removal of Scaffolding**: As confidence develops, learners produce language without the visual support

As practitioners note, sentence builders are "prepared...to include a wide range of words containing key sounds...and at some point, as we do with grammar, this is explicitly pointed out." This integration of phonics, vocabulary and grammar through the same pedagogical tool exemplifies the three pillars approach.

### Explicit Grammar Sequences

Where explicit grammar instruction is employed, effective practice typically follows a structured sequence:

1. **Presentation**: Clear explanation of the rule with well-chosen examples; use of colour-coding or highlighting to make patterns visible; L1 explanation of terminology where necessary
2. **Noticing Activities**: Guided discovery tasks where learners identify patterns in presented examples; concept checking questions to verify understanding
3. **Controlled Practice**: Structured exercises focusing on accuracy: gap-fills, verb conjugation tables, substitution drills; error correction focused on the target structure
4. **Guided Production**: Scaffolded writing or speaking tasks requiring use of the target structure; teacher monitoring and targeted feedback
5. **Free Production**: Communicative activities where the target structure is used meaningfully but not exclusively; peer and teacher feedback on accuracy and message
6. **Retrieval Practice**: Spaced revisiting of the structure in subsequent lessons to support long-term retention

### Integrating Grammar with the Four Skills

Effective grammar teaching integrates grammatical development across all four language skills:

**Listening**: Exposure to target structures in comprehensible input; dictation activities that focus attention on grammatical forms; listening exercises that require identification of specific grammatical features (tense markers, negation, etc.)

**Speaking**: Structured production through sentence builders; choral repetition focusing on accurate pronunciation of grammatical morphemes; information-gap activities requiring specific grammatical structures; spontaneous speaking tasks that elicit particular patterns

**Reading**: Narrow reading texts that repeatedly use target structures; grammatical analysis of authentic texts; comprehension questions that require attention to grammatical markers (tense, aspect, mood)

**Writing**: Scaffolded writing frames incorporating target structures; translation activities (both into and from the target language) that require grammatical accuracy; free writing with checklists focusing on grammatical accuracy

## Common Misconceptions and Challenges

### Pupil Misconceptions

Research and classroom experience identify recurring misconceptions that impede grammatical development:

1. **Tense Confusion**: Pupils often conflate the perfect and imperfect tenses in French, or the preterite and imperfect in Spanish, struggling to understand aspectual differences (completed vs. ongoing action).

2. **Gender Attribution**: English-speaking learners frequently struggle with grammatical gender, assuming that gender correlates with biological sex or that all inanimate objects are neuter.

3. **Adjectival Position**: The English pattern of adjectives preceding nouns leads to persistent errors in French and Spanish where many adjectives follow the noun.

4. **Pronoun Position**: French object pronouns preceding the verb conflicts with English word order; Spanish clitic pronouns similarly cause difficulty.

5. **False Friends**: Words that appear similar across languages but function grammatically differently (actual vs. actuel/actual; deception vs. deception/decepcion).

6. **Literal Translation**: Applying English word order or structure directly into the target language, particularly with questions (I like... -> J'aime... rather than inverted forms) and negation.

### Pedagogical Challenges

Teachers face several challenges in implementing effective grammar instruction:

1. **Time Allocation**: Balancing explicit grammar instruction with communicative practice and cultural content within limited curriculum time.

2. **Differentiation**: Supporting pupils who grasp grammatical concepts quickly while ensuring those who struggle receive adequate support and practice.

3. **Knowledge Retention**: Ensuring that grammatical knowledge taught in one unit is retained and can be applied in subsequent topics; the "mastery" problem.

4. **Transfer and Application**: Moving pupils from controlled practice to spontaneous, accurate use in free production.

5. **L1 Interference**: Addressing persistent interference from English structure and word order.

## Conclusion

Grammar teaching in MFL occupies a contested but essential position in the curriculum. The debate between explicit and implicit approaches is not a binary choice but a spectrum of pedagogical possibilities, with the most effective practice often combining elements of both.
## Assessment of Grammatical Knowledge

### Formative Assessment Strategies

Effective assessment of grammar in MFL serves both accountability and learning purposes. Formative assessment strategies focus on identifying misconceptions and guiding instructional decisions:

**Diagnostic Assessment**: At the beginning of units, brief translation or manipulation tasks identify which structures pupils have retained from prior learning and which require revisiting. This might include verb conjugation tests, gap-fill exercises targeting specific structures, or error correction activities.

**In-Lesson Checking**: Concept checking questions during explicit instruction verify understanding before pupils attempt independent practice. Teachers might ask "What happens to the adjective in French if the noun is feminine?" or "Which auxiliary verb do we use with movement verbs in the perfect tense?"

**Retrieval Practice**: Regular low-stakes quizzing of previously taught structures supports long-term retention. This might involve verb tables, translation of previously learned chunks, or identification of grammatical features in reading texts.

**Error Analysis**: Systematic tracking of error types across pupil work identifies persistent areas of difficulty. Common patterns might include consistent problems with adjectival agreement, tense formation, or pronoun position.

### Summative Assessment at GCSE

The AQA GCSE specifications assess grammar through multiple components:

**Paper 1: Listening (25%)**: Pupils demonstrate understanding of spoken language featuring prescribed grammatical structures. The Foundation tier includes a grammar-focused question type requiring identification of specific linguistic features.

**Paper 2: Speaking (25%)**: The photocard and general conversation tasks assess ability to use grammar accurately in spontaneous production. Higher marks require use of "a variety of grammatical structures, including some more complex forms."

**Paper 3: Reading (25%)**: Translation into English assesses comprehension of grammatical meaning; inference tasks require understanding how grammatical markers convey nuance.

**Paper 4: Writing (25%)**: Translation into the target language and free writing tasks directly assess grammatical accuracy. The mark schemes reward "appropriate and accurate use of the prescribed vocabulary and grammatical structures, including some more complex forms" at Higher tier.

### Ofsted Expectations

Ofsted's curriculum research review makes clear that assessment should align with curriculum intent:

> "Assessment should use a range of tasks, including those focused on specific aspects of the language taught, such as vocabulary or grammar. Some tasks should require pupils to compose sentences, short pieces of writing and oral presentations."

This suggests that effective grammar assessment includes:

- **Discrete grammar tasks** that isolate specific structures for assessment
- **Integrated tasks** that assess grammatical accuracy within communicative activities
- **Varied task types** that prevent pupils from relying on formulaic responses
- **Progressive complexity** that reflects the developing grammar curriculum
